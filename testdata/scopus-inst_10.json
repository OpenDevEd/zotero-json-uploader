      "dc:description": "Constructing Bayesian networks (BN) for practical applications presents significant challenges, especially in domains with limited empirical data available. In such situations, field experts are often consulted to estimate the model’s parameters, for instance, rank correlations in Gaussian copula-based Bayesian networks (GCBN). Because there is no consensus on a ‘best’ approach for eliciting these correlations, this paper proposes a framework that uses probabilities of concordance for assessing dependence, and the dependence calibration score to aggregate experts’ judgments. To demonstrate the relevance of our approach, the latter is implemented to populate a GCBN intended to estimate the condition of air handling units’ components—a key challenge in building asset management. While the elicitation of concordance probabilities was well received by the questionnaire respondents, the analysis of the results reveals notable disparities in the experts’ ability to quantify uncertainty. Moreover, the application of the dependence calibration aggregation method was hindered by the absence of relevant seed variables, thus failing to evaluate the participants’ field expertise. All in all, while the authors do not recommend to use the current model in practice, this study suggests that concordance probabilities should be further explored as an alternative approach for the elicitation of dependence.",

      "dc:description": "This study conducts a Social Life Cycle Assessment (S-LCA) of Rainwater Harvesting Systems (RWHS) in Mexico City to evaluate their social performance. Given the city's pressing water scarcity, RWHS have become critical for promoting water autonomy and sustainable urban development. The research integrates quantitative data from surveys and interviews with RWHS users and organizational employees, along with qualitative analysis using the Product Social Impact Assessment (PSIA) approach. This methodology allows for a thorough examination of socio-environmental dynamics influenced by RWHS adoption. Our findings show high acceptance of RWHS among users and highlight progressive labor practices, underscoring RWHS's potential to transform urban water management. This study, the first to evaluate this ecotechnology through an S-LCA, identifies the need for a multidimensional approach to understand socio-economic and environmental intersections with water systems. It also underscores NGOs' role in facilitating technology transfer and adoption in urban communities. Recommendations include extending the S-LCA methodology to cover the entire RWHS lifecycle and incorporating broader social science theories to deepen understanding of water sustainability interventions. The results offer new insights into RWHS assessment, emphasizing the complexities of deploying decentralized water technologies in a mega-city and laying groundwork for policy recommendations that support sustainable, equitable water access.",

      "dc:description": "In Intersectionality, philosopher Naomi Zack presents a novel philosophical account of intersectionality - the process by which people already oppressed, experience more oppression because of their intersecting identities. Examples include women who experience racism or poor people who are under-served. Identifying such intersections allows for more precise analysis of oppression, as well as newly recognized identities, such as blackwomen or homeless people of colour. Zack here explores the meaning of intersectionality through analysis of current events and controversies including the #MeToo movement, the COVID-19 pandemic, and class opportunities for minorities in higher education. Her analysis develops a robust definition of intersectionality in terms of inclusion, recognition, and diversity; works out ontological issues about the relationship between persons, labels, and identity; explores the distinction between abstract philosophical thinking and activism; and discusses how intersectionality can be an effective basis for empowerment, as well as understanding. Zack's distinctively philosophical account explains how intersectionality, considered as a method of analysis, works and can be employed in many areas of progressive thought across varying disciplines. She concludes that identifying and challenging the injustice of oppressions logically requires a broad humanistic framework, that intersectionality cannot be reduced to mere talk of diversity and inclusion, and that intersectionality itself is a progressive method of analysis worthy of philosophical attention.",

However, their use still remains limited for complex tasks such as shopping. While some studies find that consumers are willing to use them, others report negative reactions that lead to rejection, especially for complex activities. This study aims to bridge the gap between the dichotomous streams of literature by investigating the overall attitude towards the use of AI VAs for a multi-step task that is, shopping. We first identify 27 attitudinal criteria through a comprehensive literature review in light of the Uncanny Valley Theory and the Self Determination Theory. The criteria are organized using the cognitive, affective and conative framework of attitude, and ranked using the Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process. Sensitivity analysis is done to affirm the robustness of the framework. Findings reveal that the behavioral intentions to use (conative criteria) are the strongest, followed by feelings evoked during use (affective criteria), followed by beliefs people hold regarding AI VAs (cognitive criteria). Intention to use AI voice assistants during all stages of the purchase journey takes precedence over negative feelings such as loss of control, unfulfillment and vulnerability. This study reconciles the existing stream of literature on conversational AI and provides managerial implications based on the dimensions of attitude.",

      "dc:description": "Proper daylight management through automated or manual blind systems can enhance user comfort and energy conservation. Furthermore, the influence of weather conditions, coupled with occupant behavior, significantly impacts energy consumption, rendering weather forecasts invaluable in conducting individual building energy simulations to identify energy-efficient strategies for the future. Also, I wonder if it is possible to move some items from room 308 until you can provide items from other resources. Future weather conditions and their impact on building performance can be evaluated using Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) scenarios provided by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). This research aimed to compare the energy usage of manual and automated window blinds with internal blinds in mid-size office buildings across four main climate zones (2B Hot-Dry; 2A Hot-Humid; 7 Very Cold; 4A Mixed-Humid) in the USA under current and future climate change scenarios (RCP 4.5, 8.5). Utilizing simulation as the methodology and comparing the energy use resulting from the RCP 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios revealed that the most significant decrease in heating energy usage was happening in the Hot-Humid zone with Automated blinds, which is a more efficient alternative than manual Blinds. In contrast, the Very Cold zone experienced almost no changes in either heating or cooling energy consumption. In Climate Zones 2B Hot-Dry and 7 Very Cold, rising temperatures lead to increased cooling energy requirements and reduced heating demands due to climate changes. Climate Zone 4A Mixed-Humid saw reduced energy consumption for cooling but increased usage for heating, particularly under RCP 8.5. In Zone 2A Hot-Humid, a high demand for heating energy was found.",

      "dc:description": "As a spreader of knowledge, universities must be practical examples of sustainable applications, including building or intervening in their buildings. However, some authors point out that universities focus more on the social dimension of sustainability than the environmental one, emphasizing the need for research aimed at environmental sustainability in these places. In this context, university campuses present emblematic buildings with historical and architectural relevance with more than 20 years old and still need analyses in terms of thermal performance. Among these traditional buildings on university campuses are the libraries, usually proposed in open floor plans, with spaces for collaborative study and an integrated collection of books. However, both spaces must meet different criteria of thermal performance and conservation of books, which is associated with the internal microclimate and consequently with the adequacy of climatic conditions. The main objective of this research was to analyze the environmental sustainability in iconic libraries through transdisciplinary procedures, where the thermal performance and conservation of books from the Library of the Federal University of Uberlândia (UFU Library), Brazil, were jointly evaluated. The analyzed spaces have open floor plans with natural ventilation, a communal study area, and a collection of related books for consultation. The method adopted was the hygrothermal simulation based on the BIM/BES data transfer, having as parameters the operating temperature ranges according to (ASHRAE 55 (2020) Thermal environmental conditions for human occupancy. ASHRAE, Atlanta) and the isoperm method of (Sebera in Isoperms an environmental management tool. Comission on Preservation and Access, Washington (1997)). We concluded that the hygrothermal simulation contributes to environmental sustainability since it allows the analysis of the current scenario of the library, as well as the creation of new scenarios. Regarding the thermal performance, we observe that the appropriate scenario is the current one, as it presented service between 82.15% and 86.88% of the occupied periods throughout the year. The proposed scenario with double glazing did not present significant temperature differences concerning the current scenario. Regarding the book conservation, we concluded that the current scenario is unsatisfactory, with isosperms between 0.28 and 1. That corresponds to the longevity of the paper between 12.6 and 45 years. Unfortunately, the data transfer between BIM/BES could have been finer since there were errors in the transfer of geometry, thermal properties, and information such as usage, occupation, and scheduling.",

      "dc:description": "Urban pollution significantly influences historic building preservation via chemical, physical, and biological processes. To plan heritage structure restoration, we must study fired brick mineralogy and its correlation with firing temperature. We must also examine how atmospheric pollutants have affected surface composition over time. This study analyzes medieval bricks from seven medieval buildings in Brașov, Romania. We used physicochemical methods (XRD, SEM-EDS, and FTIR-ATR) to identify brick minerals, estimate firing temperatures, and investigate weathering compounds due to pollutants. Samples show quartz, clay minerals (muscovite, illite, palygorskite/smectite anh., kaolinite anh.), feldspars (microcline, orthoclase, albite, andesine), and carbonates (calcite) (for the bricks estimated to be fired at ∼800 °C); sanidine, gelhenite (for the bricks estimated to be fired at ∼950 °C); anorthite, wollastonite, diopside, spinel, mullite (for the bricks estimated to be fired at ∼1100 °C). Weathering varies by mineralogy, firing temperature, location, and pollutants, including efflorescence (CaCO3), black crust (gypsum, calcite), and organic/bio-organic compounds. Mitigation strategies based on physicochemical studies aim to protect cultural heritage from pollution's adverse effects for future generations. This study is vital globally for preserving cultural heritage, offering insights into mitigating the impact of pollution on historic buildings. It aids in developing universal conservation strategies, ensuring our shared past's longevity and aesthetic value.",

      "dc:description": "This paper presents a detailed comparative analysis of the performance and energy consumption of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems as standalone units and integrated systems, specifically focusing on semiconductor manufacturing facilities (SMFs). Highlighting the urgent need for HVAC system optimization to minimize energy waste and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the study uncovers distinct energy consumption patterns across residential, commercial, and industrial sectors, emphasizing the unique needs of SMFs. It reveals the need for more current energy codes and standards in addressing the specialized energy demands of semiconductor fabrication plants (fabs), thereby advocating for a customized HVAC energy-design framework to enhance energy efficiency within these facilities. The research is divided into three main segments: (1) identifying the key factors that drive HVAC systems' energy consumption, (2) examining the factors that influence system performance, and (3) analyzing how these factors impact the optimization of HVAC systems in SMFs. By developing a framework that integrates design, engineering, and energy consumption data, the paper lays the groundwork for a data-intensive design approach tailor-made to meet the energy efficiency requirements of semiconductor fabs. The study's pivotal findings highlight the deficiencies of existing energy codes and standards for SMFs and propose a bespoke HVAC energy design framework. This strategy identifies critical energy consumption and performance factors unique to SMFs, recommending a data-driven design method for enhanced energy efficiency. This forward-thinking approach aims to significantly reduce energy waste and greenhouse gas emissions, establishing a new benchmark for sustainable practices in semiconductor manufacturing.",

      "dc:description": "The shift towards net zero design for the construction industry poses complex challenges, which can be likened to a three-headed hydra embodying energy, water, and carbon emissions. The industry stakeholders have grappled with addressing the challenges due to an ineffective reductionist approach that targets each head (energy, water, and carbon) separately. Recognizing their interdependence, this study proposes a holistic panacea approach to facilitate the industry’s transition to net zero design. This was achieved using a mixed (quantitative and qualitative) research methodology. The qualitative study was conducted using a three-stage Delphi technique involving 13 experts. Structural equation modeling was used for the quantitative involving 200 construction stakeholders selected randomly. The study discovered that net-zero design integrates sustainability concepts, such as net-zero energy, water, and carbon aimed at ensuring a sustainable built environment. Factors like innovation, organizational culture, and construction project management were identified as pivotal in steering the construction industry toward net zero design. The transition to net zero design can be impeded by poor cost management and restrictive organizational cultures. The study recommended that stakeholders in the construction industry should embrace a culture that supports the commitment to net zero design.",

      "dc:description": "Countries have been driven to undertake energy conservation measures to lessen their negative environmental effects due to rising CO2 emissions worldwide. To effectively forecast the future status and evaluate the efficacy of energy-saving and mitigation scenarios, estimating energy consumption and the associated CO2 emissions from fossil fuels is essential. The domestic sector in Iran, liable for using around 30% of the total energy consumption, is the focus of this research. The research has developed a model for future energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions distinctive to the features of the Iranian residential building stock by considering climate change and using statistical data. To assess prospective results, the Business-As-Usual and energy conservation scenarios are compared. The research also evaluates the potential of energy savings and CO2 reduction across several provinces. The fulfillment of the energy compliance requirements confined in the National Building Regulations by considering the impact of climate change on energy consumption in dwellings of different climate regions has been prioritized. The results show that under different mitigation scenarios, CO2 emissions in the household sector are projected to decrease by 15.7%, 18.4%, 26.8%, and 31.8% by 2030 and 2050. According to the Paris Agreement, these reductions are consistent with Iran's Intended Nationally Determined Contribution. The study emphasizes the significance of targeted measures and policy implementations to lower CO2 emissions in the domestic sector substantially, supporting global efforts to mitigate climate change. The methodology described here addresses energy-related challenges within the constraints of available data on the residential building stock statistic. While acknowledging the potential for further refinement, the country's development of a detailed typology of residential buildings holds promise for enhancing the precision of the modeling in future studies and enabling more robust assessments of energy-saving strategies.",
