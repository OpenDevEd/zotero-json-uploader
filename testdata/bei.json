        "Background: Artificial Intelligence (AI) literacy is a crucial part of digital literacy that all individuals should possess in today's technologically advanced world. Despite the potential benefits that AI education offers, little research has been done on how to teach AI literacy to children. Objectives: This study aimed to fill that gap by investigating how children were engaged in AI literacy activities that are supported by intelligent agents. These activities were implemented in a Hong Kong kindergarten with a class of six 5‐year‐olds (Mage = 62.83 months, SD = 2.91) over a 6‐week period. Methods: The study gathered data from multiple sources, including classroom observations, teacher interviews, and documents/artefacts. Results and Conclusions: The results showed that children could learn about AI through interaction with intelligent agents in embodied learning contexts. The findings of this study have implications for the broader field of digital technology education, particularly in the context of early childhood education. Lay Description: What is already known about this topic: Artificial Intelligence (AI) literacy is essential in today's world.Little research exists on engaging young children in learning AI literacy. What this paper adds: Technology‐enhanced embodied learning approach affords multimodality in enabling young children's learning with AI‐related agents.Project‐based learning and real‐life examples can enhance children's learning. Implications for practice and/or policy: Early exposure to AI can help children navigate the increasingly digital world.Practical approaches, such as embodied and multimodal learning, seem to be effective.Teachers can enhance children's digital learning by using pedagogical strategies like project‐based learning and real‐life examples.

        "Play is crucial to children's development. With the prevalent use of digital technologies, children and young adults are seen playing games more often and longer on digital devices. How should teachers capitalize the advantages of games in class, without inducing more health risks or problems for children? To achieve this goal, teachers need empirical details and conclusive results in the application of game-based learning (GBL) in primary education, so that they can design GBL experiences that cater to the specific needs of pupils. The present paper provides a systematic review for 35 experimental studies that substantially integrated gaming elements in primary school lessons. Our major findings include that (1) most studies were published in technology-assisted learning journals, focusing on higher-grade students' natural science learning, through one GBL lesson conducted within one week; (2) theoretical foundations were absent in the majority of studies, with the rest implicitly or explicitly drawing upon Constructivist premises; (3) adopted GBL technologies were mostly self-designed, and used for formal learning; (4) Gamification was the most frequently used game genre and Intellectual Problem-Solving was the top gaming element to be incorporated and (5) there were more positive outcomes than mixed findings and more cognitive results reported than affective or behavioral dimensions.

        "Games have been used as a learning tool for centuries. Gamification and game-based learning are becoming more prominent in educational settings for several reasons. When it comes to learning, being focused and immersed can massively improve a student's experience. The purpose of this study is to map the emerging trends of gamification and game-based learning (GBL) in the Vocational and Education Training (VET) sector. For this purpose, a Systematic Literature Review was conducted through the three most relevant scientific databases – Web of Science, Scopus, ScienceDirect, and PubMed with Google Scholar as a supporting database. The obtained sample was further selected following the PRISMA guidelines with screening and eligibility processes conducted based on inclusion criteria that were defined with consideration to the research's aim. This review comprised seventeen studies. The findings revealed a growing interest in the Asian continents in research from 2020 onwards. Furthermore, most of the study is centred on vocational schools and colleges in the engineering and healthcare fields. According to the overview, the digital learning platform and simulation technology are the most promising tools used in the research. The findings support the conclusion that gamification and game-based learning can improve academic performance, engagement, and motivation in vocational education learners. As a result, this study suggests that more research is needed to determine the gamification strategies that are most suited for vocational education and learning. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "As instruction shifts away from traditional approaches, online learning has grown in popularity in K-12 and higher education. Artificial intelligence (AI) and learning analytics methods such as machine learning have been used by educational scholars to support online learners on a large scale. However, the fairness of AI prediction in educational contexts has received insufficient attention, which can increase educational inequality. This study aims to fill this gap by proposing a fair logistic regression (Fair-LR) algorithm. Specifically, we developed Fair-LR and compared it with fairness-unaware AI models (Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, and Random Forest). We evaluated fairness with equalized odds that caters to statistical type I and II errors in predictions across demographic subgroups. The results showed that the Fair-LR could generate desirable predictive accuracy while achieving better fairness. The findings implied that the educational community could adopt a methodological shift to achieve accurate and fair AI to support learning and reduce bias. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "Background: The number of artificial intelligence (AI) literacy studies in K‐12 education has recently increased, with most research focusing on primary and secondary education contexts. Little research focuses on AI literacy programs in early childhood education. Objectives: The aim of this mixed‐methods study is to examine the feasibility of an AI literacy program called \"AI4KG\" and explore how it might affect kindergarteners' perceptions of robots and attitudes towards engineering and science. Methods: A total of 26 child–parent dyads recruited from a Hong Kong kindergarten were involved in this study, consisting of 26 children (Mage = 4 years, SD = 0.28) and their parents. Quantitative and qualitative data were collected through surveys and interviews designed to explore children's perceptions of robots and attitudes towards engineering and science, and parents' perceptions of the AI4KG intervention. Results: It is found that children have increased their perceptions of robots after the AI literacy program, but the AI4KG curriculum had no significant effects on kindergarten children's engineering and science attitudes. Most parents (22 out of 26) agreed that their children's AI knowledge, AI skills, and AI attitudes have been enhanced after learning through the AI4KG curriculum. Conclusions: This study suggests that the AI4KG curriculum is potentially effective in promoting early AI literacy and favourable attitudes towards the technology, but further research is needed to develop age‐appropriate measures and assess its long‐term impact on children's education and career paths. Lay Description: What is currently known about this topic?: AI literacy is becoming important as AI transforms society, but few studies have explored AI literacy in early childhood education.Prior research found AI activities can positively influence older children's views of robots and engineering. What does this paper add?: It evaluates an 8‐week AI literacy curriculum called AI4KG for kindergarteners in Hong Kong.The curriculum used tools like Teachable Machine and taught concepts through play and storytelling.It improved children's perceptions of robots but did not significantly impact engineering/science attitudes.Parents perceived improvements in children's AI knowledge, skills, and attitudes after the curriculum. Implications for practice/policy: The curriculum provides an example for developing age‐appropriate AI literacy activities.More rigorous research on impacts over time is needed, but results suggest potential benefits of AI literacy in early childhood.Policymakers could consider incorporating AI literacy into kindergarten curricula to prepare children for the future.

        "Artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots are gaining increasing popularity in education. Due to their increasing popularity, many empirical studies have been devoted to exploring the effects of AI chatbots on students' learning outcomes. The proliferation of experimental studies has highlighted the need to summarize and synthesize the inconsistent findings about the effects of AI chatbots on students' learning outcomes. However, few reviews focused on the meta‐analysis of the effects of AI chatbots on students' learning outcomes. The present study performed a meta‐analysis of 24 randomized studies utilizing Stata software (version 14). The main goal of the current study was to meta‐analytically examine the effects of AI chatbots on students' learning outcomes and the moderating effects of educational levels and intervention duration. The results indicated that AI chatbots had a large effect on students' learning outcomes. Moreover, AI chatbots had a greater effect on students in higher education, compared to those in primary education and secondary education. In addition, short interventions were found to have a stronger effect on students' learning outcomes than long interventions. It could be explained by the argument that the novelty effects of AI chatbots could improve learning outcomes in short interventions, but it has worn off in the long interventions. Future designers and educators should make attempt to increase students' learning outcomes by equipping AI chatbots with human‐like avatars, gamification elements and emotional intelligence. Practitioner notesWhat is already known about this topicIn recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots have been gaining increasing popularity in education.Studies undertaken so far have provided conflicting evidence concerning the effects of AI chatbots on students' learning outcomes.There has remained a paucity of meta‐analyses synthesizing the contradictory findings about the effects of AI chatbots on students' learning outcomes.What this paper addsThis study, through meta‐analysis, synthesized these recent findings about the effects of AI chatbots on students' learning outcomes.This study found that AI chatbots could have a large effect on students' learning outcomes.This study found that the effects of AI chatbots were moderated by educational levels and intervention duration.Implications for practice and/or policyAI chatbot designers could make AI chatbots better by equipping AI chatbots with human‐like avatars, gamification elements and emotional intelligencePractitioners and/or teachers should draw attention to the positive and negative effects of AI chatbots on students.Considering the importance of ChatGPT, more research is required to develop a better understanding of the effects of ChatGPT in education.More research is needed to examine the mechanisms underlying the effects of AI chatbots on students' learning outcomes.

        "K-12 artificial intelligence (AI) education requires cultivating students' computational thinking in the school curriculum so as to transfer their computational thinking to diverse problems and authentic contexts. However, students may be limited by traditional computational thinking development activities because they may have a lower degree of computational thinking efficacy for persistent learning of AI when encountering difficulties (computational thinking efficacy in learning AI). Accordingly, this study aimed to explore the relationships among Chinese secondary school students' computational thinking efficacy in learning AI, their AI literacy, and approaches to learning AI. Structural equation modeling was adopted to examine the mediation effect. Data were gathered from 509 Chinese secondary school students, and the confirmatory factor analyses showed that the measures had high reliability and validity. The results revealed that AI literacy was positively related to students' computational thinking efficacy in learning AI, which was mediated by more sophisticated approaches to learning AI, contributing to the current understanding of learning AI. It is crucial to focus on students' AI literacy and deep approaches (e.g., engaging in authentic AI contexts with systematic learning activities for in-depth understanding of AI knowledge) rather than surface approaches (e.g., memorizing AI knowledge) to develop their high-level computational thinking efficacy in learning AI. Implications for designing the AI curriculum are discussed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "This paper explores whether a Serbia preschool institution is prepared for education during the pandemic. The research subject is nine kindergarten-preschool units where 140 teachers work with about 2500 children up to 6.5 years. We examined all teachers that work in preschool units. The study aims, for a case study of music education, to answer: Whether the COVID-19 pandemic affected the change in the educational work in the field of music in preschool; Can web-based applications and educational resources improve preschool music outcomes, especially during a pandemic; Would web applications and educational resources reduce financial costs; Would web applications and educational resources enhance parent-teacher communication. The findings show preschool teachers mostly use traditional offline educational techniques and tools but need more online learning tools, Web resources, and applications, especially when working remotely. They believe such resources can reduce financial costs and improve parent-teacher communication. The study found that the pandemic has forced changes in practice. However, according to teachers, these changes can enhance future post-pandemic practice thanks to web-based educational technologies that more closely connect all participants in early childhood education.

        "Background: A practical test that measures the information and communication technology (ICT) skills students need for effectively using ICT in primary education has yet to be developed (Oh et al., 2021). This paper reports on the development, validation, and reliability of a test measuring primary school students' ICT skills required for effectively using ICT (the ECC‐ICT test). Objectives: Based on existing literature, three ICT use domains were identified for effectively using ICT: Effective, collaborative, and creativeuse of ICT. For these three domains, 24 corresponding teaching objectives were identified from a widely used digital literacy framework. Thirty‐four test items cover these teaching objectives in an online test. Methods: A mixed‐method approach was used for the ECC‐ICT test. Four pilot rounds (n=25) implemented qualitative interviews for cognitive validity and refining the test items, followed by a qualitative usability study(n=6). Confirmatory factor analysis and ANOVA provided quantitative insight into the large‐scale test administration(n=575). Results and Conclusions: Composite reliability of our conceptual 3‐factor confirmatory model showed that the test reliably measured primary school effective use of ICT (ω = 0.82), collaborative use of ICT (ω = 0.80) and creative use of ICT (ω = 0.64). Convergent validity (ranging from 0.41 to 0.46) was acceptable. Internal consistency (ranging from 0.84 to 0.91) and discriminant validity (HTMT values below 0.90) are good. ANOVA results show that mean test scores are higher for students in higher grade levels (p < 0.001). The post hoc Bonferroni results show that most grade‐by‐grade comparisons are significant (p < 0.001). Lay Description: What is already known about this topic: Information and communication technology (ICT) skills are finding their way into national curriculums as teachers implement more digital learning environments.Teachers currently do not have a measurement instrument for the ICT skills primary education students need to learn in a personalised way. What this paper adds: This paper gives teachers a test that reliably measures the effective, collaborative, and creative ICT skills required for primary school students to learn using ICT.To our knowledge, this test is the first of its kind.Al materials to reproduce the test are available digitally for teachers. The implications of study findings for practitioners: For policy, this test can be used to check if a student is ready to use ICT in a self‐regulated setting.With this test, teachers can assess and support students' growth on the effective, collaborative, and creative ICT skills required for primary school students using ICT.

        "This study determines the critical success factors for students and academic staff when applying and evaluating online delivery methods in colleges and universities in Kuwait. The recently implemented eLearning systems and methods in the country, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, are evaluated and the perception of the eLearning system is gauged. Targeted surveys are distributed to a representative sample of undergraduate engineering students and academic staff. The following critical success factors are considered: benefits of the eLearning system, educational system quality, information quality, instructor quality, learner quality, service quality and technical system quality. Results show that there is a correlation between the perceptions of students and academic staff, particularly regarding instructor quality, information quality and benefits of the eLearning system. Both groups of respondents agreed on the high importance of instructor quality and the low importance of benefits. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "In the last two decades, there has been a global movement towards pedagogies that create more inclusive school environments in order to meet the needs of diverse learners. One such approach is Universal Design for Learning (UDL), which foregrounds the design of flexible and accessible learning experiences for all, regardless of learner characteristics. Technology is a key enabler in this. To date, much of the research on UDL has focused on its impact in higher education, with less evidence available on the use of UDL within second‐level education. This systematic literature review of n = 15 empirical studies selected from a wide‐ranging search that returned an initial result of n = 1253 explores how the affordances of digital technology have been harnessed for UDL enactment at second level. The findings show that, to date, empirical research at second level has focused mostly on the easy wins within the UDL principle of Representation, where educators offer choice about how learners access content. However, there is a clear gap in UDL research on the use of technologies to support the Engagement and Action & Expression principles of UDL, supporting student self‐regulation and self‐assessment, and on technology‐mediated communication and collaboration. The paper highlights the potential for future cross‐pollination of research in educational technology with UDL. Practitioner NotesWhat is already known about this topicUniversal Design for Learning has been extensively researched in higher education and special education contexts but much less so at K‐12, in particular at second level.Technology offers many affordances that can provide choice and variation in the learning process, which can be harnessed in a UDL approach.The transformative potential of technology in educational contexts was not fully realised pre‐COVID.The COVID pandemic saw an acceleration in technology adoption for learning, but it remains to be seen whether technology is being deployed to complement or transform existing practices.What this paper addsThis paper clearly identifies which affordances of technology are commonly deployed in UDL implementations, particularly noting the provision of choice through multi‐media options for Representation and expression.There is a clear gap in UDL research on the use of technologies to support self‐regulation and self‐assessment, (eg, peer, teacher and automated feedback tools) and on technology‐mediated communication and collaboration.The UDL literature does not address the potential negative impacts of technology within the learning context or the short‐lived nature of positive impacts (novelty effect).Implications for practice and/or policyWhile technology affords great opportunities for choice and Engagement, the design of the learning experience must take priority, availing of technology as needed.There are great opportunities for cross‐pollination of research at the forefront of educational technology and universal design to address any gaps in technology use in UDL implementations.

        "Over the past few years, the world's attention has been focused on gaming systems and their application in education through gamification, incorporating game features into learning tools. Against this backdrop, this study aims to investigate the motivation of EFL learners in a Gamified Formative Assessment (GFA). Theoretical insights from self-determination theory (SDT) are synthesized in the context of motivation analysis and internalization. Data from interviews and questionnaires are collected, and pair-t-tests and basic linear regression, CiteSpace, are utilized for data evaluation and literature review. Paired t-tests for the control group (CG) and the experimental group (EG) in the first and second stages, as well as the EG's first and second stages, show a strong positive correlation between CG's scores in stages one and two and EG's scores in both stages (r1 = 0.930, r2 = 0.851, r3 = 0.953, p < 0.001). It is found that Quizizz, as an example of GFA, can enhance EFL learners' internalization at a higher level during their learning process. Furthermore, our findings also suggest that gamification enables most EFL learners to recognize the value and benefits of assessment as motivation for identified regulation. Additionally, the overall accuracy of the students in the EG, which is 89.05%, is higher compared to the CG's accuracy of 74.01%. It is interesting to note that their motivation level correlates with their performance and engagement. With these findings, we contribute to the literature by validating that gamified formative assessment fosters the internalization of EFL at the elementary level, thereby enhancing students' engagement and language proficiency. Therefore, as one of the studies on gamification and motivation, this research holds unique value in analyzing EFL instruction at the primary school level. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "Artificial intelligence is the unification of philosophy, cognitive science, mathematics, neurophysiology, psychology, computer science, information theory, cybernetics, and uncertainty theory. Therefore, it is feasible and necessary to utilize STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Liberal Arts, and Mathematics) education to learn artificial intelligence courses. Computational thinking skills are of vital importance to high school students. This paper integrates artificial intelligence education with STEAM model with the aim of enhancing students' computational thinking skills. First, we investigate the feasibility of this model and set teaching objectives about artificial intelligence curricula. Second, artificial intelligence curricula with STEAM model is proposed to carry out interdisciplinary artificial intelligence knowledge acquisition. Finally, the effects of this model on students' computational thinking skills, learning motivation, and self-efficacy are evaluated. One hundred thirty-six participants are recruited from a high school in Beijing. The results reveal that the integration of artificial intelligence education with STEAM is able to promote computational thinking skills, learning motivation, and self-efficacy of the students in the experimental group. The main implication of this study is that artificial intelligence education in light of STEAM model can be used as a teaching guide for the combination of artificial intelligence curricula with multi-disciplinary knowledge at the primary and secondary levels.

        "Background: Even though monitoring and control enactment are key aspects of self‐regulated learning (SRL), Adaptive learning technologies (ALTs) may reduce the need for learners to monitor and control their learning. Personalized dashboards are effective in supporting learners' monitoring and can potentially support control behaviour. Allowing learners to enact control over their learning process, seems to hold potential for increasing their motivation. Objectives: Therefore, this study's aim was to investigate the relation between control enactment and motivation. We examined how learners enacted control while learning with an ALT with personalized dashboards and examined the relation between learners' enactment of control and their motivation. Methods: Seventy‐eight primary school learners (Grade 5) participated. During the lesson, learners worked on mathematics in the ALT and concurrently were shown personalized visualizations that supported monitoring and enacting control over their learning process. Learners could enact control to change problems' difficulty to easy, medium, or hard. Motivation was measured before and after learning. Results: The SEM analyses showed that how learners enacted control was related to their motivation. Choosing difficult problems was related to more enjoyment and competence while choosing easy problems related to more pressure and tension. Learners who complied with the suggested difficulty level experienced less choice, but also less pressure/tension and more enjoyment and competence. Conclusions: These results provide avenues to account for broader learner characteristics like SRL and motivation to optimize learning. This way, hybrid systems in which control enactment is a shared responsibility of the system and learner, can be improved to support SRL development. Lay Description: What is currently known: Monitor and control enactment are key aspects of self‐regulated learning (SRL).Adaptive learning technologies may reduce the need for learners to monitor and control their learning.Personalized dashboards support learners' monitoring behaviour and can potentially also support control enactment.Enactment of control could positively affect learners' motivation. What does this paper add: There is a large variation in how learners enact control and whether they comply with the scaffold.Learners who chose more difficult problems experienced more enjoyment, while learners choosing easy problems, experienced more pressure.Learners complied with the scaffold, experienced less choice, but also less pressure and more enjoyment.This study provides avenues to account for broader learner characteristics like SRL and motivation to optimize learning. Practical implications: Support control enactment by actively involve learners in choice during the learning process.Offer monitor and enactment in conjunction, as learners can only make well‐founded choices if they can monitor their learning process.Intrinsically and extrinsically motivated learners showed different choice patterns and learning experience.It is important to have an understanding and monitoring of learners' motivation.

        "Artificial intelligence (AI) can enhance teachers' capabilities by sharing control over different parts of learning activities. This is especially true for complex learning activities, such as dynamic learning transitions where students move between individual and collaborative learning in un‐planned ways, as the need arises. Yet, few initiatives have emerged considering how shared responsibility between teachers and AI can support learning and how teachers' voices might be included to inform design decisions. The goal of our article is twofold. First, we describe a secondary analysis of our co‐design process comprising six design methods to understand how teachers conceptualise sharing control with an AI co‐orchestration tool, called Pair‐Up. We worked with 76 middle school math teachers, each taking part in one to three methods, to create a co‐orchestration tool that supports dynamic combinations of individual and collaborative learning using two AI‐based tutoring systems. We leveraged qualitative content analysis to examine teachers' views about sharing control with Pair‐Up, and we describe high‐level insights about the human‐AI interaction, including control, trust, responsibility, efficiency, and accuracy. Secondly, we use our results as an example showcasing how human‐centred learning analytics can be applied to the design of human‐AI technologies and share reflections for human‐AI technology designers regarding the methods that might be fruitful to elicit teacher feedback and ideas. Our findings illustrate the design of a novel co‐orchestration tool to facilitate the transitions between individual and collaborative learning and highlight considerations and reflections for designers of similar systems. Practitioner notesWhat is already known about this topic: Artificial Intelligence (AI) can help teachers facilitate complex classroom activities, such as having students move between individual and collaborative learning in unplanned ways.Designers should use human‐centred design approaches to give teachers a voice in deciding what AI might do in the classroom and if or how they want to share control with it.What this paper adds: Presents teacher views about how they want to share control with AI to support students moving between individual and collaborative learning.Describes how we adapted six design methods to design AI features.Illustrates a complete, iterative process to create human‐AI interactions to support teachers as they facilitate students moving from individual to collaborative learning.Implications for practice: We share five implications for designers that teachers highlighted as necessary when designing AI‐features, including control, trust, responsibility, efficiency and accuracy.Our work also includes a reflection on our design process and implications for future design processes.

        "Building on past studies showing that mobile learning improves learning outcomes and differs within a domain (e.g., science), this meta-analysis models domain-specific differences (e.g., learning activities) that drive these differences in science performance. A systematic database search (i.e., Web of Science, JSTOR, ERIC, PsycINFO, ProQuest Dissertations, and ACM) identified controlled experiments. A meta-analysis determined the overall effect of mobile learning on 4,145 primary and secondary school students' science achievement, and tested for moderator effects across 57 effect sizes from 44 studies. Mobile learning increased science achievement (g =.857). Mobile learning's effect sizes were larger for (a) inquiry or game-based learning, than other learning activities; (b) biology, and progressively smaller for earth and space sciences, chemistry, and physics; (c) activities jointly led by students and teachers, followed by those led by students; and then those led by teachers; (d) collectivistic countries than individualistic ones; and (e) primary or middle school students. Intervention duration, device type, learning environment, and publication year showed no moderation effects. Hence, a comprehensive theory of mobile learning must include age, learning approach, subject area, user roles, and cultural values. These results also suggest that science educators using mobile learning might improve student learning by (a) integrating it with science inquiry or game-based learning, (b) starting with biology before other science topics, (c) using learning activities jointly led by students and teachers, (d) starting with primary or middle school, and (e) starting with students in countries with collectivist cultural values to help one another.

        "Background: Deep discussions play an important role in students' online learning. However, researchers have largely focused on engaging students in deep discussions in online asynchronous forums. Few studies have investigated how to promote deep discussion via mobile instant messaging (MIM). Objectives: In this study, we applied learning analytical tools (i.e., KBdeX and word clouds) to enhance students' shared epistemic agency and thereby support their deep discussions in MIM. Methods: Forty Chinese college students participated in this study and reflected on their MIM engagement by participating in the learning analytics (LA)‐augmented meta‐discourse sessions. The study used multiple data analysis methods, including content analysis, statistical analysis, epistemic network analysis and lag sequential analysis. Results: We found that LA engaged students in deep discussions and shared epistemic agency‐related discourse, such as creating shared understanding, creating knowledge objects, and projective and regulative processes. In particular, word clouds engaged students in more complete shared epistemic agency discourse trajectory which started from creating awareness of unknowns, then progressed to setting projective plans and sharing information, and ultimately, creating shared understanding. Moreover, our analysis indicated that epistemic agency discourse moves of creating shared understanding led students to a high level of deep discussion. Implications: This study contributes to research by extending the 'comparison paradigm', which focuses on comparing (a)synchronous forums with MIM, to a 'design paradigm', which mobilises design features from (a)synchronous forums to MIM and using learning analytical tools to engage students in deep online discussions by promoting their epistemic agency. Lay Description: What is known in this subject matter: Supporting students' online deep discussions is important.Prior studies have shown multiple technological and pedagogical strategies to support deep discussions in (a)synchronous discussion forums, but few studies in mobile instant messaging (MIM).MIM is a quasi‐synchronous tool. It is difficult to transform the traditional external scaffolds (i.e., scripts or teachers' facilitation) which promote deep discussions from (a)synchronous forums to MIM. What this paper adds to this: We constructed a design framework which used learning analytical tools‐augmented meta‐discourse to engage students in shared epistemic agency discourse moves to promote their deep discussion in MIM.We conducted multiple types of analyses (content analysis, statistical analysis, epistemic network analysis and lag sequential analysis) on students' WeChat message (a major MIM in China).Results indicated both learning analytical tools helped engage students in shared epistemic agency discourse moves, such as creating shared understanding, creating knowledge objects, projective and regulative, thus, to promote students' deep discussions. Word cloud especially engaged students in more complete shared epistemic agency discourse trajectory. Moreover, analysis results indicated that shared epistemic agency discourse moves of creating shared understanding would lead students to a high level of deep discussions. Implications of study findings for practitioners: Our study provides a feasible way to educational practitioners who want to promote students' deep discussions in their online learning course (both fully online and flipped classroom mode).Knowledge Building Discourse Explorer (KBDeX presents the original analysis results of students' written messages in discussion forums as socio‐cognitive networks.) could be implemented in the classroom. The objective is to encourage students to understand the importance of connecting with peers' ideas in a one‐session implementation period.If time allows, teachers could use word cloud and meta‐discourse to engage students in socio‐metacognitive conversations in class to promote their shared epistemic agency discourse in online discussions.

        "Asynchronous online learning has grown in popularity due to its flexibility in providing higher education access to learners regardless of distance, transportation, and scheduling constraints. However, for successful online learning, students must adapt and intensify the self-regulated learning (SRL) skills they developed in face-to-face settings to the context of the online learning environment. SRL is the process by which students plan, complete learning activities, and evaluate their independent knowledge-building practice. Studies have associated higher education retention with SRL, suggesting the need for SRL-supportive features in online courses. However, current literature lacks universally applicable instructional design interventions to foster learners' SRL skills across disciplines. This study uses qualitative methods to investigate student perceptions of a reflective SRL intervention in an online biology course in a United States community college. The intervention included weekly self-reflection and post-exam goal-setting prompts followed by instructor feedback. Textual analysis of student reflections confirmed students' enactment of SRL during the intervention. Additionally, surveys and email interviews showed that students viewed the reflective intervention as a communication strategy and a means of receiving support from their instructor. This finding provided insight into the impact of the intervention on transactional distance. This study recommends reflective prompts as a beneficial practice in online courses and proposes further research to better understand the benefits of reflection on the learning process across educational disciplines. The easy-to-implement intervention is described for the consideration of other practitioners. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "The COVID-19 pandemic has popularized online learning as a mode of teaching and learning in universities, thereby exacerbating college students' stress levels in multiple ways. To enhance the quality of college student training, it is crucial to investigate the impact of perceived stress on their online self-directed learning. Using questionnaire data from 969 college students across China, this study performed an empirical analysis of the influence of perceived stress on their online self-directed learning, while also exploring the mediating role of phone dependence and the moderating role of self-management ability. The findings indicate that, firstly, perceived stress has a significant and positive effect on college students' online self-directed learning. Secondly, phone dependence masks the positive impact of perceived stress on students' self-directed learning, thereby weakening the effects of employment and learning stress on their online self-directed learning. Thirdly, self-management ability positively moderates the relationship between employment, social, interpersonal, and learning stress and college students' online self-directed learning. Fourthly, rural college students' online self-directed learning is more susceptible to employment, social, and interpersonal stress; vocational college students' self-directed learning is more influenced by employment, social, and learning stress; and students in the \"Double First-Class\" initiative universities are more likely to develop phone dependence. Therefore, this paper asserts that using stress reasonably, controlling stress appropriately, channeling stress properly, and enhancing self-management abilities can aid college students in learning autonomous online.

        "With the widespread implementation of COVID-19 prevention and control measures during the pandemic, online classes have become a normal and indispensable part of college students' lives. Analysis of the factors affecting college students' behavioural intention towards online classes will help improve online class quality. This paper sets up a model to analyse the factors that may affect such intentions. The results show that social influence, performance expectancy, effort expectancy, perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use have a significant positive effect on college students' behavioural intention, and enabling environment(i.e. the infeasibility of offline teaching due to the pandemic)has a significant negative effect on it. Gender and voluntariness, as moderator variables, also clearly influence behavioural intention. Based on pandemic prevention and control measures, along with education reform and modernisation, this paper offers valuable suggestions to online learning platform and education administrators.

        "Using gamification to support learning in K‐12 education has received much attention from scholars in recent years. However, there is still a lack of comprehensive understanding of how gamification should be used to effectively enhance the learning experiences of K‐12 students. The purpose of this review was to synthesize research findings on the use of gamification in K‐12 education and to propose an evidence‐informed framework. This framework will guide teachers and scholars in developing gamified learning environments that are effective in improving K‐12 students' learning. In this regard, 54 empirical studies (out of 907 peer‐reviewed articles), dating from 2008 through 2021, were reviewed using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐Analysis (PRISMA) guideline. The findings were systematically categorized into four essential dimensions of learning environments inspired by Biggs' 3P teaching and learning model, ie, 'individual factors', 'environmental factors', 'learning process' and 'learning outcome'. The review yielded rich findings concerning each dimension, providing K‐12 teachers and scholars with a comprehensive overview of research findings on using gamification for educational purposes. Meanwhile, the findings indicated the lack of empirical studies regarding constructively aligned gamified courses, in which the different dimensions of the adopted framework are implemented and evaluated coherently. The paper concludes by presenting several suggestions and directions for future research to address this shortcoming. Practitioner notesWhat is already known about this topic Gamification has demonstrated the potential to enhance learning outcomes in K‐12 education.There are instances where the findings suggest neutral or negative effects of gamification on students' learning outcomes.There is a lack of a comprehensive overview of empirical findings concerning the effectiveness of gamification in K‐12 education.What this paper adds The study highlights the potential of gamification in enhancing cognitive, affective and behavioural learning outcomes in K‐12 education, mainly by increasing motivation, engagement and competitiveness.The study provides a comprehensive overview of empirical studies on using gamification in K‐12 education.The study proposes an evidence‐informed framework that can serve as a blueprint for developing constructively aligned gamified learning environments for K‐12 education.Implications for practice and/or policy The study presents several up‐to‐date and empirically rooted calls for future research on using gamification in K‐12 education.The study makes evidence‐based recommendations for the effective integration of gamification in K‐12 education.

        "Background: Degree apprenticeships (DA) help employees gain new knowledge and skills by allowing them to study towards a university degree while working full time. For these programmes to be effective, the learning design should be adapted to the needs of these students, who are goal oriented (i.e. they want to gain only knowledge that can be applied within their workplace), have limited time for studying, and usually have not attended formal education for some time. As these programmes are relatively new, there is limited research on how these students can be supported to achieve the programmes' learning goals by using information and communication technologies. Objectives: This paper aims to understand whether a learning design that combines game‐based learning with online flipped classrooms can engage DA students in their learning and help them develop their reflective skills. Methods: Two focus groups were conducted with DA students that study at a UK Business School towards gaining the Chartered Manager status. The focus groups recordings have been analysed using reflexive thematic analysis. Results and Conclusions: The three main themes, \"change can be helpful and challenging at the same time\", \"the ideal game\", and \"the effect of others\", show that DA students find game‐based learning and online flipped classrooms useful, with the right support. Simulation games can be more fulfilling to DA students than quiz games, even if they take more of their out‐of‐class time. In addition, instructors are advised to work more closely with diverse teams to enable students share their work experiences and learn from each other. Lay Description: What is already known about this topic?: Online flipped classrooms offer flexibility in learning, but instructors need to find solutions to challenges, like students' limited e‐learning readiness and lack of motivation.Game‐based learning has been found to facilitate learning in general, but there is a need to identify the specific circumstances (i.e. settings, gaming elements) under which it is effective.Degree apprenticeship students need more support with their learning compared to traditional university students, as they face additional challenges in terms of family life‐work balance and connecting their learning to their working experience. What this paper adds?: Game‐based learning can be useful to degree apprenticeship students providing that focuses on the application of knowledge and provides feedback.Despite facing challenges related to maintaining work‐study‐life balance, degree apprenticeship students are willing to complete the flipped classroom's out‐of‐class activities, if they see a clear benefit from doing so.Online group activities can be challenging for degree apprenticeship students, if they are not able to form teams with other learners that work for the same organisation. The implications of study findings for practitioners: Avoid quiz‐like games and select the ones that use real‐life scenarios for degree apprenticeship students to help them link their learning to their practice.Formative feedback should be provided by both the instructor and the game to motivate degree apprenticeship students to spend the additional time to complete the out‐of‐class activities.Students should be reminded frequently of the purpose of any new learning elements (e.g. learning analytics) as they may not have the time to explore them on their own.When forming student teams based on students' workplace is not possible, spend more time in each breakout room to facilitate the online group discussion and help students bring their different working experiences together.

        "Artificial intelligence (AI) literacy is at the top of the agenda for education today in developing learners' AI knowledge, skills, attitudes and values in the 21st century. However, there are few validated research instruments for educators to examine how secondary students develop and perceive their learning outcomes. After reviewing the literature on AI literacy questionnaires, we categorized the identified competencies in four dimensions: (1) affective learning (intrinsic motivation and self‐efficacy/confidence), (2) behavioural learning (behavioural commitment and collaboration), (3) cognitive learning (know and understand; apply, evaluate and create) and (4) ethical learning. Then, a 32‐item self‐reported questionnaire on AI literacy (AILQ) was developed and validated to measure students' literacy development in the four dimensions. The design and validation of AILQ were examined through theoretical review, expert judgement, interview, pilot study and first‐ and second‐order confirmatory factor analysis. This article reports the findings of a pilot study using a preliminary version of the AILQ among 363 secondary school students in Hong Kong to analyse the psychometric properties of the instrument. Results indicated a four‐factor structure of the AILQ and revealed good reliability and validity. The AILQ is recommended as a reliable measurement scale for assessing how secondary students foster their AI literacy and inform better instructional design based on the proposed affective, behavioural, cognitive and ethical (ABCE) learning framework. Practitioner notesWhat is already known about this topic AI literacy has drawn increasing attention in recent years and has been identified as an important digital literacy.Schools and universities around the world started to incorporate AI into their curriculum to foster young learners' AI literacy.Some studies have worked to design suitable measurement tools, especially questionnaires, to examine students' learning outcomes in AI learning programmes.What this paper adds Develops an AI literacy questionnaire (AILQ) to evaluate students' literacy development in terms of affective, behavioural, cognitive and ethical (ABCE) dimensions.Proposes a parsimonious model based on the ABCE framework and addresses a skill set of AI literacy.Implications for practice and/or policy Researchers are able to use the AILQ as a guide to measure students' AI literacy.Practitioners are able to use the AILQ to assess students' AI literacy development.

        "Artificial intelligence (AI) will be in the future lives of children at school today. Voice-activated intelligent personal assistant devices are used in the home and could be useful in the classroom. This article explores how two groups of New Zealand children aged 7–12 engaged with Google Home devices in their classroom. Interactions recorded through the devices were analysed to evaluate how the devices were used, how easy they were to use and how the use aligns with the purposes of education. A framework for analysis was developed from Davis's Technology Acceptance Model and Biesta's three functions of education. The children used the devices across the three functions of education. They anthropomorphised the device, talking respectfully, sharing jokes and asking for its opinion. Use was influenced by the social context of the classroom and teacher beliefs about education, and limited as the devices were not designed for the classroom. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "The nature of education has been transformed by technological advances and online learning platforms, providing educational institutions with more options than ever to thrive in a complex and competitive environment. However, they still face challenges such as academic underachievement, graduation delays, and student dropouts. Fortunately, by harnessing student data from institution databases and online platforms, it becomes possible to predict the academic performance of individual students at an early stage. In this study, we utilized knowledge graphs (KG), clustering, and machine learning (ML) techniques on data related to students in the College of Information Technology at UAEU. To construct knowledge graphs and visualize students' performance at various checkpoints, we employed Neo4j-a high-performance NoSQL graph database. The findings demonstrate that incorporating clustered knowledge graphs with machine learning reduces predictive errors, enhances classification accuracy, and effectively identifies students at risk of course failure. Additionally, the utilization of visualization methods facilitates communication and decision-making within educational institutions. The combination of KGs and ML empowers course instructors to rank students and provide personalized learning interventions based on individual performance and capabilities, allowing them to develop tailored remedial actions for at-risk students according to their unique profiles.

        "The importance of \"willingness to communicate\" (WTC) in foreign language learning has been widely discussed. However, the current research on WTC mainly focuses on traditional classrooms, and there is insufficient attention to WTC in L3 online learning. This study explored the psychological process among motivation, WTC, foreign language enjoyment (FLE), foreign language classroom anxiety (FLCA), and perceived positive language interaction (PPLI). Based on data collected from 492 college students who were taking the online L3 course, results showed that: (1) L3 learners were somewhat willing to use L3 for communicating in online classes; (2) motivation was positively related to WTC; (3) FLE and FLCA mediated the relationship between motivation and WTC differently; (4) PPLI had moderating effects on both the relationship between FLE and WTC and between FLCA and WTC. Implications of online foreign language learning were discussed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "Artificial Intelligence (AI) has triggered profound reforms across industries, including education. These developments necessitate the inclusion of AI as a subject in K-12 classrooms. However, the need for students to learn AI demands that educators pay increasing attention, believe in its relevance and intend to promote it among their students and colleagues. This paper aimed to explore teachers' perceptions of and behavioral intention to teach AI. We specifically considered the association of AI anxiety, perceived usefulness, attitude towards AI, AI relevance, AI readiness, and behavioral intention factors. This research further aims to examine the moderator effect of AI for social good and confidence on the relationship in our hypothesized research model. To address this purpose, a quantitative methodology with the use of structural equation modeling was utilized. Data were retrieved through an online questionnaire from 320 lower and upper secondary school in-service teachers, mostly in STEM-related fields. Our findings reveal that teacher perceptions of AI for social good and confidence will affect most relationships in the model. Teacher professional programs should include the benefits and risks of AI and good practice sharing. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "Background: Game‐based learning can frame problem‐solving as a sense‐making experience with domain‐specific tasks for school students. However, multiple challenges arise when trying to support learners in such a complex, problem‐oriented learning environment. Objectives and Methods: With an architecture‐themed mathematics learning game, we conducted two mixed‐method studies to explore the impact and design of game‐based mathematical experience on the math problem‐solving performance of middle school students. Results and Conclusions: The study findings suggested a positive impact of game‐based math experience on math problem‐solving for middle school students. Problematization‐oriented game‐based math tasks with structuring features enhanced students' reasoning with problems and channelled it to doing mathematics. Takeaways: The current research findings support the initiative to frame learning as a sense‐making experience with domain‐specific tasks and inform the design of game‐based mathematical experience and learning support. Lay Description: What is already known about this topic: Realistic mathematical practices frame learning as a sense‐making experience.Challenges arise when involving learners in realistic mathematical experiences driven by domain‐specific tasks. What this paper adds: Game‐based simulation of math tasks framed learning as sense‐making experience.Game‐based math experiencing promoted math contextual problem‐solving performance.Structuring features enhanced problematized experiencing with math tasks. Implications for practice and/or policy: Teachers can integrate and facilitate game‐based math experiencing in class.Efforts should be made to make game‐based math tasks meaningful for students.

        "Under the current information technology development and social interaction digitalization, China shows an increasing interest in the possibilities of digital solutions improving the effectiveness of pedagogical processes when forming and developing sports competencies and skills in football players. The present article is devoted to the study of the influence of a digital game-based learning environment on the development of young football players' tactical thinking skills, football interest, and motivation to play it. The study offers an innovative football training model based upon the synergy of virtual (eFootball PES 2021 and SkillShare platforms) and real experiences. Testing of the developed model was carried out on the example of young football players (10–12 years) studying at the X sports school. The conducted educational experiment revealed the benefits of introducing game simulation in football training. The experiment results showed that game simulation and group participation in virtual football matches in eFootball PES 2021 helped master basic football techniques, facilitated the acquisition of competitive experience, fostered a culture of teamwork and camaraderie, and contributed to the rise of conscientiousness and self-discipline.

        "Although digital technology is an important part of young people's lives, previous research implies that they have a limited understanding of what programming is and its connection to the digital devices they encounter every day. In order to create conditions for meaningful teaching in and about programming in technology education, more knowledge about younger students' pre-understanding and experiences is needed. In the light of this, the aim of this case study was to explore young pupils' descriptions of the concept 'programming', in connection with being introduced to programming as a teaching content in technology education. The study is based on semi-structured interviews with 16 children in year 1 (7-year-olds) in a primary school in Sweden. In their descriptions of 'programming' as an activity, the pupils mainly used technological descriptions—a theory of artificial mind perspective. However, when they talked about the objects with which they associated programming, psychological descriptions—a theory of mind perspective—were more clearly present. Then, a less pronounced distinction between humans and machines was made. Anthropomorphic references were used, such as when the pupils referenced children's culture such as movies and television programs. However, the term 'programming' was difficult for many of the pupils to grasp. They also had difficulty in finding a function for programming, as well as explanations and arguments for why they learn programming in school. The results of this study indicate that these 7-year-old pupils perceive 'programming' as something complex. This at the same time as they describe how programmed and programmed artefacts (including AI devices) are highly present in their everyday lives, in their leisure environments, and in school. This mirrors how technology has become an 'intelligent' and active agent, rather than a mere tool in their lives—an aspect that teachers may forget to take advantage of. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "High attrition/dropout rates and low engagement have been major concerns of online educators. This study examined female high school students' cognitive engagement and disengagement in an online learning context during the COVID‐19 pandemic through the lens of self‐determination theory's basic psychological needs. We investigated an extended dual‐process motivation mediation model that emphasizes the mediating role of the need for competence, including an additional factor, technology self‐efficacy, in a South Korean high school context (n = 235). Results from structural equation modelling provided evidence for the proposed model. Our findings indicated that the exogenous variables (ie, perceived autonomy support, perceived teacher control and technology self‐efficacy) predicted cognitive engagement and disengagement with the mediating role of competence need satisfaction and competence need frustration. We found distinct processes including (a) \"autonomy support‐competence need satisfaction‐cognitive engagement\", (b) \"teacher control‐competence need frustration‐cognitive disengagement\", (c) \"technology self‐efficacy‐competence need satisfaction‐cognitive engagement\" and (d) \"technology self‐efficacy‐competence need frustration (negative effect)‐cognitive disengagement\". This study suggests using autonomy support strategies to fulfil students' competence needs in online learning contexts. We also found a possible role of technology self‐efficacy in influencing psychological competence needs, cognitive engagement and cognitive disengagement in online learning contexts. Implications of the findings are discussed. Practitioner notesWhat is already known about this topic High attrition/dropout rates and low engagement have been major concerns of online educators.Emergency remote teaching (ERT) has implications for online teaching beyond the ERT paradigm.Self‐determination theory (SDT) has been adopted and adapted with the goal of determining how to achieve need satisfaction, optimize learner motivation and enhance student engagement in classroom settings.What this paper adds This study applied a dual‐process motivation mediation model to investigate both cognitive engagement and disengagement among female high school students in an ERT online learning environment.The extended dual‐process motivation mediation model examined the role of an additional factor, technology self‐efficacy in cognitive engagement and disengagement in online learning.This study examined the role of direct, indirect and cross‐over effects focusing on both bright and dark aspects of the dual‐process motivation mediation model in online learning in a South Korean girls' high school during ERT.Implications for practice and/or policy This study proposes the use of autonomy support strategies in online learning contexts.Teachers should understand their students and provide support that addresses competence need satisfaction to enhance student cognitive engagement in online learning contexts.More efforts should be made to prepare teachers for designing online learning experiences that increase students' competence need satisfaction and decrease competence need frustration.

        "Background: Students often show unfavourable attribution: they attribute poor school performance to stable factors such as lack of ability and good school performance to variable factors such as effort. However, attribution can be influenced by individualized digital re‐attributional feedback leading to positive motivational effects and higher learning outcomes. This is very promising, but it still is unclear, whether this digital re‐attributional feedback can also be successfully integrated in everyday classroom activities. Objectives: The present field experiment investigated how integrating digital re‐attributional feedback into classroom instruction affects student attribution, motivation and learning outcomes. Methods: In the experiment, 8th–10th grade high school students (N = 322) worked with a digital mathematics learning program which was integrated in a three‐week teaching unit. Half the students in each classroom received only standard feedback after each practice task (SF group); the other half received additionally an individual re‐attributional feedback (RF group) after every third task. Attribution, mathematics self‐concept, and self‐efficacy were measured by an online questionnaire twice a week; learning outcomes in mathematics were measured weekly. Results and Conclusion: Hierarchical analyses showed that re‐attributional feedback led to a more favourable attribution in case of success on stable factors. Especially low‐performing students benefited from this feedback. No effects on attribution in case of failure, self‐efficacy or learning outcomes could be found. Further research could investigate if certain adaptations to the digital re‐attributional feedback is more effective in a real classroom setting and has a broader impact on different students. Lay Description: What is already known about this topic: Working with computers in the classroom and at home is becoming more common.Re‐attributional feedback can increase student's motivation when given directly after solving a task and at a high density.Digital re‐attributive feedback can be given in a high density.Re‐attributional training sessions have been shown to be effective in individual training sessions or outside the students' classroom. What this paper adds: The study took place within a real teaching environment during mathematics class for 4 weeks.Digital re‐attributional feedback sessions were directly integrated into the students' online learning which was part of the teaching plan. The implications of study findings for practitioners: Computer‐based re‐attributional training show some limited effects in regular classroom instruction and could be well integrated in student online learning—when adapted accordingly.Low‐performing students show less favourable attribution than better‐performing students in case of success and benefit the most from re‐attributional training.

        "Engagement with video games can potentially advance student digital competence however, there is a digital skills gap by the time young people progress into adolescence. This current research explores how elementary school students' digital self-efficacy might relate to experiences in video game environments to influence perceptions of digital competence. We examine the differential impact of sex, self-efficacy, and socioeconomic status (SES) on 7–10-year-old students' (N = 613) perceptions of video gaming and their digital skills. Analysis revealed the unexpected finding that SES was inversely related to enjoyment for gaming and digital technology, with students in the lower-SES category responding more positively compared to students in higher SES categories. As expected, boys self-reported digital skills higher than girls across all SES categories. We argue for the use of gaming pedagogies to support learning in classrooms that accounts for nuances in students' digital self-efficacy moderated by gender and SES. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "The use of makerspaces in Norwegian compulsory education is growing. However, using makercentred learning to support creativity has yet to be examined extensively in the Norwegian context. Consequently, the aim of this research is to explore Norwegian makerspace teachers' conceptions of the use of maker-centred learning to augment creative capabilities and digital competences. The study focuses on teachers' understandings of creativity and makerspaces along with various aspects of maker-centred learning and how they support creativity. The data was collected via six semi-structured interviews with teachers working in school-based makerspaces. In the interviews, the teachers conceptualised creativity related to makerspaces and reflected on various pedagogical aspects of managing creative makerspace activities. The research indicates that teachers have similar understandings of makerspaces but different interpretations of creativity. As a result, the makerspaces are designed differently, and the teachers use a variety of teaching methods. The findings also indicate that the teacher must be able to change their role from being an instructor to a facilitator and observer while also managing the utilised technology. Digital technology, collaboration, and constraints were also found to be factors that supported students' creativity. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "The impact of digital technology on the younger generation is profound and far-reaching. In a digital home environment, parental mediation of children's access to the Internet, digital devices, and their device use will either directly or indirectly affect children's digital attitudes and behaviors. Based on the ecological techno-microsystem theory, this study aims to examine the influence of parental mediation of Internet use and smartphone interference on children's Internet literacy and problematic smartphone use. A cross-sectional study was conducted in China and the data of 2465 elementary school students (mean age = 10.43 years, SD = 0.99, 47% girls) and their parents were collected through online and offline surveys. Structural equation model analysis indicated that parental mediation of Internet use reported by children was positively associated with children's Internet literacy (both self-regulation and reflection and critical analysis) while negatively associated with problematic smartphone use. Besides, parental smartphone interference reported by children was positively related to their reflection and critical analysis and problematic smartphone use. We also observed that children's self-regulation negatively predicted their problematic smartphone use. Further analysis showed notable discrepancies between what parents report and what children perceive. Additionally, the consistency between how parents mediate children's Internet use and how parents manage their smartphone usage has a complex influence on children's digital attitudes and behaviors. Current findings contribute to expanding our understanding of the important role of parents in a digital home and could further provide some practical guidance for parents to manage their children's digital use.

        "Teaching and learning in higher education is informed by a multitude of conditioning factors, not least the values systems and outlook of academics. Understanding the epistemological positioning taken by academics in relation to teaching and learning is therefore important if we are to make judgments about how we educate now, and could do so in the future. Developments in educational theory and digital technology have opened-up new possibilities for the ways in which students learn, and to a degree this has been accelerated by the responses from universities to the COVID-19 pandemic. How then should we conceive the future? Heutagogy is one of a number of theoretical approaches that has attracted interest from those who wish to see greater student control over the learning journey- but how widespread is this view amongst academics? This paper reports on a qualitative study in which 12 academics in an English Business School were asked to describe their views on teaching and learning, which we can encapsulate through the concept of epistemic cognition. The findings infer that there is little epistemological underpinning for heutagogy and that if academics are going to innovate, then additional resource and professional development should be put in place to support epistemic reflexivity, and a shift in their epistemological positioning. The paper conceptualises academics' positioning through a typology of epistemic views. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "This article discusses a study conducted among final-year undergraduate students preparing to become primary school teachers. These students participated in an eight-week module on digital technology, working in pairs to create, test and analyse pedagogical scenarios using and not using digital tablets. The study aimed to address two main questions: (1) How do the views of pre-service teachers change as a result of a technology instruction programme? (2) What new professional tasks emerge when they use digital technologies in their internship teaching practices? Various data sources were collected and analysed. The findings revealed that none of the pre-service teachers held entirely negative views on digital technologies after the module. They became more comfortable using them in their classrooms, especially for teaching oral language, while for mathematics they found them less useful. Furthermore, the results showed that eight new professional tasks appeared when teaching with digital technologies. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "Data from a sample of teachers, parents and pupils in Northern Ireland about their experiences of blended and online learning during the pandemic has thrown light on effective practice and some of the reasons for this. After an initial period of uncertainty and confusion, most of the five schools studied found ways to provide regular online lessons which in many cases had high levels of interaction between teachers and pupils and in some cases between pupils. This was true also in schools which had high levels of pupil disadvantage measured through entitlement to free school meals. The reasons for the emergence of good practice were the prior investment in ICT facilities for every school, the support provided through educational authorities and local teacher networks, and the quality of leadership in schools.

        "Background: Given students' lack of self‐directed learning skills and the growing concern about implementing massive online open courses (MOOCs) in K12 education, learning strategies are needed to facilitate MOOC learning. Many studies have provided different strategies for effective learning in MOOCs. However, there is still limited research to confirm whether these strategies effectively support MOOC learning when deployed by secondary schools, which are not MOOC developers. Objectives: This mixed‐method study examines the provision of different learning strategies, including a learning guide, an academic mentoring programme, a training workshop, and a reimbursement scheme, and investigates the impact of these strategies on student learning in MOOCs. Methods: The study uses two data sources: (1) surveys with 40 participants and (2) semi‐structured interviews with 12 participants. The quantitative data were analysed with descriptive statistics and Fisher's exact test, and the qualitative data were analysed with thematic analysis. Results and Conclusion: The findings indicate that MOOC learners had positive attitudes towards the overall school support, with mentoring enjoying great popularity amongst the students. In terms of the effectiveness of the school support, the mentoring programme and reimbursement scheme were more effective than the university training and learning guide. The paper discusses the implications for researchers and educators. Lay Description: What is already known about this topic: There are a large number of K12 MOOC implementations, which are (i) STEM‐related and computer science courses, and (ii) from Europe and the USA.Limited studies provided different learning strategies for MOOC learning from the perspective of K12 schools, which are not MOOC developers.There is a need to explore MOOC initiatives encompassing a wide variety of subjects, including computer science MOOCs and non‐computer science MOOCs, in regions beyond Europe and the USA.There is also a need for further scrutiny of the effectiveness of learning strategies provided by the K12 school. What this paper adds: Our study launched the first MOOC implementation in K12, encompassing several subject areas beyond computer science in the region of Asia.Our study provided different learning strategies adopted by the K12 school, and the analysis revealed that MOOC learners took positive attitudes towards overall school support with mentoring enjoying great popularity with these students.Our study examined the effectiveness of school support and identified that mentoring and reimbursement are more effective than university training and the learning guide. Implications for practitioners: The insights gained from the study enable other K12 schools and educators to implement MOOC into existing school infrastructures successfully.These strategies provided in the MOOC implementation program can be helpful in many different online learning contexts.

        "Foreign language teachers' management of their emotional expression has a significant impact on their classroom teaching and professional development. As the demand for online education continues to grow, researchers are increasingly paying attention to the emotional situations of teachers in online teaching. However, there has been minimal research on secondary school English as a foreign language (EFL) teachers, particularly during the COVID‐19 pandemic when online teaching became the norm. By combining two lines of investigation, namely, emotional labour and emotion regulation, this study aimed to explore the emotional labour of EFL teachers in online teaching during the pandemic. As a qualitative case study, this research recruited 12 secondary school EFL teachers as participants. Drawing from semi‐structured interviews and reflective journals, this paper revealed the nuanced dilemma of EFL teachers' emotional labour, the emotional rules they followed and the emotional regulation strategies they applied in their online teaching. This study also explored the complexity of the online learning environment in relation to EFL teachers' emotional labour and analysed the characteristics of teachers' emotional labour in online teaching compared to face‐to‐face classroom teaching. The findings confirmed that the change in the teaching situation affected teachers' emotional labour and underlined the importance of self‐emotional management. At the end, this paper called for more attention to the emotional demands of online teaching to cultivate an emotionally healthy environment for EFL teachers. (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",
        "摘要: 外语教师情绪调节对课堂教学和专业发展有着重要影响。随着在线教育需求的日益增长, 在线教学中教师情绪状况逐渐引起了研究者们的关注。但是, 英语作为外语的中学教师情绪劳动研究还不多, 尤其是在新冠肺炎疫情期间, 在线教学已成为常态情况下的相关研究就更为稀少。本研究以12名中学英语教师作为研究对象进行了个案研究, 尝试将情绪劳动和情绪调节相结合, 探讨新冠疫情期间英语教师在线教学中的情绪劳动。基于对教师的半结构化访谈和反思日志, 揭示了英语教师情绪劳动的困境、情绪规律以及他们在网络教学中的情绪调节策略。本研究还探讨了在线教学环境下英语教师情绪劳动的复杂性, 比较了在线教学与课堂教学中教师情绪劳动的特点。研究结果表明, 教学环境的变化影响了教师的情绪劳动, 凸显了自我情绪管理的重要性。本研究建议更多地关注在线教学中的教师情感需求, 为英语教师营造一个健康的情绪环境。 (Chinese) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "In the form of distance, video broadcast interactive courses, rural distance video classes enable rural schools with struggling art education teachers to share high-quality art education resources retrieved from urban-area schools. This study aims to investigate and explore teaching strategies that effectively enhance pupils' concentration in distance music classes. The descriptive survey method was employed to collect, analyze, and interpret the data to meet the study's objectives. Students' (N = 45) behavior in thirteen (13) distance music classes in Changsha County China was tracked and observed, and two rural school assistant teachers (N = 2) were interviewed. Text data recorded from observations and interviews were analyzed and categorized qualitatively. The research results indicated that the visual and audio support, incorporation of music games, and progressive learning of rhythms et al. can effectively improve students' concentration in distance music classes. The article also suggests: (1) conducting clear and engaging classroom tasks; (2) mixing body rhythm participation; (3) building a harmonious teacher-student relationship; (4) creating sustainable online learning environments; and (5) utilizing ChatGPT assistance in future distance music teaching practice.

        "Educational Technology (EdTech) plays a significant role in enabling learners with disabilities to access learning at school and reduce educational and social exclusion. It also enables them to enjoy the benefits of a full school curriculum and to participate in activities in different educational arrangements. The purpose of this review was to address the existing evidence of how EdTech is being used to support learners with disabilities in order to inform future research and policymaking. It sought to contribute to an evidence base of ways to reduce barriers to learning drawing on a systematic methodology to gather evidence pertaining to access to EdTech for primary school learners with disabilities aged 6–12 years. After a thorough examination of the literature, the final sample comprised 51 published articles (43 peer-review and 8 conference papers). The review revealed examples of positive outcomes of EdTech interventions being used, particularly in special schools; however, the evidence of their efficacy is weak. The use of EdTech for learners with disabilities in low- and middle-income countries requires further, robust and long-term research that considers the involvement of learners, pedagogy and curriculum design in order to understand its impact on improving educational experiences of children with disabilities.

        "Background: This research paper presents a cross‐sectional study that examinefs the preferences of students for hybrid teaching and learning scenarios. Unlike previous studies that merely describe hybrid scenarios, this research prioritizes them, offering evidence‐based findings for informed policy decisions. Methods: The data collection method involved eight choice‐based tasks using the conjoint analysis technique conducted with 'Sawtooth' software. The study surveyed students at a mid‐sized university across four departments in Central Switzerland. The sample analysed in this article comprised 319 respondents from the Lucerne School of Business. Results and Conclusions: Our survey found that students' own location during a teaching session played a significant role in determining participation preferences, followed by that of the lecturer. Factors that influenced students' preferences whether to attend onsite or online include workload, didactical format, perceived level of difficulty, student residence, and semester. Forms of hybrid collaboration and student–student interaction did not significantly influence student preferences. Takeaways: The value of this study lies in its evidence‐based findings for specific hybrid scenarios, which can provide useful insights for policymakers in degree programs and faculty in hybrid classrooms. This study is one of only a few to use conjoint analysis with such a high respondent rate to determine student preferences for hybrid attendance. Lay Description: What is currently known about this topic?: Student demand for hybrid teaching scenarios remains high, while many faculty find the scenario technically challenging.Opinions as to the precise features of 'hybrid' vary widely.No clear understanding of the conditions under which students will decide to attend any given class.Demand for additional exchange among online students is recommended in the literature, but often not implemented. What does this paper add?: The study uses conjoint analysis to simulate how students make attendance decisions.The study shows empirically which factors are most important to determine students' attendance.Two‐thirds of the students surveyed prefer an online option.Group composition and informal exchange do not significantly impact students' attendance preferences. Implications for practice/or policy: Students appreciate the flexibility of online learning but expect lecturers to be onsite.Difficult subjects are more likely to be attended onsite.Student residence, workload, degree program, and semester impact students' attendance preferences.No additional infrastructure is needed to encourage exchange among students.

        "This paper provides an experience report on a co‐design approach with teachers to co‐create learning analytics‐based technology to support problem‐based learning in middle school science classrooms. We have mapped out a workflow for such applications and developed design narratives to investigate the implementation, modifications and temporal roles of the participants in the design process. Our results provide precedent knowledge on co‐designing with experienced and novice teachers and co‐constructing actionable insight that can help teachers engage more effectively with their students' learning and problem‐solving processes during classroom PBL implementations. Practitioner notesWhat is already known about this topic Success of educational technology depends in large part on the technology's alignment with teachers' goals for their students, teaching strategies and classroom context.Teacher and researcher co‐design of educational technology and supporting curricula has proven to be an effective way for integrating teacher insight and supporting their implementation needs.Co‐designing learning analytics and support technologies with teachers is difficult due to differences in design and development goals, workplace norms, and AI‐literacy and learning analytics background of teachers.What this paper adds We provide a co‐design workflow for middle school teachers that centres on co‐designing and developing actionable insights to support problem‐based learning (PBL) by systematic development of responsive teaching practices using AI‐generated learning analytics.We adapt established human‐computer interaction (HCI) methods to tackle the complex task of classroom PBL implementation, working with experienced and novice teachers to create a learning analytics dashboard for a PBL curriculum.We demonstrate researcher and teacher roles and needs in ensuring co‐design collaboration and the co‐construction of actionable insight to support middle school PBL.Implications for practice and/or policy Learning analytics researchers will be able to use the workflow as a tool to support their PBL co‐design processes.Learning analytics researchers will be able to apply adapted HCI methods for effective co‐design processes.Co‐design teams will be able to pre‐emptively prepare for the difficulties and needs of teachers when integrating middle school teacher feedback during the co‐design process in support of PBL technologies.

        "Information and communications technology (ICT) is now widely used in education. However, the effect of ICT on the development of students' scientific higher-order thinking skills (S-HOTS) is a controversial issue in science education research. This has attracted significant attention from researchers worldwide in the field of educational technology. In this study, a novel framework for students' S-HOTS is proposed based on Marzano's new taxonomy to determine the impact of ICT on S-HOTS. And exploring the difference in the impact of ICT on S-HOTS in two different countries. The data for this study were obtained from the Science Assessment and ICT Familiarity Questionnaire of the PISA 2015 survey for Finnish and Chinese students. This survey measures the differences in economic and educational levels and literacy in each country and tests the knowledge and skills necessary for life in reading, mathematics, and science for students (15 years old), through a detailed pre-testing country field study to make the results comparable across countries. We used the Delphi methodology to determine the framework of S-HOTS and a regression analysis to analyse the effects of ICT on students' S-HOTS. The results demonstrate how the availability, use frequency and use time of ICT affect S-HOTS. Furthermore, we compared the results between China (9841 students) and Finland (2538 students), and these findings demonstrated that ICT use at school has a negative effect on S-HOTS, especially ICT use time in school. We also found that using an interactive whiteboard positively and significantly affects S-HOTS. The results suggest that the effect of ICT use on S-HOTS in school depends on the ICT method combined with the learning process. Consequently, the use of ICT in schools should be viewed dialectically to promote students' S-HOTS. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "This study explores the role of teachers' perceptions of digital personalised learning (DPL) tools in their intention to use and actual usage of these tools in the classroom. Utilizing the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), we address two gaps in the literature: the limited investigation of DPL in real-world settings and the reliance on self-report surveys to study TAM. We collaborated with 15 schools in Flanders (Belgium) to assess the i-Learn portal, a newly developed DPL tool. Our research objectives were to examine the relationships between teachers' perceptions of usefulness (PU), ease of use (PEU), behavioral intention to use (BI), and actual usage. We employed a mixed-method approach involving self-report surveys, focus group interviews, and log data analysis. Results indicate positive associations between PEU and PU, PU and BI, and BI and actual use based on survey data. However, there was no significant relationship between BI and actual use when measured through log data. Notably, a positive correlation was found between survey-based actual usage and actual usage as measured through log data. These findings emphasize the importance of considering actual usage data and qualitative interviews alongside self-reported data when evaluating DPL tools in large-scale projects. The study contributes to the alignment of future educational technology (EdTech) tools with teachers' perceptions and actual usage patterns. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "The closing of schools world-wide in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a rapid and unexpected shift from predominantly in-person teaching to online teaching practices. As teacher educators in the field of educational technology, we wondered about the preparedness of teachers for making the transition to fully online environments. Through an internationally distributed survey consisting of predominantly open-ended questions, we captured teachers' perceptions of this transition. We aimed to inform our practice and that of other teacher educators about the strengths and weaknesses of professional development designed to develop teachers' digital competence. In this paper, we present data from Norwegian (n = 574) and US (n = 239) teachers related to their elaborations on readiness. We qualitatively examined data for evidence of extent of preparedness and alignment to the pedagogical, ethical, attitudinal, and technical dimensions of digital competence. Findings indicated themes related to extent of preparedness, trends in preparation, focus on digital tools, teacher agency without autonomy, collaboration/networks, and challenges for work and learning lives. Findings informed implications and recommendations for the professional development of teachers' digital competence at the teacher education, K-12 schools, and school policy/leadership levels.

        "Background: Although human–robotic interaction is a rapidly burgeoning area of study within education, and social robots are being widely tested for use in schools, few studies have focused on early adolescent interactions with robots under actual classroom conditions. Objectives: We introduced an autonomous, social robot ('Pepper') into a project‐based learning environment at a public elementary/middle school in order to see how long‐term exposure to a robot in a project‐based classroom affected student conceptions of robots. Methods: We conducted unstructured classroom observations, focus‐group interviews with students, and took videos of students interacting with the robot at key points in the project. We engaged in joint coding and memo writing to summarize key themes. Results: Our results showed the limitations of these social robots as interactive educational technology, but also revealed the complexity of young adolescent beliefs about robots as social actors. Although current technology limits the ability of robots to be widely deployed in public‐school classrooms, skillfully designed interventions using social robots have the potential to motivate and engage students. Takeaways: Exposure to the robot stimulated students to discuss robots as social actors, raised issues about gender identification of artificial agents in the classroom, and stimulated discussion on what constitutes a social being. The initial novelty of the humanoid robot enhanced engagement with the longer‐term project and also challenged teachers to be more reflective and flexible in planning the project. Lay Description: What is already known about this topic: Social robots are increasingly being used in K‐12 classrooms.Robots are still a novelty for students, but technical limitations mean students rapidly lose interest.Some students appear to form emotional bonds with the robots or believe the robots can think and feel.Most of this research has been done under experimental conditions with younger children.We know little about how early adolescents react to robots under normal classroom conditions. What this paper adds: Using social robots in actual classrooms requires teachers to invest considerable time to learn about the technology and solve multiple implementation issues in order to keep up student engagement.The novelty of a social robot can greatly enhance student motivation to engage in long‐term, complex projects.Interacting with social robots stimulates young adolescents to discuss what aspects of the robot make them appear 'social'.Interacting with social robots stimulates young adolescents to consider whether or not robots are truly 'social beings'. Implications for practice and/or policy: The current generation of social robots is not suitable for most public school classrooms.Social robots have potential for project‐based or problem‐based classrooms as they pose complex problems that stimulate young adolescent thinking about social beings and social relations.

        "One of the important elements of teachers' technology integration is Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK). Though there are studies on TPACK, limited information exists about its context element. This gap causes context-isolated studies for TPACK-related research. The aim of this research is to elaborate on science teachers' technology-based lesson practices in terms of contextual factors influencing TPACK. The study participants consisted of 12 science teachers and 7 educational technologists by using snowball sampling. The case study design method was used in this study within the qualitative research paradigm. The data was collected with semi-structured interviews by following the protocol for strategic performance problems. The interviews were examined employing content analysis to reveal the themes. The findings of the study indicated that TPACK is not only a stand-alone knowledge and skills, but also it is context-oriented. The multifaceted factors represent components of a multi-layered structure of the context. These factors can be perceived by the teachers at different levels according to school types. Furthermore, sub-themes of the contextual factors showed complex interrelationships. This study contributes to the literature by revealing the sub-themes of the context and in-depth examination of contextual factors suggested for future studies. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "In response to the digital transformation in education, teachers are expected to develop new competencies. Although teachers gained valuable experience in digital technology use during the COVID-19 pandemic, research and practice show that primary school teachers need to be supported and trained for the new normal of innovative, advanced use and adoption of digital technologies in educational practice. This study aims to identify the key factors that influence teachers' motivation to transfer technology-enabled educational innovation in primary education. The Learning Transfer System Inventory (LTSI) factors and the adoption factors of technology-enabled educational innovation have been conceptually mapped. The LTSI model has been empirically validated with data collected from 12.7% of Lithuanian primary school teachers. The structural equation modeling technique was utilized to analyze causal relationships of factors influencing teachers' motivation to transfer technology-enabled educational innovation. The qualitative research method was used to provide a deeper understanding of key factors that influence motivation to transfer. The conducted analysis shows that motivation to transfer is significantly influenced by all five domains of factors: perceived value, personal characteristics, social practices, organizational and technology-enabled innovation factors. Motivation to transfer innovation varies according to teachers' perceived digital technology integration skills, which underpin the importance of applying different roles and strategies based on the teachers' skills. This study provides implications for designing effective professional development for in-service teachers and creating a suitable environment in schools for the adoption of innovation in post-COVID-19 education.

        "This special issue highlights research mainly conducted from 2020 to 2023 in Canada, France, Germany, the UK and Finland. Each of these studies presents the affordances and constraints of using multilingual digital tools to address the deficit orientation to the education of newcomer students that still exists in many contexts. This includes the underestimation of the potential of multilingual students as well as the exclusive focus on using the language of the school for teaching and learning. It highlights the crucial role of teachers in supporting newcomer students and emphasises the innovative nature of using digital technology in STEM education. The six articles that make up this special issue focus on linguistically and culturally relevant online learning resources and curricula designed to support inclusive learning in STEM subjects. Focusing on teachers and their ideologies as well as teacher training, the articles highlight the varying degrees of effectiveness of multilingual technology in providing new ways of integrating newcomer student perspectives into curricula and promoting inclusive STEM education.

        "This paper presents an interpretative phenomenological analysis study of students' experiences with ungrading in the form of reflection-based self-evaluation in a college course. In the landscape of student evaluation, ungrading strategies respond to the limitations of traditional grading systems, particularly with respect to cultivating in-demand skills and capacities, such as adaptability, creative thinking, and self-management. Through in-depth interviews with eight students, this study reports on four experiential themes that characterize the switch to ungrading: de-gamification, or unsettling the \"gamified\" nature of evaluation in the traditional grading system; time to think and reflect, creating space for review and the deepening of learning; rich communication, or continual feedback between teacher and student; and learning community, in which students felt like they were part of a team effort rather than siloed individuals. Considerations for further research, as well as implementation of ungrading in other courses, are discussed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "Moving beyond the direct support all alone by a human teacher or an Artificial Intelligence (AI) system, optimizing the complementary strengths of the two has aroused great expectations and educational innovation potential. Yet, the conceptual guidance of how best to structure and implement teacher-AI collaboration (TAC) while ensuring teachers' instructional roles to support students learning remains limited. This study, therefore, aims what (1) curriculum, (2) teacher-AI interaction, (3) learning environment would be required as well as how TAC would evolve by reflecting teachers' views. Through in-depth interviews with 20 Chinese leading teachers in AI in Education (AIED), the study found that teachers aimed to improve students' subject-matter knowledge and build their capacity as the desired goals for TAC and these can be carried out by data-driven problem-based learning and case-based reasoning in tandem with growth-focused and reflective assessment. While teachers highlighted that developing teachers' data literacy and collegiality with AI are essential, they expected AI to be equipped with Technological Pedagogical and Content Knowledge (TPACK) knowledge and conflict resolution skills. In addition, teachers expressed that Internet of Things (IoT)-based classrooms, systematic AIED curriculum, school-based continuing professional development, research-practice-policy partnerships as well as creating a continuous learning and AI-ready culture are significant. Furthermore, teachers envision TAC would develop into three stages: (1) teachers as passive AI recipients, (2) teachers as active AI users (3) teachers-AI as constructive partners. These findings build a more holistic and in-depth understanding of the AIED and offer implications for the educational AI design and teachers' education. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "Background: Gamification is a novel active methodology used in Physical Education to motivate students. Purpose: This study analyzed the impact of this method on the motivation of Compulsory Secondary Education students in Spain during an 8-session Physical Education Didactic Unit. Methods: A total of 275 students participated, divided into a gamified group (n = 133) and a control group (n = 142). The participants filled out 2 questionnaires, one aimed at assessing Basic Psychological Needs (BPNs) (Basic Psychological Needs in Exercise Scale) and the other at measuring the motivational component (The Sport Motivation Scale). Results: An interaction effect (Time x Treatment) was found, with the gamified group improving in BPNs (autonomy (F(1) 57.97, p = <0.001; η²p = 0.175); competence (F(1) 37.28, p = <0.001; η²p = 0.120); relatedness (F(1) 51.49, p = <0.001; η²p = 0.159), and intrinsic motivation (F(1) 39.65, p = <0.001; η²p = 0.127), while decreasing in amotivation (F(1) 21.42, p = <0.001; η²p = 0.073)). Conclusions: These data suggest that a gamified intervention enhances the satisfaction of the basic psychological needs, increases intrinsic motivation, while decreases amotivation in secondary education students.

        "This study explores the impact of screencast feedback on maths tests for junior and high school students. While prior research emphasises the influence of feedback on learning, its effectiveness varies with type and delivery. Although studies in higher education observe improved precision and emotional connections through screencast feedback, its applicability in secondary education remains understudied. The authors surveyed 99 students, collecting responses via an 11-item questionnaire after the students had received feedback. Through thematic analysis, they found 72% favoured video feedback due to its clarity, depth and personal touch. Conversely, 17% preferred written feedback for efficiency. These findings underscore the benefits of screencasting feedback, highlighting its comprehensibility and individualised nature. Given the rise of digital learning, educators are encouraged to adopt screencasting as a valuable tool for enhancing feedback in academic settings. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "With a strong demand for online education and project management in deeper scope and larger scale to better fit COVID-19 pandemic situation, exploring new knowledge of online education to make it more effective became vital with the new challenges of STEM education. To resolve the above problem, this paper focuses on various aspects of online STEM education project management where the Enhanced Noyce Explorers, Scholars, Teachers (E-NEST) three-tiered structure was implemented during the COVID-19 period. Two City University of New York (CUNY) institutions, New York City College of Technology (City Tech) and Borough of Manhattan Community College (BMCC) used the three-tiered structure referred to as Explorer, Scholar and Teacher which incorporated advancements in teaching internships, professional development workshops and mentorships remotely. Built upon the theories of engagement, capacity and continuity (ECC) and team-based learning (TBL), this remote learning model and infrastructure had a positive impact on STEM education and project management. The technological tools utilized included Zoom, Google Meet, Microsoft teams, Blackboard Collaborate Ultra, Skype and SurveyMonkey. The results from qualitative and quantitative data including project evaluation, online surveys and focus group interviews demonstrate that the modified remote learning and management tools were effective. This indicated that the E-NEST model greatly supported student success and faculty in online learning and project management meetings. The E-NEST STEM education project was compared to two other project management models along with the previous NEST curriculum. Faculty emphasized practicing project management proactively and utilized best practices of classroom and time management consistent with Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK) and Project Cycle Management (PCM) guidelines. The comparisons attest that the E-NEST project developed excellent and innovative online platforms for student learning with project management and ECC and TBL applications. Hereafter, this research can be used to constructively develop more online STEM education learning models and platforms and integrate new practice and technology globally. These ideas can contribute to future research that could be applied internationally to STEM education projects in K-12 and higher education institutions. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "Background: Social network awareness (SNA) enables students to know the online learning context of peers in computer‐supported collaborative learning (CSCL) and it has been used to improve peer interaction and participation in collaborative learning tasks. Mobile learning enables students to access learning content and discuss content with peers regardless of location or time. Because almost every college student has their own mobile device and social networks are ubiquitous in their daily lives, a mobile learning application with social networking is promising for promoting effective learning if students are willing to continually use the application. However, few studies have investigated this. Objectives: In this study, SNA was integrated into a mobile‐based assessment (MBA–SNA). The study investigated whether students were willing to persist in the use of MBA–SNA and the factors influencing this intention. Methods: A 1‐month experiment was conducted to investigate the research question on the basis of the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT). Results: The results demonstrated that (1) students were willing to continue using the MBA–SNA, (2) the incentives influencing behavioural intention (BI) in initial use and continual use differed, and (3) social influence (SI) and perceived playfulness (PP) were the two key determinants of continual use. Implications: The SNA increases the positive impact of SI and PP on MBA continual use so that continual use can be assured. Future research should integrate SNA into other mobile learning apps (e.g., mobile collaborative writing or discussion apps) to enhance continued system use and learning effectiveness. Lay Description: What is already known about this topic: A number of studies have investigated the use of mobile devices to collaborate digitally within small teams and larger classes whilst providing knowledge‐sharing features.Social network awareness (SNA) mechanism can enhance the participation of collaborative learning task and knowledge sharing.However, few research explores the potentials and benefits of the combination of SNA with mobile apps. What this paper adds: This study firstly integrates the SNA into a mobile collaborative APP, namely mobile‐based assessment with SNA (MBA‐SNA).Students are willing to continuously use the MBA‐SNA.The incentive factors influencing behavioural intention at the initial use and continuous use slightly differ.Social influence (SI) and perceived playfulness (PP) are the most crucial determinants to continuous use. Implications for practice and/or policy: It should be investigated whether students are willing to continuously use a new e‐learning system and the factors influencing this intention.SNA increased the effects of SI and PP on MBA continual use, thereby ensuring MBA continual use.Future studies can combine SNA with other mobile learning apps (e.g., mobile collaborative writing or discussion apps) to enhance continued system use and learning effectiveness.

        "During the pandemic, school and university students had to urgently move away from traditional classrooms to online learning in their homes. Student engagement that can be explained by self-determination theory (SDT) is important in online learning. Indeed, the founders of SDT recently stated that SDT-based future research should look closely at how to satisfy the basic needs in the theory in technology enhanced learning environments. We also know very little about K-12 student engagement in online learning. Therefore, this qualitative study used the SDT as a framework to understand K-12 school student engagement and disengagement in online learning. It used a thematic analysis to analyse interview data from 36 students and 18 teachers. The findings highlight that (i) online learning environments that supported more autonomy were more likely to engage students cognitively in developing two important lifelong skills of digital literacy and self-regulated learning; and (ii) those environments that lacked emotional attachment, equipment and resources, coupled with perceived digital incompetence and ineffective learning experience of the students suppressed cognitive and emotional engagement. Hence, this study suggests how to satisfy the need for competence and relatedness to prepare and implement online learning. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "A diagnosis of autism typically depends on clinical assessments by highly trained professionals. This high resource demand poses a challenge in low-resource settings. Digital assessment of neurodevelopmental symptoms by non-specialists provides a potential avenue to address this challenge. This cross-sectional case-control field study establishes proof of principle for such a digital assessment. We developed and tested an app, START, that can be administered by non-specialists to assess autism phenotypic domains (social, sensory, motor) through child performance and parent reports. N = 131 children (2–7 years old; 48 autistic, 43 intellectually disabled and 40 non-autistic typically developing) from low-resource settings in Delhi-NCR, India were assessed using START in home settings by non-specialist health workers. The two groups of children with neurodevelopmental disorders manifested lower social preference, greater sensory interest and lower fine-motor accuracy compared to their typically developing counterparts. Parent report further distinguished autistic from non-autistic children. Machine-learning analysis combining all START-derived measures demonstrated 78% classification accuracy for the three groups. Qualitative analysis of the interviews with health workers and families of the participants demonstrated high acceptability and feasibility of the app. These results provide feasibility, acceptability and proof of principle for START, and demonstrate the potential of a scalable, mobile tool for assessing neurodevelopmental conditions in low-resource settings. Autism is diagnosed by highly trained professionals– but most autistic people live in parts of the world that harbour few or no such autism specialists and little autism awareness. So many autistic people go undiagnosed, misdiagnosed, and misunderstood. We designed an app (START) to identify autism and related conditions in such places, in an attempt to address this global gap in access to specialists. START uses computerised games and activities for children and a questionnaire for parents to measure social, sensory, and motor skills. To check whether START can flag undiagnosed children likely to have neurodevelopmental conditions, we tested START with children whose diagnoses already were known: Non-specialist health workers with just a high-school education took START to family homes in poor neighbourhoods of Delhi, India to work with 131 two-to-seven-year-olds. Differences between typically and atypically developing children were highlighted in all three types of skills that START assesses: children with neurodevelopmental conditions preferred looking at geometric patterns rather than social scenes, were fascinated by predictable, repetitive sensory stimuli, and had more trouble with precise hand movements. Parents' responses to surveys further distinguished autistic from non-autistic children. An artificial-intelligence technique combining all these measures demonstrated that START can fairly accurately flag atypically developing children. Health workers and families endorsed START as attractive to most children, understandable to health workers, and adaptable within sometimes chaotic home and family environments. This study provides a proof of principle for START in digital screening of autism and related conditions in community settings. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "The purpose of this study is multifold: First, to develop an educational program using artificial intelligence (AI) in middle school free semester system of South Korea. Second, to verify the program's effectiveness, the study clarified the definition of AI and AI education and considered their meaning in technology education. This study used three steps: preparation, development, and improvement. In the preparation step, this study set the theme and purpose of the AI program and selected the free semester activity type \"theme selection activity.\" After analyzing the technology curriculum and extracting AI-related elements in the development step, this study laid out the program for 16 h of class time. In the improvement step, to augment the program's validity, the researcher revised and supplemented it as a whole through expert consultation. This research differentiated the developed program from the AI education program of other subjects and specialized it, focusing on the specificity of technology education. The study emphasized the social impact of the latest technology, ethics of AI, physical computing using AI, and technological problem-solving activity using AI. The final developed program was applied to the students, and students participated in a pretest and posttest. The study used the PATT and AI competency test tools. The PATT results showed a significant increase in the mean of both constructs in \"interest in technology\" and \"career aspirations in technology.\" In AI competency, the mean of two constructs increased significantly in \"social impact of AI\" and \"AI performance.\" In particular, \"AI performance\" showed the largest increase. There was no statistically significant change in \"interaction with AI.\" The study results confirmed that the developed AI program was effective in technology education and career exploration, which is the primary purpose of the free semester. In addition, it was possible to confirm the technology educational value of the AI education program centered on technological problem-solving. These research results have implications for bringing AI into technology education. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "Background: Measurement of students' self‐regulation skills is an active topic in education research, as effective assessment helps devising support interventions to foster academic achievement. Measures based on event tracing usually require large amounts of data (e.g., MOOCs and large courses), while aptitude measures are often qualitative and need careful interpretation. Precise and interpretable evaluation of self‐regulation skills in a normal K‐12 classroom thus poses a challenge. Objectives: The present study proposes and explores a learning analytics method of combining aptitude and event measures to evaluate student's self‐regulation skills. Methods: An explorative learning analytics study was conducted in a junior high school mathematics class (N=20 students), using a three‐lesson intervention with digital learning materials. Students first assessed their self‐regulation skills with a self‐report questionnaire, after which trace logs and observations of student behaviour were collected. Learning sessions were extracted from trace logs, clustered, and linked to learning strategies. Students were clustered by the self‐report results and learning behaviour profiles. Session clusters, student behaviour clusters and assignment grades were also tested for association. Results and Conclusions: The detected session and student behaviour types were linked to learning tactics and strategies found in prior studies. Additionally, association was found between self‐reported self‐regulation skills and the student behaviour obtained from trace logs. Implications: The results demonstrate the feasibility of concurrently using aptitude and event measures on a classroom scale, providing teachers with a tool to evaluate and support self‐regulated learning. Combined with further measures like predictive learning analytics, teachers can obtain an early and highly interpretable picture of at‐risk students in their classes. Lay Description: What is already known about this topic: Active monitoring of self‐regulated learning skills is primarily standard in large courses and MOOCs.Aptitude measures for self‐regulated learning are commonplace but considered subjective.Event measures for self‐regulated learning are precise but require additional interpretation to link behaviour to learning.Prior studies demonstrated approaches to analysing student behaviour from trace logs. What this paper adds: Both measure types can be used to monitor student behaviour in a classroom actively over a low number of sessions.Event and aptitude measures complement each other by exposing discrepancies between students' behaviours and actions.Measuring self‐regulated learning actively in class can yield valuable information to select appropriate interventions. Implications for practice: Integrating aptitude and event measures in digital learning materials gives teachers quickly actionable information about student behaviour.Approaches to integrating learning analytics for self‐regulated learning in digital learning materials should be further developed.Data‐informed choice of self‐regulated learning interventions should be explored further.

        "Health education aims to change unhealthy behaviors and promote population health. However, limited teaching time and standardized materials pose challenges, prompting elementary school teachers to explore technology-enhanced teaching strategies. To cultivate proper health attitudes and behaviors among elementary school students, many researchers have widely used e-books to teach health education-related courses. Many studies have proven interactive e-books to be effective in aiding both teaching and learning. However, despite the continuous innovation of e-books in educational applications, the long-term effects of e-books have yet to be investigated, since learning memory only responds to short-term memory effects. Therefore, this study attempts to develop a sequential multi-level prompting strategy for e-book learning in a mobile learning environment for tablet computers. Students from two primary school classes were recruited for the empirical study. The experimental group used a sequential multi-level, prompting-based e-book to learn, while the control group used a conventional e-book learning approach. According to the study's results, the proposed learning strategies were found to improve the learning achievement of primary school students for cardiovascular disease, guide students in building knowledge, develop thinking and problem-solving skills, and help students transform their learning from short-term to long-term memory through post-testing of problem-solving delays. It is certain that sequential multi-level prompting strategies can help younger learners better understand and remember learning content and apply the knowledge they have gained to develop correct health attitudes.

        "After the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, schools had to continuously adapt to new pandemic-related regulations and challenges, including the ad hoc transition to remote learning. According to theories on school improvement and professionalisation, sharing knowledge and experiences with digital learning is helpful when dealing with related issues. However, no existing empirical studies analyse longitudinally how pre-pandemic experiences with sharing knowledge and digital learning impacted perceived professionalisation during the pandemic and how this relationship is mediated both by schools' strategies to improve learning and by schools' collective efficacy. For this study N = 280 school principals from Germany, Austria, and German-speaking Swiss cantons participated in two online questionnaires in 2020 and 2021. Results from the structural equation model reveal that schools' pre-pandemic experiences with knowledge sharing and digital learning are positively indirectly related to the schools' perceived professionalisation in the first and second year of the pandemic. The relationship is mediated by the schools' collective efficacy in dealing with the pandemic and the schools' use of strategies to improve teaching. The results highlight the importance of building school improvement capacity and supporting schools in digital learning to navigate through unexpected emergencies like a pandemic.

        "Background: Students' tendencies to seek feedback are associated with improved learning. Yet, how soon this association becomes robust enough to make predictions about learning is not fully understood. Such knowledge has strong implications for early identification of students at‐risk for underachievement via digital learning platforms. Objectives: We sought to understand how early in the academic year students' end‐of‐year learning outcomes could be predicted by their performance and feedback‐seeking behaviours within a digital learning platform. We analysed data collected at different time points in the academic year and across different cohorts of students within the context of high school advanced placement (AP) Statistics courses. Methods: High school students enrolled in AP Statistics spanning three academic years between 2017 and 2020 (N = 726; Mage = 16.72 years) completed 3 or 4 homework assignments, each 2 and 3 months apart. Results and conclusions: Across the three cohorts, and even as early as the first assignment, a model consisting of demographic variables (gender, race/ethnicity, parental education), assignment performance, and interaction with the digital score report explained significant variation in students' final course grades (R2 = 0.314–0.412) and AP exam scores (κ = 0.583–0.689). Students' assignment performance was positively associated with end‐of‐year learning outcomes. Students who more frequently checked their digital score reports tended to receive better learning outcomes, though not consistently across cohorts. Implications: These findings further an understanding of how students' early performance and feedback‐seeking behaviours within a digital learning platform predict end‐of‐year learning outcomes. Lay Description: What is already known about this topic: Students' early academic performance predicts end‐of‐year success.Students' self‐regulated learning behaviours are another predictor of academic success.Clickstream data have been used as an indicator of the application of self‐regulated learning strategies, particularly behaviours associated with seeking feedback.Indicators of feedback‐seeking behaviours reflected via clickstream data have been shown to predict student learning.Yet, how soon associations between early performance and such indicators of self‐regulated learning as feedback‐seeking are robust across different groups of learners, different learning circumstances, and different types of learning outcomes has yet to be more fully understood. What this paper adds: We investigated whether performance and feedback‐seeking behaviours predict end‐of‐year learning outcomes at different points during the academic year across multiple cohorts of learners (2017–2018, 2018–2019, and 2019–2020) and using two different learning outcomes (class grades, AP exam scores).One cohort was affected by COVID‐19 during the 2019–2020 academic year, allowing us to examine whether differences emerge amidst unprecedented circumstances.We used assignment scores and online feedback‐seeking to predict end‐of‐year learning outcomes.Assignment scores were positively associated with end‐of‐year grades.First assignment performance predicted AP exam scores.Use of feedback (an indication of self‐regulated learning behaviours) tended to predict learning outcomes, though not consistently across cohorts. Implications for practice and/or policy: The findings from this study could improve understanding of how digital learning platform measurements predict end‐of‐year learning outcomes though also highlight the importance of context differences.Such findings hold implications for early identification of at‐risk students and appreciation for differences between learners and contexts.These findings also contribute to a growing understanding of the impact of the COVID‐19 pandemic on student engagement and learning.

        "This qualitative case study explored the experiences of a digital technology (DT) coach over the duration of a school year, as she forged her role and sought to support elementary teachers' abilities to integrate technology in instruction across the curriculum. In a school district in Ontario, Canada, the DT coach engaged teachers in individualised, face-to-face, classroom-based coaching and facilitated small group professional learning meetings. This study sought to understand how a DT coach navigates her role, with attention to the factors that affected her ability to support teachers. Multiple data sources were collected including observational field notes from group meetings and classroom-based coaching sessions with teacher participants, as well as individual interviews with the coach and a convenience sampling of teacher participants. Analyses of these data derived six interconnected themes: flexibility and responsiveness, authenticity and humility, growth mindset, relationships, engagement, and resourcefulness in overcoming constraints. Implications include the need to further examine the characteristics of effective DT coaches, with particular attention to their flexibility, humility, and learning orientations. Additionally, this study revealed the need for further research exploring the professional learning of DT coaches and continued exploration of factors that affect the efficacy of DT coaching.

        "It is well‐established that being a self‐regulated learner is beneficial academically, motivationally and is considered essential for productive life‐long learning. Despite this, there is limited evidence examining how different measures of self‐regulation for learning (SRL) relate to task performance for young students learning in digital contexts. This study investigated the relationships between different measures of SRL of elementary school students (N = 48, Mage = 10.75) while using a computer‐based learning environment, and their association with task performance and teacher rating of student SRL ability. Results confirmed the most effective measure of SRL, in terms of its relationship with, and predictability of task performance, was a self‐report written response, whereby students identified and explained known SRL strategies, such as how to plan, monitor or complete their work. Teacher ratings of their students' metacognitive capability were significantly correlated with task performance and with two self‐report instruments: the Junior Metacognitive Awareness Inventory and the SRL written response. Associations between actual observed self‐regulation behaviours in a computer‐based learning environment, using Azevedo et al.'s coding framework and how students self‐reported their knowledge and understanding about SRL, were weak. Observations of young students' SRL behaviours in computer‐based learning environments were not significantly related to task performance. Better understanding of these relationships will help educators and researchers to know where they should focus their attention in terms of developing elementary school students' self‐regulatory capabilities in digital contexts, as well as the reliability of self‐report measures of SRL as relative to observations of self‐regulation and task performance. Implications for teacher practice are also discussed. Practitioner notesWhat is already known about this topic Students need to use self‐regulation for learning (SRL) strategies in digital contexts.Self‐regulation strategies need to be explicitly taught to students as they are not guaranteed to become automatically acquired.Being a self‐regulated learner leads to improved academic performance, engagement and motivation.What this paper adds Empirical evidence addressing the associations and patterns between various measures of SRL for young students learning in digital environments.Student self‐report explanations of known SRL strategies was the only significant predictor of student task performance.Coding of young students' SRL behaviours in digital environments do not relate well to task performance.Implications for practice and/or policy Understanding the associations between young students' self‐report of SRL and how this relates to their actual SRL behaviour while using digital technology is critical to supporting student learning and success.Learning to better articulate self‐regulation strategies may result in greater consciousness and application of self‐regulation strategies in digital contexts, which in turn could improve task performance.Eliciting explanations from students about SRL strategies may be more informative and expedient than conducting and analysing individual observations in digital contexts, to determine the general self‐regulatory knowledge and understanding of young students.

        "Drawing upon 15 semi-structured interviews with teachers at a Catholic school in the British city of Hull, we offer new qualitative insights on the effects of students' unequal access to digital tools when switching to distance learning in the context of COVID-19 school closures. During the 2020–2021 academic year, this school serving pupils from highly dissimilar socioeconomic backgrounds distributed 300 laptops to students who did not own any digital learning device. It emerges that students with limited access to devices suffered negative impacts on their academic performance, and that this effect also applied to students who had access to a mobile device and hence did not receive a laptop. Our interviews also suggest that having to share a device with another family member leads to more absenteeism and a fall in academic attainment. Low parental involvement is shown to have negative effects on students' attainment, particularly for children from deprived backgrounds. Finally, poorer students are seen to become isolated from peers, with diminishing social skills throughout lockdowns due to their lack of access to digital tools. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "The Covid-19 lockdown in the UK during the spring of 2020 led to the closure of schools and school premises to most students, including complementary school pupils; yet while the lockdown in autumn 2020 allowed state schools to remain open, Polish complementary schools found themselves in an ambiguous position. This paper explores the experiences of eight Polish complementary school heads, focusing on their response to lockdown and the measures they took to provide online learning through the year. The paper also examines how changing lockdown policies impacted the running of their schools. Key findings suggest a creative approach was taken to learning, and that students were eager to respond. Meanwhile, there was increasing cooperation between different schools and support from external organisations. However, the challenges of online learning were also highlighted. Additionally, heads expressed concern about student retention and recruitment, and the potential long-term effects on their school. There was also discussion about the position of complementary schools within the broader education system. The paper argues that these findings highlight questions of inequality between the complementary and mainstream sectors, which has been exacerbated by the pandemic. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "We argue in this paper that there is currently no adequate theoretical framework or model that spans the twelve odd year trajectory from non‐reader to proficient reader, nor addresses fine‐grain skill acquisition, mastery and integration. The target construct itself, reading proficiency, as often operationalized as an endpoint of formal secondary schooling, is defined and measured in imprecise, fragmented terms. Consequently, schools (and empirical research) fall back on heuristics like the Simple View of Reading, or a few stages (learn to read, read to learn, read to do) to describe reading development. Those models, however, are too general to guide instructional decisions for adaptive learning systems. Progress in engineering an adequate learning system has been inhibited by a mismatch with curriculum standards and school organization that impose good‐faith but not fully optimized developmental targets on the educational system. We propose the development of a learning and assessment framework to scaffold reading proficiency development while accounting for the diverse learning trajectories of groups or individuals across development. We then identify some key problems, challenges and opportunities that AI technologies are poised to help us address in conceiving individualized, adaptive learning systems for reading proficiency across the developmental spectrum. We close with a selective review of examples of AI‐enhanced research or products. Practitioner notesWhat is already known about this topic Reading proficiency is a vital component of education systems design.Theoretical and empirical studies across multiple disciplines have been published, but much of this research is framed in fragmented theories that do not seamlessly span the trajectory of life‐long reading development.Current assessments are time‐consuming, coarse‐grained and fail to provide a roadmap for educators and designers of adaptive learning environments.There is a significant lack of knowledge of potentially non‐linear growth in reading skills within or between years and how to design adaptive instruction for diverse subpopulations.What this paper adds We describe the initial steps towards a literacy learning and assessment framework that spans the trajectory from non‐reader to proficient reader.We provide a landscape of exemplars of artificial intelligence and computational linguistics that reflect the possibilities of a more comprehensive, cohesive literacy development system.We reflect upon key problems, challenges and opportunities that AI technologies can help address in conceiving individualized, adaptive learning systems for reading proficiency across the developmental spectrum.Implications for practice and/or policy AI and computational linguistics can help fill in the gaps in understanding and enacting a longitudinal vision of reading development.Educators would ideally know what to expect of their students at particular points of development, identify deviations and have additional tools to intervene effectively to maximize progress.There is a need to develop adaptive instruction that spans the development of proficiency from preschool to college/career levels and adapts to address common barriers among diverse subpopulations.

        "The article aims to determine the correspondence of the value orientations of students and teachers to the pragmatic and civilizational goals of political education in the process of introducing digital information and communication technologies for sustainable development. The study involved 92 students of the School of Marxism, TongJi University, who are receiving political education at the master's level in the speciality \"Political Science\" using digital mobile and cloud information and communication educational technologies, and 83 teachers of political disciplines of this university. The authors used the Portrait Values Questionnaire (PVQ) and the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire (EPQ). The accumulation, sorting and visualization of information in the course of the study were carried out in the Microsoft Excel program. The statistical significance and significance of the results of the study were assessed based on the Student's t-test, which was calculated using the online calculator Social Science Statistics. Statistically significant (p < 0.05) differences between the motivational educational values of students and teachers have revealed: the teachers expressed conformity largely than the students (4.6 ± 0.2 and 3.4 ± 0.1 points, respectively) and the importance of traditions (4.9 ± 0.1 and 3.5 ± 0.3 points), and the students - independence (4.5 ± 0.2 vs. 3.3 ± 0.1 points). According to the neuroticism scale, the indicators of the teachers (15.6 ± 2.4) are at the upper limit of the norm and statistically significantly (p < 0.05) exceed the hands of the students (10.2 ± 1.0). The difference in the hierarchy of values of students receiving political education using digital information and communication technologies and teachers of political disciplines was revealed, reflecting the presence of a conflict between the pragmatic and civilizational goals of political education in the process of introducing digital information and communication technologies, primarily about the opposition of traditions and universalism, conformism and the desire for power and achievement.

        "The paper introduces the student‐coined term digital instinct which describes students' disposition to resorting to digital technology for solving problems and doing school assignments. Taking cues from the term digital instinct, the paper describes a student perspective on digital literacy emerging from 100 lived experience descriptions and interviews with 37 Danish upper secondary students. The findings show that students' digital practice is characterised by experience‐based, intuitive and familiar use of technologies. Most notably, students employ digital technologies as cognitive partners that help them carry on with assignments that they initially did not understand, but that they were able to complete with the help of the computer. The study examines the nature of this partnership through the words of the students and identifies how technologies expand student agency but fall short of a reflective use of digital technologies. Recognising the strengths and weaknesses of students' digital practices may inform the concept of digital literacy and encourage teachers to acknowledge the digital instinct as a steppingstone to foster students' reflective use of digital technologies. Practitioner notesWhat is already known about this topic Students have inadequate command of digital literacies as described in curricular terminology.Students have positive as well as negative perceptions of the value and usefulness of digital technologies in school.Students both over‐ and underestimate their own digital literacies.What this paper adds Students have a fundamental utilitarian conception of digital technologies that either make schoolwork easier or more difficult, and they do not articulate that their use of digital technologies provides them with digital literacies.Students' conception of a digital instinct describes an intuitive and familiar, albeit unreflected, use of technologies where students employ experience‐based and self‐taught methods for using digital technologies.The digital instinct accounts for a feeling of agency among students, manifested in a widespread confidence that they can do assignments and solve problems when they make use of their computer.Implications for practice and/or policy Curricular terminologies struggle to capture what students can and cannot do with technology, and how much they understand the underlying technology.Teachers can involve and build on students' experience‐based digital practices as a starting point for developing digital literacy among students—also as an entry to a curricular perspective.Teachers should acknowledge students' conception of a 'digital instinct' as an important disposition in its own right.

        "In Spring 2020, the UK Government announced the cessation of in-person teaching for the vast majority of school-aged children in response to the Covid-19 pandemic. Prompting an accelerated shift towards digital learning across the curriculum, this announcement was accompanied by a rise in market-based solutions to address the problem of keeping young people active, 'healthy' and 'positive' whilst at home. The most prominent of these was offered by Joe Wicks, who broadcasted PE with Joe live globally via YouTube for five days per week for eighteen weeks. The aim of this paper is to critically explore some of the contextual factors that enabled Joe Wicks to create and legitimise a public health intervention under the title of physical education, and henceforth position himself (whether intentionally or not) as an authoritative agent for change within the discipline. After outlining who Joe Wicks is, we unpack the discursive framing of PE with Joe in order to locate Wicks' intervention amid the perennial politics of physical education. We then consider the meaning of PE with Joe and why Joe Wicks' involvement in physical education matters, reflecting upon the effects of Joe Wicks on the future of physical education practice and research. Among our conclusions is that the Covid-19 pandemic provided an opportunity for Joe Wicks – here positioned and understood as a branded, celebrity lifestyle enterprise – to manoeuvre himself (and his products) from the periphery to the centre of physical education's public imagery and discourse. Furthermore, we argue that exploring the ways in which Wicks' presence in the physical education space has been received, embraced, modified, challenged and resisted is vital in discerning PE with Joe's actual or perceived effects on the social construction of physical education, and the educational engagements of young people in physical activity in the post-Covid-19 landscape.

        "This paper reports some results of a study on how Colombian primary-school teachers, experienced in the use of technological tools, integrate digital resources into their practice. Specifically, we investigate the processes of selection and integration (including appropriation and orchestration) of these resources in the teaching of geometry. We aim to illustrate the potential paths (along with associated criteria) that teachers follow when selecting and integrating digital resources into their practice, using the Documentational Approach to Didactics. Accordingly, we present case studies of a 1st-grade teacher and a 5th-grade teacher, which describe their paths during their respective geometry lessons. The paths followed by the teachers were influenced by their knowledge and beliefs regarding the utilisation of digital technology resources and the potential student engagement with such resources. All these aspects come into play as teachers select and orchestrate digital resources. Our empirical data analysis enabled us to infer several criteria for resource selection and levels of orchestration and appropriation manifested by the teachers as they integrated digital resources into their classes. This work can provide valuable insights for further exploration of how teachers integrate digital resources, and can contribute to the development of professional development programmes.

        "The nine-year compulsory education policy is a priority state policy in China. The transition to online learning caused by the COVID-19 pandemic turned out to be especially difficult for elementary school students, primarily in the organizational aspect. The need to ensure quality education and effective learning outcomes regardless of its form determined the research relevance. Thus, the purpose of the study is to consider the impact of the digital transformation of basic education on the development of first-graders' cognitive abilities. The study involved 205 first-grade students: 112 girls and 93 boys, their average age was 6.4 years. The experimental group consisted of three student groups (98 first-graders). The control group also involved three student groups (115 children). The null hypothesis that both online learning and traditional classroom activities have the same effect on the development of cognitive abilities in first graders was statistically confirmed.

        "Introduction: Virtual worlds (VWs) are immersive three‐dimensional environments, accessible simultaneously to multiple users, and described as shared, simulated spaces, whose inhabitants represented as avatars. VWs enable freedom of expression. Using VWs in educational contexts requires a shift from teacher‐centered instruction to facilitation of student‐centered learning practices. Method: This study explores the degree of teacher centrality (Sage‐on‐the‐stage, Facilitator, Guide‐on‐the‐side, or Partner), pedagogical strategies used in the integration of an Open Sim‐based VW learning platform in face‐to‐face K‐12 classrooms, and consistency between the perspectives of teachers and students on these topics. We conducted semi‐structured interviews followed by observations of actual VW environments with 12 elementary teachers of different subject‐matters and 11 fifth and sixth graders who learn with VWs. Findings: Although all teaching prototypes were present in the data, the most dominant teaching prototypes in the VW environment were 'Guide‐on‐the‐side' and 'Facilitator', while 'Sage‐on‐the‐stage' and 'Partner' were less frequent. The findings indicate that the most prevalent pedagogical strategies used to teach in VW‐enhanced classrooms were Experiential Learning, followed by Training practice and modeling, Project‐based learning, Game‐based learning, and Collaborative learning. Minor differences were found between the perspectives of teachers and students regarding teaching prototypes and the degree of teacher centrality in the classroom. Importantly, both teachers and students positioned students as the main designers of learning activities in the VW environment. Implications: The findings of this pioneer research provide insights regarding the teaching prototypes and the degree of teacher centrality in the VW learning environment that can help improve teaching processes and professional training courses in virtual 3D environments. Lay Description: What is already known about this topic: Virtual Worlds (VWs) facilitate student‐centered pedagogy and offer opportunities for envisioning new learning environments.Using innovative technologies such as VWs does not naturally promote student‐centered learning and requires effective pedagogical design.Grasha's categorized the following five instructional types: (1) Expert, (2) Formal authority, (3) Personal model, (4) Facilitator, and (5) Delegator.Prototypes of teachers that reflect their degree of centrality in the classroom are: (1) Sage‐on‐the‐stage, (2) Facilitator, (3) Guide‐on‐the‐side, and (4) Partner. What this paper adds: The research examined the teaching prototypes and the degree of teacher centrality in integration of the innovative Open Sim‐based virtual world in K‐12 settings.Interviews with teachers and elementary school students were followed by guided observations of actual VW environments integrated in different subject‐matters.More dominant teaching prototypes were 'Guide‐on‐the‐side' and 'Facilitator', while 'Sage‐on‐the‐stage' and 'Partner' were less common.The most prevalent pedagogical strategies in VW‐enhanced classrooms were Experiential Learning, followed by Training practice and modeling, and PBL. Implications for practice and/or policy: The findings provide insights that can help improve professional training courses in virtual 3D environments and similar emerging educational technologies.The suggested integrated model of teacher prototypes can be used to analyze the role and the degree of teacher centrality in technology‐enhanced classrooms.

        "Due to the global COVID-19 pandemic, educational institutions were compelled to transition from traditional-learning to emergency remote e-learning rapidly. In light of this, the present study aims to investigate the effect of a broader range of student characteristics on attitudes towards e-learning during the pandemic in a mixed-mode learning environment. The investigated students' characteristics are gender, previous experience in e-learning, perceived level of IT skills, high school background, study program indicative of the extent of technology use, teaching method employed during the pandemic, time devoted to e-learning, the device employed for e-learning, and residence status. The newly developed Students' Attitudes Towards E-learning Scale (SAES) was administered to a sample of 1058 first-year engineering students at the University of Novi Sad. The results of factor analysis revealed three factors of the SAES: positive attitudes, negative attitudes, and institutional support for emergency e-learning. Results showed that students from different study programs showed significant differences in their perception of online learning, indicating the role of the course curriculum. Additionally, students from the gymnasium (grammar school) who attended online classes during the pandemic and had prior experience in e-learning showed more positive attitudes towards e-learning, while students who engaged in the combined teaching method in high school and spent more hours in e-learning showed more negative attitudes towards e-learning. Gender does not affect attitudes towards e-learning. Emphasising the importance of examining diverse student characteristics, this study highlights institutional support for e-learning for commuter students and those who spend more time on e-learning.

        "This study explored teachers' perceptions of synchronous online peer interaction (SOPI) among young learners (YLs), aged 7 to 15. Thirty-eight teachers of diverse L1 backgrounds and teaching experience completed a survey and attended an in-depth interview that explored multiple aspects of SOPI (e.g. benefits, issues, frequency of use, strategies to promote SOPI's effectiveness, and mediating factors). Survey data were analysed using exploratory factor analyses to identify themes/constructs related to areas of SOPI under investigation, and inferential statistics were reported to examine teachers' self-ratings of different aspects of SOPI. Interviews were analysed following a content-based approach to supplement the quantitative data. The results show that teachers believed SOPI promoted YLs' attention to language aspects and created a peer-support learning environment. SOPI's effectiveness was affected by multiple factors (e.g. learners' individual differences, teachers' guidance, grouping, and learners' financial and family backgrounds). Teachers expressed the importance of using SOPI for YLs in online classes and suggested instruction/guidance to maximize its' benefits. However, the frequency of use of SOPI was reported to be dependent on schools' regulations and resources, learners' affective aspects, and parental support. The results also indicate the impact of teachers' online teaching experience on their differential perceptions of online SOPI. Nghiên cứu này tìm hiểu quan điểm của giáo viên về hoạt động tương tác trực tuyến giữa các học sinh ở độ tuổi từ 7 đến 15 tuổi trong các lớp học tiếng Anh trực tuyến. Đối tượng nghiên cứu bao gồm 38 giáo viên có kinh nghiệm giảng dạy khác nhau và nói nhiều tiếng mẹ đẻ khác nhau. Các giáo viên này tham gia khảo sát và phỏng vấn chuyên sâu về nhiều khía cạnh của hoạt động tương tác trực tuyến với bạn đồng trang lứa. Các khía cạnh này bao gồm lợi ích, vấn đề, tần suất sử dụng, chiến lược để thúc đẩy hiệu quả của hoạt động tương tác trực tuyến với bạn đồng trang lứa, cũng như những yếu tố ảnh hưởng đến tính hiệu quả của nó. Dữ liệu khảo sát được phân tích bằng phương pháp phân tích nhân tố khám phá để xác định các nhóm/yếu tố liên quan đến các khía cạnh của hoạt động tương tác trực tuyến với bạn đồng lứa, và sử dụng thống kê suy luận để xem xét quan điểm của giáo viên về các mặt của hoạt động tương tác trực tuyến với bạn đồng lứa. Các cuộc phỏng vấn được phân tích theo cách tiếp cận dựa trên nội dung để bổ sung dữ liệu định lượng. Kết quả cho thấy các giáo viên tin rằng hoạt động tương tác trực tuyến với bạn đồng lứa đã thúc đẩy sự chú ý của học viên nhỏ tuổi đối với các khía cạnh ngôn ngữ, và tạo ra một môi trường học tập tích cực. Tuy nhiên, tính hiệu quả của hoạt động tương tác trực tuyến với bạn đồng lứa bị ảnh hưởng bởi nhiều yếu tố, ví dụ, sự khác biệt cá nhân của người học, hướng dẫn của giáo viên, người làm việc chung, và hoàn cảnh gia đình. Các giáo viên tham gia nghiên cứu nhấn mạnh tầm quan trọng của việc sử dụng hoạt động tương tác trực tuyến với bạn đồng lứa khi dạy các lớp học trực tuyến cho học sinh nhỏ tuổi, và đề xuất nhiều phương pháp để tối đa hóa lợi ích của nó. Về tần suất sử dụng hoạt động tương tác trực tuyến với bạn đồng lứa, giáo viên cho rằng các quy định và nguồn tài nguyên của trường, các khía cạnh cảm xúc của người học, và sự hỗ trợ của phụ huynh ảnh hưởng đến tần suất sử dụng. Kết quả nghiên cứu này cũng chỉ ra rằng kinh nghiệm giảng dạy trực tuyến của giáo viên có ảnh hưởng đến cách họ nhìn nhận các vấn đề liên quan đến hoạt động tương tác trực tuyến với bạn đồng lứa. To obtain a comprehensive understanding of language teachers' practices in the classroom, it is necessary to know how teachers think about these practices. In this research, we attempted to explore how language teachers perceived young learners (YLs)' synchronous online interaction. We interviewed and surveyed language teachers from different language and teaching backgrounds about their perceptions of the benefits, issues, and frequency of using learner-learner (peer) interaction in online English classes for YLs. We also asked the teachers about factors affecting the effectiveness of online peer interaction, and what strategies they used to promote learner engagement in online language classes. The results from the survey and interviews revealed that teachers believed synchronous online peer interaction promoted young learners' attention to language issues as well as created a sense of peer-support in the online learning environment. However, the teachers cited many factors affecting the effectiveness of the use of online peer interaction. They included, for example, learners' individual differences, teachers' guidance, grouping, and learners' financial and family backgrounds. The teachers also highlighted the importance of using peer interaction for YLs in online classes and suggested various strategies to maximize its benefits. Additionally, the teachers stated that the schools' regulations and resources, learners' affective aspects, and parental support affected and determined the extent to which they would be using peer interaction in their online classes.

        "Although the significance of a positive social classroom climate in face-to-face learning has been established, its role within online and technology-enhanced learning environments is unclear. The central aim of this systematic review was to synthesize the findings of empirical studies which have examined any aspect of the social classroom climate in online and technology-enhanced learning environments in primary and secondary schools. Appropriate search terms were entered into ACM Digital Library, Web of Science, Scopus, and ERIC in November 2021. Articles were included if they were relevant for the aim, reported primary data, sampled primary/secondary school students and/or teachers, and were published in journals, conference proceedings, or book chapters in English. Furthermore, articles were excluded if they focused on the development/testing of measurement tools. The thematic narrative synthesis includes 29 articles, comprising of qualitative, quantitative, and mixed-method studies. A quality assessment checklist was completed for all. The findings encompass examinations of the social classroom climate in online learning before and during the Covid-19 pandemic, in blended learning environments and a comparison between them. Furthermore, associations between the online social classroom climate and academic variables is explored, as is the fostering thereof through synchronous/asynchronous discussion groups and social media. We discuss the theoretical framing of the studies, the impact of a positive classroom climate in online and technology-enhanced learning environments on students, as well as practical approaches and new opportunities in leveraging technologies. Based on the findings and the studies' limitations we outline implications and future research, such as the need to consider students' voices and diversity, technology perspectives, a transdiciplinary approach and the reconceptualization of boundaries.

        "With the rapid growth of education data in large-scale assessment, machine learning techniques are crucial to the interdisciplinary development of education and information. Although data mining tools are increasingly used to predict overall student performance, resilient students in the digital world remain unstudied. Our study aims to comprehensively identify key features in the classification of academically resilient students (ARS) and non-academically resilient students (NRS) in digital reading. With a sample of 11,496 disadvantaged students from seven high-performing Asian economies, data drawn from the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2018 were analyzed through Support Vector Machine (SVM). Results indicated that 20 key features were selected from 105 contextual features at the individual, home, and school levels, which demonstrated a high predictive ability of the model. Personal experience, especially the use of metacognitive strategies in digital reading and reading enjoyment were predominant features. Interestingly, information and communication technology (ICT) resources and usage showed mixed effects on resilient students. This study provides significant implications for cultivating resilient students in online learning environments. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "Despite interest in online learning for meeting student needs at scale, existing research finds relatively low levels of engagement in most forms of virtual learning, especially among economically disadvantaged students. This is concerning as the Covid-19 pandemic forced a dramatic increase in remote learning among students and educators who did not specifically opt into the model. We study an early innovative effort to virtually serve such K-12 students and teachers and to capitalize on the unique advantages of distance learning to promote educational equity amid the pandemic. This five-week, largely synchronous, summer program served nearly 12,000 rising 4th–9th graders, mostly low-income students of color. To expand access to excellent educators, \"mentor teachers,\" selected based on merit, provided PD and videos of themselves teaching daily lessons to \"partner teachers\" across the country. We interviewed a representative sample of teachers and analyzed educator, parent, and student surveys. Our study adds to the existing online learning literature by illustrating that it is possible to virtually engage a more generalizable set of students and teachers than have previously been studied and to use technology to extend the reach of talented teachers. Strategies for online engagement that scholars have identified when studying more specialized groups pre-pandemic appear relevant with a more generalizable population, such as the inclusion of meaningful content and a synchronous delivery format. Consistent with prior research, teachers appreciate receiving adaptable curricular materials and differentiated PD. Findings have implications for future uses of online learning, during periods of disruption and more typical times. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "When school closure was mandated due to COVID-19, staff at a university lab preschool in Trinidad rapidly switched to remote teaching. Although the six teachers were experienced early childhood educators, they were unfamiliar with teaching remotely using video conferencing tools and websites. Guided by a consultant and an educational technologist, an indigenous remote early childhood program for 3- to 4-year-old learners was introduced using the Padlet platform and Zoom. This qualitative descriptive case study investigated the challenges teachers experienced and how they adapted to provide continuity in teaching in a changed pedagogical context. Using the Resilience in Human Development theoretical framework the research questions asked: What were the challenges experienced by early childhood teachers in delivering their first emergency remote teaching program? And, how did teachers overcome the challenges which arose in delivering emergency remote teaching to young learners? Guided by Creswell's (2016) recommendation to collect and analyze data from multiple sources, teacher questionnaires, written teacher reflections, parent questionnaires, and feedback provided by a consultant were the data sources. Findings revealed themes related to five teacher challenges and four parent challenges. The strategies used to overcome the challenges included: Becoming proactive, Introducing Innovations, and Tapping into motivation. Policy implications and recommendations to support continuity in teaching during emergencies at the school and national levels are included. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "This article analyzes the development, commercialization and demise of the Smaky school computer in French-speaking, Western Switzerland between 1973 and 1997. By examining archival material, I consider the connections between this locally assembled and used school computer, and the globally embedded economic developments during the period of investigation. I argue that, historically, the Smaky was both a product of and a response to the region's economic crisis in the 1970s and early 1980s. Analytically speaking, I critically reflect on the seemingly contradictory categories of 'global' and 'local'. Although these were politically effective among historical actors, they are of limited use in the historical analysis of digital educational technologies. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "At the beginning of the twenty-first century, Spanish scholars started to pay particular attention to the history of schools' material culture, defining this as \"etnohistoria de la escuela\". Reflections on the \"materiality of schooling\" and \"school heritage\" continued in the years that followed. Teaching tools or, more widely, \"school objects\" challenge the concepts of space, time and sociality. They speak of school practices, cultural history, and ideology. School artefacts are either handmade products created by pupils and teachers, or the school equipment that is made up of commercial products, which also respond to an industrial and economic logic, linked to the achievement of mass schooling. The aims and means of education are intermingled, but if educational theories have long attracted scholars' attention, the history of educational objects can be further explored from different angles. This paper shows the connection between educational models and pedagogical tools, but also between ideology and the cultural dimension of pedagogical objects, and between economy and pedagogical artefacts. ISCHE 43 was dedicated to the histories of educational technologies and the articles in this special issue of Paedagogica Historica represent some of the leading papers presented at the conference, which was held for the first time as a hybrid event at the Catholic University of Milan from 31 August to 6 September 2022.

        "In 2019, the University of the Arts London (UAL) declared a Climate Emergency and undertook to make sustainability a required part of the student learning experience. Subsequently, in 2021, UAL published an anti-racism action plan and declared itself an activist university. These initiatives require educators across UAL's six constituent colleges – of which Central Saint Martins (CSM) is one – to underpin creative arts learning and teaching with an understanding of global ecologies and societal structures. Since the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic, a considerable amount of this teaching has been delivered online. This case study – based on data gathered from students participating in online workshops – seeks to understand how established teaching practices, such as object-based and experiential learning, can be mobilized to support student understanding of these complex global and societal issues in an online learning environment. We also address the challenges and benefits of teaching art and design subjects using educational technology and ask whether experiential pedagogies can be successfully translated for delivery online.

        "The main objective of this research is to determine the perception of teachers about the elements that increases the educational effectiveness of gamified apps in primary education. A methodology based on an importance-performance analysis was daeveloped, using a structural equations model to calcuate the degree of importance of each variable. The sample was formed of 212 Spanish teachers with experience using educational apps in the teaching–learning process. Six categories were identified as precursors of educational effectiveness: (1) curriculum connection, (2) feedback and operational experience, (3) assessment and learning analytics, (4) sustainability (Protection Personal data), (5) equal access and (6) flow. These six categories enhance the three traditional areas of gamification intervention: cognitive, emotional and social. In this sense, the design and adoption of an educational gamified app should: (1) establish a clear link between the game and curricular content and competence development; (2) promote self-regulated learning through individual and collaborative activities; (3) offer adapted learning by integrating differentiated personalized learning pathways; (4) integrate learning analytics that can be consulted by teacher, student and family; (5) comply with data protection regulation and promote a safe, sustainable and ethical use of the information generated; (6) take into account different levels of functional diversity. When the gamified app design incorporates these attributes, primary education teachers perceive that such resources can be integrated effectively into the teaching–learning processes.

        "The COVID-19 pandemic caused the closures of schools worldwide and a move to remote learning. This article presents the findings of a study that explored the use of digital technology during school closures in Australia, drawing on the perspectives of primary school teachers and parents. Data were collected using Facebook groups and semi-structured interviews, and a thematic analysis conducted. The results describe seven themes associated with the teacher and parent experiences of remote learning: learning how to teach and learn remotely; learning to use technology; moving away from technology; hardware and internet access; collaboration and communication; social connection; and technology and engagement. The findings indicate the need to prioritise teachers' technological and pedagogical skills as standard practice; include parents in the development of remote learning skills; and move away from transformative rhetoric around educational technologies to a more realistic and needs-based approach.

        "Developing a knowledge of design and construction technology and engineering is often overlooked in favour of 'digital' technology such as tablets and computers. By taking children outdoors into nature, removing tablets and computers as well as artificial and synthetic materials and replacing them with only what nature provides, children become attuned to developing STEM knowledge through play with natural materials. This knowledge often develops through teacher support and at times by default, as children experience the constantly changing landscape of the natural environment. The development of children's understandings of 'nature's' technology and engineering provides an opportunity for further investigation of nature-based early childhood education and care settings. Through research conducted at four Australian bush kindergartens, this paper presents data from photographs, interviews and observations undertaken of twelve teachers and over one hundred and twenty children. It responds to the research question, how do early years learners develop their understanding of technology and engineering by engaging in nature-based learning? The research was undertaken using ethnography, a useful method in nature settings as the approach enables a deep understanding of how children develop their understandings of applying technology and engineering over time. The data demonstrate the benefits preschool children can gain from learning and being 'in' and 'with' nature and the important role bush kinders play in supporting children's technological and engineering literacy. Findings reveal that through their participation in bush kinder, children can develop technological and engineering knowledge. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "This paper explores and sheds light on how various designs of game-based learning materials benefit music education. The developed games followed Gordon's music skill learning sequence of discrimination, and aimed to teach listening and visual skills for the middle C octave. Two genres of game-based learning materials were proposed, one with most game design features and the other which excluded most game mechanisms but retained simple gamification features. A total of 34 elementary school students participated in the experiment and were separated into three groups to learn music with the game-based learning materials. The pros and cons of using various music game-based learning materials for learning performance and learning motivation are summarized. The findings suggest that teachers could adopt the simple version game as a course assisting tool to enable immediate game interaction with students in formal music classes, and the full version game could be provided to learners for after-class informal learning. Besides, the full version could be a trigger for advanced learners to challenge themselves, whereas the simple version would be good for novice learners to acquire the targeted music content more smoothly.

        "The purpose of the study is to determine the effectiveness of mobile applications in conjunction with the students' online collaboration in the educational environment of Chinese colleges (the context of learning English). The students were selected from all those who study English in their educational programs. At the first stage, they passed a test on the level of language knowledge and among 423 students 140 were selected who had a level of B2 and below. Then they were divided into control and experimental groups. Each had 70 people. The experimental group was trained using the following mobile applications: Busuu, Lingoda, LinguaLeo, BBC Learning English. The results showed that the participants in the experimental group scored higher on the final test (74.71) than the control group participants (65.9). It suggests that mobile learning technologies can improve student achievement. The preliminary test determined the level of knowledge of the experimental group students in this way: 85% of students know English at the B2 level, 14% - B1, and 1% - A2. These figures improved significantly in the second test: the number of students who reached the C2 level was 7%, C1–79%, and 14% of all students remained with the B2 level. For the control group students, these indicators remained unchanged. Most of the students found this format of education suitable and interesting for online collaboration. These results may be useful for teaching practice, because they provide evidence base with the experimental research for the introduction of mobile technologies in the modern educational process. It solves the problem of using the certain mobile applications (Busuu, Lingoda, LinguaLeo, BBC Learning English) that have not been explored before. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "Research objectives: identify which thinking skills are optimal for employment in the new digital era; determine the impact of digital learning technologies on the development of critical thinking skills of college students, and provide effective recommendations for developing critical thinking skills. The study was conducted among third-year students from Chang'an University in China. Other necessary professional skills have been identified. Analysis of ANCOVA data showed that members of the experimental group successfully completed more tasks on the test (74.71%) than students in the control group (65.90%). In summary, cutting-edge interactive learning technologies can significantly improve students' critical thinking as compared to the traditional approach to learning. Recommendations for developing critical thinking skills among students have been provided. The findings may be relied upon when developing an action plan to streamline the learning process, so that students' professional skills may be developed in an effective way. The research findings: provide some knowledge about improving students' critical thinking skills in a digital interactive environment; can help instructors address this issue, as well as validate the findings of other studies of the positive impact of digital learning technology tools on students' critical thinking.

        "Prior research has demonstrated the advantages of applying mobile game-based learning (MGBL) applications to supporting students' learning. However, studies that specifically examine the effects of game quality and different types of cognitive loads on learning effectiveness in MGBL contexts are scarce. Therefore, this study aims to address this research gap by developing and validating a research model of cognitive loads and learning performance in MGBL contexts. Data collected from 130 college students who were asked to use an MGBL application developed specifically for this study were analyzed to validate the research model. The results indicate that both game quality of MGBL applications and extraneous cognitive load of the users of the MGBL application have significant effects on their perceived and actual learning effectiveness, while their germane cognitive load significantly influences their perceived learning effectiveness only. Implications for theory and for practice of the research results are discussed subsequently. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "The role of techniques involving Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been becoming increasingly important in educational settings. This study aims to reveal the recent trends in research into artificial intelligence in special education by using the systematic review method. Across the 29 studies published between 2008 and 2020 that are reviewed here, the majority are articles on quantitative research carried out in the United States. In terms of learning content, most of the studies are about skill development, focusing on cognitive and affective factors. Moreover, the research was carried out in school settings with learners from various backgrounds. The purposes for and methods of using AI were examined and it was found that software-based methods are more common. The primary disability type examined in the articles covered in this review were disorders on the autism spectrum. There is a tendency toward technical models rather than educational models. ANN and SVM are the most used technical theoretical infrastructures. This study yielded interesting results both on the evolution of AI in special education over the years and on its future development. This paper ends with suggestions developed in light of these studies for the use of artificial intelligence in special education. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "The Taiwan government is trying to explore the benefits of using mobile devices to enhance the effectiveness of student learning. While many plans and projects have been launched, but the results are still meager. This research is thus aimed to discover the benefits and challenges of promoting mobile learning in Taiwan. 120 self-developed questionnaires were delivered to five junior high schools that have participated in governmental mobile learning projects. The results indicated that teachers give higher average scores to the benefits of mobile learning than drawbacks. The major benefits include inspiring students' learning interests, improving students' concentration, enriching the curriculum contents, and enhancing learning conveniences, while school members lacking internet security literacy and lacking adequate competences to effectively apply mobile learning in the classroom are perceived as the major challenges.

        "Recent years have seen a growing shift in Early Childhood Education from paper-based observation and documentation practices to digital documentation systems such as 'e-portfolios' and 'online learning journeys'. Here, we bring a multimodal lens to these new practices and consider the potential of digital documentation for democratic assessment practices that recognise and value all children's learning, particularly children who are living with disadvantage or in the early stages of learning English. Reporting on participatory ethnographic case studies of three diverse multicultural early years settings in London, we illustrate how digital documentation opens new possibilities for capturing the dynamic and embodied vibrancy of young children's learning and can make children's documentation more accessible to children and their parents. However, many digital documentation systems are currently designed primarily for adults, rather than for children to access and contribute to their own documentation. We suggest that adult-oriented design risks marginalising the child's voice as documentation moves from paper-based to digital formats. Our findings call for collaboration between researchers, educators and digital documentation systems designers to ensure that these relatively new tools support democratic and inclusive assessment practices, where all children's meaning-making, in whatever form, is recognised, celebrated and shared.

        "This paper introduces the concept of infrastructure into discussions on climate change and education. We focus on the links between the increased use of digital data and the central role of data infrastructures in education, and the energy infrastructure needed to support their growing use in schools and school systems. We elaborate a need for a greater accounting of the climate and related social costs of these interwoven digital and energy infrastructures of schooling. We suggest this is part of the 'disposition' of the infrastructures of schooling that should be weighed into decisions on whether and how to continue with digital technologies in schools. By acknowledging the climate and environmental incommensurability of digital infrastructures, education leaders and young people can more fully understand their dispositions and their costs. We propose three implications for education governance that entail greater consideration of the limits of current school climate change infrastructures such as 'eco school' programs and EdTech 'AI for good' initiatives, pushes for 'computing within limits' without substantial changes, and current school governance practices which unnecessarily rely on digital infrastructures. Instead, what is needed may be a reversal of the extensive use of digital infrastructures by schools and education governance bodies. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "Exergames are a new socio-technological phenomenon consisting of digital motor games that aim to stimulate players' motor skills. The physical-motor component of exergames has been well studied, but knowing more about their possible psychological effects in the school context is interesting to promote physical exercise practice. Gamification refers to the use of game-based elements in non-game contexts, whose aim is to motivate action by making activities more game-like. Gamification seems an innovative strategy to promote physical exercise habits at schools whose real effects are still poorly unknown. Physical education has significant direct and indirect influences on students' physical exercise. Exergames and gamification are associated with psychological benefits related to physically active behaviour. The aim of this study was to analyse the effects of a gamified exergaming school intervention on the psychological variables associated with physical exercise (PEx) promotion. We hypothesised that the gamified exergaming school intervention will produce more achievement motivation, more enjoyment, a more positive attitude towards exergames, and more exergame and PEx intention in students. A natural experiment with a non-randomised controlled design. The participants were 417 Primary Education students (53.2% girls, n = 222; 46.8% boys, n = 195) recruited from two public and two non-public schools (control group, n = 191; experimental group, n = 226). Their mean age was 11.1 (SD = 1.7), and 50.4% of the sample studied Primary Education Year 6 (aged 10–11 years; n = 210) and 49.6% studied Primary Education Year 7 (11–12 years; n = 207). The control treatment (traditional didactic intervention) was designed based on usual didactic dance teaching in Spain. Another similar experimental treatment was designed as the control treatment, but with a gamified climate and an exergame (gamified exergaming intervention). The Just Dance Now exergame was used. The Mechanics-Dynamics-Aesthetics framework was applied to achieve mastery-oriented motivational climates and an inclusive gamified atmosphere for all student-player types. Moreover, to gamify each class the ClassDojo application was used. The students completed: the Achievement Motivation in Physical Education Test (AMPET); the Sport Satisfaction Instrument (SSI); the 'Attitudes Toward Exergames' scale; the 'Exergame intention' scale; the 'Exercise Intention' scale. In order to test the research hypotheses, both study groups were compared using factorial ANOVAs 2 (time; pre-treatment condition vs. post-treatment condition) × 2 (treatment; traditional didactic intervention vs. gamified exergaming intervention). As the analysis threshold was set at ≤0.0125 with Bonferroni adjustment, the results showed better positive gamified exergaming effects on enjoyment and attitude towards exergames. No interaction effects on achievement motivation, exergame intention or PEx intention were found. This is the first study to examine an intervention combining Mechanics-Dynamics-Aesthetics (MDA) gamification framework as a didactic method and exergame as an educational resource, adopted as a strategy to promote the variables associated with encouraging PEx in primary schools. A gamified exergaming educational intervention might have some positive effects on variables associated with physical exercise promotion but its ability as an exercise promotion strategy is still unclear and future research should be conducted.

        "This research reviewed the publications in the Scopus database in the museum-based mobile learning field based on the technology-based learning review model from 2008 to 2019. The aim of this study was to investigate trends in the field of museum-based mobile learning from the main journals and papers, including countries and areas, participants, research methods, learning domains, the orientation of adopted sensing or location-based technologies, learning strategies, and research topics. The cluster and co-occurrence analysis methods were used to analyze the main key terms and the relationships between them. Three thematic clusters, namely strategies and media for mobile-based museum learning, personalized supports for mobile-based museum learning, and applications of mobile-based museum learning were identified. The results show that inquiry-based learning was the most adopted learning strategy for higher education, while contextual mobile learning was the most frequently employed strategy for elementary school students; such extensively adopted mobile learning strategies as peer assessment, project-based learning, video sharing, and synchronous sharing were not adopted in the studies. In addition, an important finding in the literature of the main research purpose of museum-based mobile learning research is the affective domain, followed by the influence of learner characteristics and the effects of mobile learning.

        "Metaverse is a digital world created by human beings according to the physical world. Its deep integration of virtual and real features has created a new opportunity for the innovative development of game teaching in art design courses in colleges and universities under the epidemic situation. In the field of art design, the investigation and research on the learning mode of its courses show that traditional teaching can hardly bring good experience to students, which is manifested in the following aspects: the lack of \"presence\" in online learning caused by epidemic situation, resulting in weak display of teaching effect, and unreasonable organization of group learning in the course. Therefore, in view of these problems, this paper puts forward three paths about the innovative application of art design courses by using the teaching strategy of Xirang games, namely, interaction on the same screen and presence experience, interaction between real individuals and virtual images, and division of cooperative learning interest groups. At last, by using the research methods of semi-structured interview, eye movement experiment and scale, it is concluded that virtual game learning plays an active role in promoting the teaching reform in colleges and universities, stimulating learners to develop higher-order thinking abilities such as creativity and criticism, solving the problems of traditional teaching, and promoting learners to move from \"outside the teaching scene\" to \"inside the teaching scene\" and from \"outside the knowledge\" to \"inside the knowledge\", which leads to a new teaching direction for the future teaching mode.

        "The concept of sustainable mobility is related to the fulfilment of certain conditions that consider environmental, economic and social factors when making decisions on transport activity. The recognition of the role of education as a key factor for sustainable development and sustainable mobility has been growing. Therefore, the development of training schemes aimed at sustainable mobility education as a tool for a better future for the generations to come is of fundamental importance. This study analyses the factors affecting the adoption of the ClassCraft platform in activities related to sustainable mobility. The proposed experience involved children aged 10–11 years old, a total of 75 pupils. This experience was the basis for analyzing the pupils' perception of the gamification-based methodology. A mixed method has been used, combining qualitative results from a Focus Group (FG) with 6 students, and quantitative results through a questionnaire based on the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) with all the 75 students. The results reflect that all students consider this methodology as an opportunity for a change in the school experience to make classroom activities more enjoyable. Our research contributes to the application of a mixed methods approach that addresses an educational challenge, considering the voice of the children when applying new teaching–learning strategies.

        "Many studies have confirmed that digital game-based learning can effectively improve students' learning motivation and that properly integrating learning strategies into digital games can effectively improve students' learning achievement. However, rare research has been considered the long-term effect of learning retention. In the current study, a game-based learning system that integrated a \"Prediction-Observation-Explanation\" learning strategy was developed to provide learners with appropriate guidance and feedback during the learning process to improve the learning retention. A quasi-experiment was conducted in an elementary school mathematics course to evaluate the effectiveness of the method. The experimental result shows that the proposed approach can significantly improve students' learning achievement and learning retention. According to the analysis of students' behavioral pattern, the proposed approach can help students focus on the learning material of the game. Therefore, the proposed approach is a potential and effective way to help students with better long-term learning performance. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "Achievement goal theory links goal setting, motivation, and learning and describes three orientations: 'mastery' (seeking learning), 'performance' (seeking positive judgments), and 'performance-avoidance' (avoiding negative judgments). Mastery orientation is considered most adaptive. The authors investigated goal orientations of traditional block clerkship (TBC) and longitudinal integrated clerkship (LIC) students. This was an exploratory study conducted at one US medical school. Three hundred and twenty students completed an anonymous survey consisting of three tools with validation evidence: Patterns of Adaptive Learning Survey, Task-choice Goal Measures, and Questionnaire Goal Choice Items. The authors analyzed the data using regression analyses, Chi-square, and Wilcoxon's rank-sum tests. While all students rated mastery items most highly on the five-point Likert scale (mean 4.58/5.00), LIC students rated performance-orientation lower (β = −0.36, p =.04), chose personal mastery-orientation items more frequently (92% vs. 64.4%, p =.005), and perceived their learning environment as promoting less performance (β = −0.60, p =.002) and performance-avoidance (β = −0.78, p <.001) compared to TBC students. LIC and TBC students differed in their report of personal and clerkship goal orientations. These differences may inform educational design and future research to promote students' mastery orientation. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "Many studies have measured the effects of separate scaffolding methods for online learning, but the various methods are seldom directly compared to provide concrete teaching suggestions. This study aims to investigate the effects of three popular scaffolding methods on students' ability to obtain resume standards, course satisfaction and engagement in an online resume writing course. Sixty-eight mixed-major undergraduate students in a private four-year college in Central Taiwan watched video lectures embedded in video-viewing Google forms before section writing. The comparison video (V) group did not receive extra support while three treatment groups (section quiz (SQ), writing rubric (WR) and peer-feedback (PF) groups) were offered scaffolding emphasizing resume genre features. The data derived from surveys and writing samples revealed that over the four-week treatment, the PF group was consistently more attentive to the organization genre standards than the other groups but performed similarly to the SQ group on grammar features. Although all groups expressed satisfaction with the course, they varied in engagement levels. The PF group reported considerably lower engagement than the SQ and V groups. The WR group was low in both writing and engagement. Therefore, the combination of scaffolding methods is recommended for implementation. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "Changes in the educational landscape due to the COVID-19 pandemic open opportunities to create instructional materials that will make teaching and learning easier. The use of a learning tool such as Learning Management System (LMS) as the online classrooms of students is one of the essentials in an online learning environment. Utilizing an action research design, this study aims to assess the designed Cloud-based Centralized Collaborative Classroom and Communication - Learning Management System (C5-LMS) using Google Classroom. The assessment of C5-LMS was anchored on the extended Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model. The respondents of the study were the faculty members, supervisors, and students of a certain college that utilized the pilot of C5-LMS design. Findings of the study revealed that the C5-LMS via Google Classroom gained \"acceptability\" among the respondents in terms of extended UTAUT constructs. Users' overall acceptance of the C5-LMS when grouped according to their roles revealed that the teacherrespondents' rating is highly acceptable, nevertheless, the superior and students' assessment is acceptable. Moreover, all the respondents confirmed that the C5-LMS has the following capabilities that corroborate the initial findings: collaboration, communication, facilitation tasks, usefulness, easy navigation, and monitoring system.

        "Background: The emergence of remote teaching during the Coronavirus (COVID‐19) pandemic caused several gaps due to teachers being unprepared to teach online. Teachers did not achieve many digital competencies, resulting in an inability to facilitate the students' learning by using technology creatively to overcome challenges. Accordingly, developing teachers' digital competencies to facilitate the teaching and learning process will: positively impact students' innovative use of digital technology in completing their tasks; consequently, develop their digital competencies; prepare them for jobs that do not yet exist; and support them for unexpected challenges they might face. Objectives: This study investigates the impact of the upskilling training programme on developing teachers' digital competence, where the aim is to investigate if the teachers' digital competence has improved from the expected intermediate level stated by the World Bank Report in 2021, where strategies for the Digital Skills Action Plan were mentioned. For instance, strategy 2 \"Reform of Digital Skills programmes\" stated that students must acquire at least intermediate level of general digital skills. Strategy 3 \"Enhance use of technologies in teaching and learning\" aims to advance teachers' digital competencies to be above the intermediate level. Accordingly, the above average level was used in the hypothesis as a benchmark of the teachers' levels after attending the upskilling training programme. The upskilling training programme of this study is a 10‐week training session using blended learning approach with instructor leading. The training's long‐term goals aim to construct a higher level of competency in a set of skills, attitudes as well as knowledge, which include digital citizenship; communication and collaboration; critical thinking, problem‐solving, and decision‐making; creativity and innovation; using technology as a tool. Methods: A sequential mixed‐method approach using quantitative and qualitative data was used. An online survey with closed‐ended items was adopted to collect quantitative data from teachers. The qualitative data was collected through teachers' focus group discussions using the Zoom conference meetings platform. The participants are K‐12 teachers from a group of national charity schools in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Results and Conclusions: The study results revealed that the upskilling training programme efficiently developed teachers' digital competence where they construct knowledge and skills. Teachers exhibit a positive attitude towards using technology that supports collaboration, learning, and productivity, consequently developing their digital competence. As a result, this will also lead to the development of the students' digital competencies, where they will be able to overcome challenges they might face in this changing world, especially after the pandemic of Covid‐19, where there is reliance on the use of technology. Takeaways: These findings aid in understanding the impact of the upskilling training programme on the development of the teachers' digital competence. Educators need to provide teachers with suitable online and face‐to‐face training that meets the teachers' needs. However, understanding the difference between upskilling and reskilling training programmes is vital to delivering training that develops the teachers' capabilities. Lay Description: What is already known about this topic: The emergence of remote teaching during the pandemic caused several gaps due to the unprepared teachers to teach online.Upskilling is a long‐term resilience training that develops the teachers' capabilities.Teacher's digital competence requires applying complex and different strategies together. What this paper adds: The upskilling training programme develops the teachers' digital competence.Teachers exhibit a positive attitude towards using technology that supports collaboration, learning, and productivity to teach online.Teachers are skillful and prepared to overcome any unexpected challenges. Implications for practise and/or policy: Provide online, blended, and face‐to‐face upskilling training programmes for in‐service teachers according to the needs.Increase the presence of upskilling training programmes for in‐service teachers to develop their capabilities according to their needs.

        "In the Swedish educational system, there has been a recent push for digital technology in different school subjects. This paper investigates what regulates Swedish physical education teachers' perceptions of digital technology in outdoor education. The results is reflected in a number of rules that govern Swedish physical education teachers' perceptions and use of digital technology in outdoor education. Findings suggest that teachers' views on the relevance of digital technology in outdoor education depends partly on curriculum formulations, but of significant importance are also other factors such as: the addressed knowledge area, grade level, choice of digital device, needs of students, and teachers' ideological beliefs. These rules are discussed in relation to the construction of outdoor education as knowledge area within physical education and in relation to the ways in which Swedish physical education teachers relate to curriculum changes.

        "In Ireland, as with many international jurisdictions, digital technology is firmly positioned at the core of educational discourses. However, despite a rise in 'techno-positivity' among professionals in schools, these positive attitudes do not seem to permeate through to practice nor in effective learning outcomes. As a result, given the introduction of the Digital Learning Framework in the Irish schooling system, this study focuses on the initial experiences of those who lead the initiative within their respective schools and the contextual nuances they must navigate in the design of the enactment. This qualitative study comprised in-depth interviews with the Digital Learning Leaders of 10 different schools. Data evidenced the initial organisational considerations a leader must reckon with during the planning phase, and early indications of pedagogical impact, leading to a conclusion regarding contextual literacy. The research also highlights the subtle policy shift of embedding digital technologies within school evaluation mechanisms, heightening a sense of accountability associated with successful enactment.

        "This quasi-experimental study examined the effects of digital game-based learning (DGBL) on elementary-school students' Chinese language learning, self-efficacy and attention. In total, 126 fourth-graders participated in the study for 6 weeks. Two digital games with different mechanisms (completion-contingent and performance-contingent rewards) that integrated content from the fourth-grade Chinese language-arts curriculum were developed. Data on attention were collected from wearable electroencephalographic sensors while participants played the games. Students' playing behaviours were coded into five patterns. Students in the DGBL groups outperformed those in the control group in Chinese language-arts learning. Different game mechanisms had significant positive effects on children's attention and self-efficacy. The performance-contingent reward game significantly enhanced students' attention, and the completion-contingent reward game significantly enhanced their emotions and confidence in the Chinese language arts. The performance of more leaning behaviours in the DGBL environment was associated with higher Chinese language-arts achievement scores, especially among players with high levels of attention and self-efficacy during game play. These findings support the effectiveness of DGBL in enhancing students' Chinese language learning. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "Few studies have focused on the comparison between collaborative and individual digital game-based learning (DGBL) performance for students who study English as a Foreign Language (EFL). In collaborative DGBL, how the composition of foreign language anxiety (FLA) within groups of students affects students' performance remains uncertain. This study aimed to examine the effects of anxiety composition on DGBL performance of primary school students with different FLA levels to inform collaborative DGBL instruction. Ninety-six fifth-graders from four classes were identified as low, moderate, and high anxiety students according to Foreign Language Classroom Anxiety Scale (FLCAS). Two classes were randomly assigned into collaborative DGBL while the other two classes in individual DGBL. The students in the collaborative DGBL were further grouped into 12 heterogeneous groups with anxiety composition of Low & Moderate (LM), Low & High (LH), Moderate & High (MH), and Low, Moderate & High (LMH). Those in the individual DGBL underwent individual gameplay learning. It was found that either collaborative or individual DGBL effectively assisted the students to reduce their FLA. The results also showed that the students in the heterogeneous groups generally had better DGBL performance than those who worked individually. Particularly, groups with anxiety composition of LM outperformed those with LH, those with MH, and those with LMH. The study suggests group composition be considered a critical factor that may enhance students' learning with FLA in collaborative DGBL. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "Digital learning resources are commonly employed to support learning in out-of -class contexts, either as a complement to the learning informal classrooms or as an alternative that can be used by learners to pursue personal learning goals. This study identified a significant gap in the literature concerning children 's use of digital technology to support STEM(science and mathematics in particular) learning outside of the classroom. To develop a framework for further research in this area, this study adopted a multiple case study design using semi-structured interviews and observations as data collection methods. Following a sociocultural framework. this research primarily confirmed existing work regarding the identification of motivational factors and concluded that the user interface (UI). all-in-one features of digital technology, simulation and alternative learning experience were factors that influenced the learning motivation of secondary school- age learners when learning science and mathematics with digital technology in out-of -class contexts.

        "The Covid-19 outbreak caused transition from face-to-face teaching to Emergency Remote Teaching (ERT). Due to the hastily and disorganized implementation of ERT considerable difficulties were caused for all the students. Aim of the present study was to investigate (i) parents' views of students with functional diversity regarding ERT during the Covid-19 pandemic and (ii) how their children's functional diversity affected participation in ERT. ERT proved to be an even greater challenge for those students, who faced various learning, psychological and technical problems that further hindered the learning process. In the current research, the views of 12 parents of students with functional diversity were collected with semi-structured interviews. A Modern Greek dataset of qualitative humanistic-linguistic data was created. A novel type of data analysis, combining qualitative descriptive analysis by hand and Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based linguistic analysis was performed on the interview text. Results revealed (i) how those students responded to ERT, (ii) the way that their functional diversity affected their attendance on the online courses and (iii) how their parents evaluate the educational dimension of ERT along with any changes noticed in their children's psychological and emotional state. Parents' evaluations disclosed the overall negative impact of ERT on their children and presented their suggestions for meeting their children's special needs in case of ERT appliance in the future. The current research is considered significant as it investigates ERT impact on K-12 students with functional diversity during the Covid-19 pandemic, based on authentic humanistic data. Our research contributes on (i) the creation of this kind of dataset, as this particular group of students is hard to come by and their collection constitutes a significant contribution and (ii) the two-fold way data analysis methodology, which is novel, combining linguistic and qualitative processes (semantic and sentiment analysis), providing important findings.

        "Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to support self-regulated learning (SRL) because of its strong anthropomorphic characteristics. However, most studies of AI in education have focused on cognitive outcomes in higher education, and little research has examined how psychological needs affect SRL with AI in the K–12 setting. SRL is a self-directed process driven by psychological factors that can be explained by the three basic needs of self-determination theory (SDT), i.e., autonomy, competence, and relatedness. This study fills a research gap by examining the moderating effects of need satisfaction and gender in predicting SRL among Grade 9 students. The results indicate that girls perceive more need support than boys. In predicting SRL, satisfaction of the need for autonomy and competence is moderated by both gender and AI knowledge, whereas satisfaction of the need for relatedness is moderated by gender only. Particularly among girls, the effects of autonomy and competence more strongly predict SRL when AI knowledge is low. These findings confirm the gender differences in need satisfaction when predicting SRL with a chatbot. The findings have implications for both teacher instruction and the design and development of intelligent learning environments. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "Despite the increasing popularity of online learning in elementary and primary schools, it is unclear to which extent that students' attitudes toward online learning influence their learning progress and outcomes. In this study, the Online Learning Attitude Questionnaire (OLAQ) was developed and validated to measure students' online learning attitudes among 383 caregivers and 172 primary school students in Hong Kong. The caregiver data were analysed using exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis, and reliability analysis to establish the factor structure, reliability. and discriminant validity of the OLAQ questionnaire. The student data were analyzed using confirmatory factor analysis and reliability analysis to cross-validate the factor structure and confirm the reliability and discriminant validity of the OLAQ. The final 34-item OLAQ questionnaire comprises five subscales including (1) enjoyment, (2) development, (3) motivation, (4) utilization, and (5) anxiety. These results indicate that the OLAQ is a valid and reliable instrument for assessing primary school students' attitudes toward online learning. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "In the previous study the work experience on organization of teaching Robotics to secondary school students at school lessons and in study groups was introduced. This study which was conducted within 2019 and 2021 covered the period of distant learning caused by COVID-19 pandemic and even post-pandemic period, when a part of school students continued learning online. The study deals with the problem of developing school students' computational thinking in online learning. We consider computational thinking as a set of cognitive skills of solving educational and cognitive problems. The research questions raised were aimed at solving the problem of the influence of Educational Robotics on developing computational thinking. During the research we have found out that due to the adaptability of robots, Educational Robotics, the development of individual learning programs, and the arrangement of collaborative online learning are instruments and a solution to the problem of developing computational thinking. The main components of computational thinking, which were studied within those 3 years, are the following: algorithmic thinking, ability to program, and efficiency in team work. The influence of the learning strategy we chose enabled us to determine the level of computational thinking and its dependence on learning Robotics. We used statistical criteria in order to summarize the results of our research. The statistics provided suggests progress in the indicator tracked. Based on the experimental data received we approximated reliability (R2) and relevant exponential equation (trend lines). The research we carried out also has led to the general conclusion that Educational Robotics helps to create synergistic learning environment for stimulating students' motivation, collaboration, self-efficacy and creativity.

        "Background: Dialogic engagement is instrumental in promoting higher‐order thinking, motivation, and learning. Despite their dramatic uptake in the US in the past decade, there is limited evidence that online high school courses offer sufficient opportunities for students to communicate and collaborate with teachers and peers. Objectives: This two‐part study explores teacher perspectives and the experiences of students in online learning environments to determine if, how, and why students engage in two forms of dialogic engagement–academic discourse and peer collaboration. Methods: To identify the extent to which teachers perceive academic discourse and peer collaboration to be valuable and feasible in online learning environments, Study 1 surveyed educators and advisors of online learning programs (n = 49). To determine whether these perspectives align with student experiences, Study 2 included a series of over‐the‐shoulder observations of five high school students engaging in their online coursework. Results and Conclusions: Findings reveal a disconnect between best practices in education and reality. Online teachers report that academic discourse is valuable and feasible, but also detail several challenges to successful implementation in online coursework. At the same time, direct observations of high school students indicate that they rarely, if ever, engage in peer collaboration and academic discourse activities. Major Takeaways: Although valued as a means to improve educational outcomes, opportunities for dialogic engagement are not translating to online learning environments. The solution is to develop curriculum, policies, and procedures that centre on meaningful integration of dialogic activities, motivating students to engage. Lay Description: What is currently known: Academic discourse and peer collaboration work in tandem to support dialogic learning.Dialogic engagement promotes higher‐order thinking, motivation, and learning.Online learning environments can be tailored to support dialogic engagement. What this article adds: Online teachers value academic discourse and peer collaboration.Teachers cite implementation challenges due to logistics and lack of student engagement.The online curriculum offers limited opportunities for academic discourse and peer collaboration.Students see little value in these interactive activities, and opt out when given the option. Implications for practitioners: Online curriculum should meaningfully integrate dialogic activities to promote higher order thinking.Policies should mandate academically challenging learning to make student and teacher engagement meaningful.Educators can enhance student motivation to engage through appropriate scaffolding and ease of access. Although valued as a means to improve educational outcomes, opportunities for dialogic engagement are not translating to online learning environments. The solution is to develop curriculum, policies, and procedures that centre on meaningful integration of dialogic activities, motivating students to engage. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "The adoption of online learning for adolescent students accelerated with the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, few studies have investigated the mechanisms influencing adolescent students' online learning engagement systematically and comprehensively. This study applied the Presage-Process-Product (3P) model of learning to investigate the direct effects of presage factors (i.e., information literacy and self-directed learning skills) and process factors (i.e., academic emotions) on high school students' online learning engagement; and the mediating role of process factors. Data from 1993 high school students in China (49.3% males and 50.7% females) were analyzed using structural equation modeling. The result showed that students' information literacy, self-directed learning skills, and positive academic emotions positively predicted their online learning engagement. Moreover, the positive impact of self-directed learning skills on students' online learning engagement was significantly and largely enhanced through the mediation effects of positive academic emotions (β = 0.606, 95% CI = [0.544, 0.674]). Based on these results, to enhance adolescent students' online learning engagement, it is important for school administrators, teachers, and parents to improve students' information literacy, self-directed learning skills, and positive academic emotions.

        "Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) require long-term interventions with professional tutors. In this paper, we explore the design space of virtual tutors in digital learning systems that may facilitate effective ASD interventions. We conducted a classroom observational study to examine how children with ASD learn and interact with tutors, organized a design workshop with the children to understand their visual preferences for virtual tutors, and held a focus group with tutors and individual interviews with parents to investigate their teaching methods, techniques, and challenges at school and at home. We identified three types of interactions and five types of learning behaviors in children with ASD. We also found tutors and parents followed a structured training approach and often used personalized rewards to mediate the intervention. Based on previous research and our empirical results, we proposed 12 design considerations for designing virtual tutors' visual, audio, kinesthetic, and interaction features. We also presented a design case for developing a virtual tutor in a language learning app to help children with ASD learn social communication skills. We conclude with a discussion of the advantages and challenges of designing and employing virtual tutors in educational contexts for children with ASD. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "The COVID‐19 pandemic led to the closure of higher educational institutions (HEIs) and affected the teaching learning processes in educational institutions of all levels. The pandemic increased the digital gap of the existing minimal Internet connectivity and access to digital technology. As a result of the impact of the pandemic on education, HEIs in Ghana moved from traditional face‐to‐face classes to remote education or hybrid learning. Therefore, it is important to understand how digital technologies and digital divide influenced teaching and learning in sub‐Saharan Africa. Thus, the purpose of this research was to investigate the strategies universities in Ghana used to overcome the digital divide during the COVID‐19 pandemic. The study also aimed to explore the challenges and experiences of dealing with the digital divide during the pandemic. Data were collected following a qualitative research design. Thirty‐five in‐depth and semi‐structured interviews (25 teaching faculty and 10 administrators) from two private and three public universities were obtained and analysed via thematic analysis approach. Findings were thematized by challenges of dealing with digital divide during the COVID‐19 pandemic, provision of affordable Internet connectivity for students, faculty and staff, use of digital technologies and resources for hybrid and remote courses, creation of information communication and technology platforms for students, faculty and administrators, and provision of professional development workshops/trainings on digital skills and knowledge. These results were discussed with the three‐level model of the digital divide framework (school, classroom and student) and the development history of digital infrastructure in sub‐Saharan Africa. By analysing the Ghana HEIs' experiences, this study contributes to a balanced understanding of the digital divide issue during the COVID‐19 pandemic. Practitioner notesWhat is already known about this topic The COVID‐19 pandemic has led to the closure of higher educational institutions (HEIs) worldwide, including those in sub‐Saharan Africa, and changed learning and teaching process to remote learning in higher education.There is dearth of studies regarding how digital technologies and digital divide influenced teaching and learning progress during the COVID‐19 pandemic in sub‐Saharan Africa. Lack of understanding about the strategies universities in Africa (Ghana) used to overcome the digital divide during the COVID‐19 pandemic.What this paper adds This study, unlike earlier ones with a similar focus, investigated the strategies higher education institutions in Ghana in sub‐Saharan Africa used to overcome digital divide during the COVID‐19 pandemic.The results show the following: evidence of students lack of access to affordable Internet bandwidth, adoption of remote education, using digital technologies for hybrid and remote courses, creation of ICT platforms for instructors and students, trainings on digital skills for instructors and students, and challenges of dealing with digital divide during the COVID‐19 pandemic.Implications for practice and/or policy The paper identifies the instructional strategies HEIs in Ghana used to address and reduce the challenges of digital divide during the COVID‐19 pandemic.The findings were theoretically analysed under a three‐level model of the digital divide in education, proving the utility of this comprehensive approach. Then, they were interpreted concerning the development history of sub‐Saharan Africa to reduce the discursive unbalance in the digital divide studies.The paper makes detailed recommendations on how HEIs can address the effects of digital divide on teaching and learning experience during future disruptions and increase the use of digital technologies and ICT tools in remote/hybrid and or distance learning environment in sub‐Saharan Africa.

        "Using digital learning content to realize learning in games is a rapidly-developing direction of interest for teachers and researchers. This study has developed a digital role-playing gaming system to review Social Studies course content to a fifth Grade class at an elementary school. It allows students to experience the historical storyline of Tamsui, located in the north of Taiwan, by playing the role of Dr. Mackay. An experiment was conducted to evaluate the potential effects of the proposed system when applied to the reviewing activity of Humanities courses. The results of the post-test scores showed that the proposed system is not superior to the traditional teaching method which uses PowerPoint-based slides with the teacher's oral instruction, but it still enhances their overall learning performance after the reviewing activity. Moreover, the results of the questionnaire survey showed that the students who reviewed by using the proposed system showed a higher learning motivation than those reviewing with the traditional teaching method. It is therefore concluded that our role-playing digital gaming system can be used to assist the teachers' teaching activities, because it allows the students to complete their reviewing activity by themselves, and it effectively enhances their learning performances and motivation.

        "The purpose of this study was to deploy digital technology in ways that would help mathematics teachers in a remote rural Taiwanese middle school construct a differentiated classroom aligned with students' needs. We attempted to develop seventh-grade mathematics course modules that could meet quality educational requirements and equal opportunities for customized learning by empowering teachers through instructional coaching. Mixed methods were used to collect relevant qualitative and quantitative data from 4 mathematics teachers, 3 instructional coaches, and 16 students. Analysis of the findings reveals that instructional coaching contributes to teacher engagement and transformation for implementing differentiated strategies. The results also indicate the perceptions of the participating students in their learning motivation, anxiety, attitude, classroom interaction, and acceptance of technology. Based on the results of this study, pedagogical implications and future research directions are discussed regarding how instructional coaching can be executed to leverage professional development while preparing mathematics teachers for the improved interaction and involvement of ethnically and socioeconomically diverse students.

        "While there has been an upsurge in transition to online learning taking place mostly in higher education, many countries around the world have had to leave their brick-and-mortar schools all of a sudden and necessarily turn to fully-online education since the outbreak of Coronavirus pandemic (Covid-19). Such global emergency cases reacquaint us with the fact that education cannot be taken for granted, making the findings of the current research literature inevitable and ready for immediate use for future policy-making regarding online education. Thus, we planned to conduct the present research synthesis including more recent empirical studies of both a quantitative and qualitative character. We took a multi-complementary approach including a meta-analysis together with a meta-thematic analysis of the effectiveness of online education. In order to further complement and consolidate the results of these two reviews of previous studies, we conducted a mixed-methods research (a pre-experimental study and a qualitative study) designed specifically to understand the responses from the abrupt transition period of online education. This kind of research approach is believed to make more contributions to the relevant literature as it may provide a more in-depth perusal of the impacts of online learning on and its effectiveness in student achievement.

        "Professional learning (PL) for inclusion is a key policy focus internationally, arising from a growing commitment to the goal of a rights-based approach to education for all. Transformative teacher PL for inclusion is paramount to this goal but it is a complex endeavour, as evidenced in the persistent knowledge-practice gap relating to inclusive practice. Models of collaborative inquiry hold promise for affecting teacher change, yet there is limited research on how such models can support quality teacher PL for inclusion. This qualitative cross-case analysis focuses on two models of collaborative inquiry in different contexts in the Republic of Ireland (RoI): a professional learning community (PLC) for inclusive practice in a primary school and an online learning community (OLC) that supported preservice teacher learning during school placement. Parallel findings across the two case studies demonstrated changes in participants' beliefs, efficacy and practice, arising from collaborative inquiry that was characterised by critical dialogue and public sharing of work. External facilitation of the learning communities supported the creation of a 'safe space' which was paramount to transforming PL contexts. We proffer design principles for sustainable collaborative PL approaches across teacher education contexts that support teachers to navigate the complexity of enacting inclusive practice.

        "The proliferation and increasing application of modern technology have led to the improvement of tactics used to teach to play guzheng, the Chinese national instrument. This study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of using MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses) for this purpose to argue on the possibility of reforming guzheng instruction in Chinese schools. The basis of this investigation was represented by a specially developed MOOC and an online survey. Verification of the collected data was made by means of Fisher's exact test. As research participants, 88 seventh graders and 10 teachers from three schools in China (China, Taiyuan, Jinzhong) were invited. The time frame this study covered was from February to June of the 2020-2021 academic year. The outcomes obtained from the conducted experiment indicate that the lowest grades were obtained by students who took traditional guzheng lessons and did not take advantage of online learning (71.1, 72.9, and 73.0 for each institution, with an average of 72.3). At the same time, the results of respondents who were additionally involved in the dedicated MOOC were notably higher: 78.8, 78.1, and 79.2, with an average of 78.7 (8.1% better). These data show that the use of modern technology when teaching students to play guzheng is effective. The outcomes of the survey on students' impressions from the proposed learning course and its usefulness revealed that 98% of all the persons involved were satisfied with their participation in the MOOC. Students showed high support for the statements claiming MOOC's positive impact on teachers' intercultural professionalism in guzheng teaching and overall approach to instruction. The practical and scientific significance of this study resides in the fact that it demonstrates the effectiveness of modern technology, particularly distance learning platforms, in the context of guzheng learning. This paper demonstrates clearly that through the use of additional multimedia, better results can be achieved. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "With the recent outbreak of coronavirus disease, people are advised to keep social distance. Schools are closed and people work from home. Some community research has had to be suspended to prevent the spread of the disease. Researchers have had to think of ways to deliver and continue their studies. With a large coverage of networks and the availability of electric devices, online delivery is a possible solution. In this article, the experience of conducting an online pain management programme is used to illustrate how the strategies and elements of online learning can be adopted to the conducting of research. Self-paced learning, learner control and self-directed learning are the approaches adopted in the online pain management programme and generated a positive learning experience. The difficulties encountered in the research process including the observation of the participants' performance and reactions, are discussed, and the solutions devised by the research team are offered as an example.

        "Interest is the basic driver of a person is doing something to achieve his goals, and in action-reaction theory, the measure that is widely used is attitude. Through behavioral intention to adopt, we examined its effect on online learning interest using perceived usefulness (PU), perceived ease of use (PEOU) and self-efficacy (SE). In addition, the moderation of family social background and perceived parental involvement influence the initial construction of adoption intentions towards interest. We tested the proposed test on high school students, and the results showed that perceived usefulness was found to be the most prominent factor in shaping adoption intentions followed by ease of use, but not self-efficacy. Adoption of technology makes students study hard because they feel that learning applications are important for their education, besides that, social background has a medium effect, and parental involvement has a small/medium effect. The implications and framework of future research are also discussed in this study. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "Basic Psychological Needs (BPN) in blended learning has become a crucial precursor in promoting the harmony of competence, relatedness and autonomy for both traditional and online learning approaches. This mixed study aims to investigate in-service teachers' and learners' perspectives of BPN fulfillment and its issues under the context of blended professional training. A total of 60 in-service teachers and 120 secondary school students from 24 provinces in Indonesia participated in the study. Construct validity of the questionnaire was established using exploratory factor analysis. Findings using the non-parametric Mann–Whitney U test showed no significant differences between in-service teachers' and learners' perspectives of the in-service teachers' BPN. Learners believed that the in-service teachers' fulfillment of relatedness and competence was low in connecting to other people using IT, online care, online teachers' adornment, and learning new skills. The interview with both groups of participants depicted that in some points, the learners perceived that their in-service teachers BPN of relatedness made them unsatisfied with low online care, empathy, and massive online tasks. Suggestion to harmonize these issues and their pedagogical implications for the second language (L2) curriculum and teacher training program in Indonesia and similar contexts were discussed.

        "This study compared the effect of two face-to-face(F2F) and e-learning education methods on learning, retention, and interest in English language courses. Participants were EFL students studying at Islamic Azad University, for the academic year 2021–2022. A multiple-stage cluster-sampling method was used to select the target participants. Three hundred and twenty EFL learners participated in the study. Students were studying in different majors: accounting, economics, psychology, physical education, law, management, and sociology. Two English tests were applied, a teacher-made VTS (Vocabulary Size Test) and an achievement test (including reading comprehension and grammar questions). Also, a questionnaire was applied to measure the students' learning interest in F2F and online learning groups. The study found significant differences in learning outcomes related to students' English learning and vocabulary retention rates. It was seen that the E-learning group that participated in online sessions through the Learning Management Systems (LMS) platform outperformed the F2F group. Another critical finding revealed that learners' interest in learning English in E-learning classes was higher than in the F2F group. In addition, all constructs of interest (feeling happy, attention, interest, and participation) were higher in scores in the E-learning than in the F2F group. Language teachers, university instructors, educators, syllabus designers, school administrators, and policymakers might rethink their teaching approaches and incorporate E-learning into the curriculum to meet their students' needs.

        "In today's rapidly changing job market, digital competence is quickly becoming a requirement for employability. This has put pressure on the next generation, particularly digital natives, to be well-equipped to deal with the turbulence of technology. This paper aims to compare youth's pre-course and post-course digital competency levels and examine students' perceptions of their employability after taking digital-skills-related courses. The Penang government initiative of an online learning program named \"Penang Young Digital Talent Program\" is designed to foster digital competencies. The program comprises online courses such as web design, digital marketing, etc. Therefore, the current study has examined the current level of Penag youth's digital readiness and digital competency (survey 1, N = 662) and the evaluate program's effectiveness while determining the impact of course quality on perceived employability (survey 2, N = 385) students undergo. The participants of this program range from 18–30 years old (post-secondary school and graduates), who are either born in Penang or have resided in Penang for a minimum of 3 years. The participants reported that their digital competency improved after participating in the talent program. The results of Smart PLS reported that course quality has a significant and positive relationship with perceived employability. Moreover, there is an indirect impact of student satisfaction and course effectiveness on the perceived employability of Malaysian youth. These findings have implications for educational policymakers who should prioritize young people acquiring digital skills to compete in the modern labor market. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "Online gamification is an innovative educational practice, yet little is known about how the socio-material imbrications entailed in this pedagogical approach influence educator professional identities. Adopting a social-material sensibility to examine lecturer professional identities, this qualitative study mobilises visual-elicitation interviews and observations to understand the nuanced lecturer identity positions emanating from Kahoot! gamified practice in a Middle East college. Following a socio-material narrative analysis, the imbrication of people and Kahoot! reveals four distinct identity positionings underpinned by the material affordances and constraints of gamification. This study contributes to the growing body of research into how subject positions are manifested through the imbrications of human actors and materiality, revealing that the enactment of Kahoot! is not a neutral process, but one which may have transformative effects for lecturer professional identities in the higher education gamification context.

        "Digital technology has become central to how adolescents explore their developing sexuality and form relationships with peers, including romantic and sexual relationships. Interviews with 110 high school and college students in the Northeastern USA identified how digitally mediated communication is a fundamental part of adolescent flirtation practices, with young people making use of digital affordances to mitigate the interpersonal risks associated with flirtation. The 'screen' is seen as a protective barrier against the emotional vulnerability and embarrassment that can occur during in-person flirtation. Gender and sexual minority youth also appreciate how digitally mediated intimacy protects them from threats to physical safety in a hetero-patriarchal world. By contrast, adults perceive cell phones and social media as sites of risk for young people. Teenagers are portrayed in the media as the hapless victims of technology rather than agentic creators of digital sexual cultures. Their digital interactions, especially when sexual in nature, are highly regulated and subject to social control. This focus on technological risk blinds educators to exploring the ways in which new technology is integrated into adolescents' socio-sexual lives. To be effective, school-based sex education must engage creatively with the role of digitally mediated communication in adolescents' romantic and sexual lives. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "Recent years have seen a sharp increase in the transition from traditional teaching methods to online distance teaching and learning in all educational institutions including schools and higher education institutions. This change means that student-teachers need to have online learning experience and acquire professional skills needed to become online distance teachers. In the last two decades, research has investigated various aspects of online teaching but a main subject which has not been studied in depth is the learners' feeling of belonging in an online distance course, especially among student-teachers. The research investigated the contribution of student-teachers' self-perceived readiness for learning online and a collaborative online learning environment to the learners' sense of belonging. For this purpose, quantitative and qualitative data were gathered from pre- and post-tests and personal and collaborative blogs from 172 student-teachers' studying in two large teacher-education colleges in the center of Israel, to measure their self-perceived readiness for online collaborative learning, their sense of belonging and the learning experiences and changes they underwent along the course. It was found that a student-teacher, who had previously enjoyed a good experience in a collaborative online course, and had strong technological literacy for online learning, performed better in an online course, operated optimally in collaborative task performance, and felt a strong sense of belonging to the group at the course's end. These findings can inform future teacher training, the formation of new pedagogic models and teaching methods for collaborative online environments and their implementation in teaching-learning.

        "Innovations in higher music education are a way of reasonable use of information and communication technologies that increase interactivity and facilitate classroom learning. The study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of introducing the application aimed at improving the skill of sheet music reading. Using a mobile app to enhance the perception of music education is a relevant innovation in a large number of educational institutions. The hypothesis was that a three-month premium subscription to Complete Music Reading Trainer would improve student performance in the Multiple-Choice Questions test from AP Music Theory Practice Exam. The control and experimental groups consisted of 50 first-year pianists each from the College of Music of Xinjiang Normal University, China, whose average age was 18.7 years. The experimental group used the application not only in the classroom but also outside the educational institution while following the application program. The test results were compared with the help of the Student's t test. The average value in the experimental group was 60.88 points out of 75, which exceeds the control group indicator by 14.55 points (on average, a pianist scored 46.34 points there). The difference in the mean values across the groups turned out to be statistically significant (p = 0.000), and the t-criterion value was negative (t = −7.858). This demonstrates the effectiveness of a three-month use of a mobile application for reading sheet music. Thus, the research hypothesis was confirmed. The research results partially coincide with the findings of similar scientific studies. However, there is a small number of such publications that can promote further discussion. The study will be useful to anyone who is interested in an interactive learning environment in the field of higher music education or just wants to use a mobile phone for professional self-improvement while studying.

        "Evidence from various domains underlines the critical role that human factors, and especially trust, play in adopting technology by practitioners. In the case of Artificial Intelligence (AI) powered tools, the issue is even more complex due to practitioners' AI‐specific misconceptions, myths and fears (e.g., mass unemployment and privacy violations). In recent years, AI has been incorporated increasingly into K‐12 education. However, little research has been conducted on the trust and attitudes of K‐12 teachers towards the use and adoption of AI‐powered Educational Technology (AI‐EdTech). This paper sheds light on teachers' trust in AI‐EdTech and presents effective professional development strategies to increase teachers' trust and willingness to apply AI‐EdTech in their classrooms. Our experiments with K‐12 science teachers were conducted around their interactions with a specific AI‐powered assessment tool (termed AI‐Grader) using both synthetic and real data. The results indicate that presenting teachers with some explanations of (i) how AI makes decisions, particularly compared to the human experts, and (ii) how AI can complement and give additional strengths to teachers, rather than replacing them, can reduce teachers' concerns and improve their trust in AI‐EdTech. The contribution of this research is threefold. First, it emphasizes the importance of increasing teachers' theoretical and practical knowledge about AI in educational settings to gain their trust in AI‐EdTech in K‐12 education. Second, it presents a teacher professional development program (PDP), as well as the discourse analysis of teachers who completed it. Third, based on the results observed, it presents clear suggestions for future PDPs aiming to improve teachers' trust in AI‐EdTech. Practitioner notesWhat is already known about this topic Human factors, and especially trust, play a critical role in practitioners' adoption of technology.In recent years, AI has been incorporated increasingly into K‐12 education.Little research has been conducted on the trust and attitudes of K‐12 teachers towards the use and adoption of AI‐powered Educational Technology.What this paper adds This research emphasizes the importance of increasing teachers' theoretical and practical knowledge about AI in educational settings to gain their trust in AI‐EdTech in K‐12 education.It presents a teacher professional development program (PDP) to increase teachers' trust in AI‐EdTech, as well as the discourse analysis of teachers who completed it.It presents clear suggestions for future PDPs aiming at improving teachers' trust in AI‐EdTech.Implications for practice and/or policy Pre‐ and in‐service teacher education programs that aim to increase teachers' trust in AI‐EdTech should include a section providing teachers with a basic understanding of AI.PDPs aimed to increase teachers' trust in AI‐EdTech should focus on concrete pedagogical tasks and specific AI‐powered tools that are considered by teachers as helpful and worth the effort to learn.AI‐EdTech should not restrict teachers to follow specific pedagogical scenarios, but rather provide teachers with the freedom to design and implement various types of pedagogies that meet their preferences, students' needs, and classroom reality.Teacher agency is key to gaining their trust. AI‐EdTech should allow teachers to review, modify, and if necessary, override AI‐based recommendations before they are sent to students. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "Artificial Intelligence is widely used across contexts and for different purposes, including the field of education. However, a review of the literature showcases that while there exist various review studies on the use of AI in education, missing remains a review focusing on science education. To address this gap, we carried out a systematic literature review between 2010 and 2021, driven by three questions: a) What types of AI applications are used in school science? b) For what teaching content are AI applications in school science used? and, c) What is the impact of AI applications on teaching and learning of school science? The studies reviewed (n = 22) included nine different types of AI applications: automated assessment, automated feedback, learning analytics, adaptive learning systems, intelligent tutoring systems, multilabel text classification, chatbot, expert systems, and mind wandering detection. The majority of the AI applications are used in geoscience or physics and AI applications are used to support either knkowledge construction or skills development. In terms of the impact of AI applications, this is found across the following: learning achievement, argumentation skills, learning experience, and teaching. Missing remains an examination of learners' and teachers' experiences with the use of AI in school science, interdisciplinary approaches to AI implementation, as well as an examination of issues related to ethics and biases.

        "This article reports on a study exploring Greek K–12 teachers' views and beliefs about emergency remote teaching. A survey was conducted just after schools reopened on May 2020 and 694 teachers participated. The findings indicated that the majority of the participants conceptualised the pandemic as a turning point with regards to the role of digital technologies in schools. Exploratory factor analysis revealed four major factors that affected online instruction during the COVID-19 pandemic: a) teachers' abilities to design online learning activities; b) teachers' professional development needs; c) impact of the pandemic on education; and d) teachers' pedagogical conceptions of online learning. Qualitative data analysis revealed that teachers' pedagogical skills, in terms of organising effective online learning environments and implementing e-learning interventions in K–12 classrooms, were the key factors for successful online instruction during the pandemic and beyond.

        "Artificial intelligence (AI) provides new opportunities for K-12 English as foreign language (EFL) teachers to improve their teaching. To address the emerging trend of integrating AI into teaching, this study investigated EFL teachers' perceptions, knowledge, and behavioral intention to use AI to support teaching and learning of English in middle schools. This study combined relevant aspects of the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) and Technological Pedagogical and Content Knowledge (TPACK) as the theoretical basis. A survey was conducted in an AI education demonstration district in China. This survey adopted a 5-point Likert scale which was developed from previous research and the interview records of EFL teachers. A total of 470 valid responses were collected. The reliability and validity of the scale were satisfied with eight constructs: Performance Expectancy (PE), Effort Expectancy (EE), Social Influence (SI), Facilitating Conditions (FC), AI language technological knowledge (AIL-TK), AI technological pedagogical knowledge (AI-TPK), AI-TPACK, and Behavioral Intention (BI). The results showed that the EFL teachers were positive with regard to the measured factors. PE, SI, AIL-TK, and AI-TPACK had significant positive predictive power on BI; and EE, FC, AI-TPK had indirect effects on BI. The complex interrelations were mapped out to provide educators and policymakers with a theoretically grounded scheme to foster teachers' BI to use AI in teaching. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "Adaptive learning support is a key element of high quality preschool education and includes the planning of learning situations and teacher–child interactions. The provision of effective adaptive learning support in kindergarten is challenging. This longitudinal experimental study examined the impact of two professional development programs on 132 kindergarten teachers. One program focused on teacher–child interactions (micro-adaptive learning support), the other on planning, preparation, and reflection (macro-adaptive learning support). Each program had a positive impact on the quality of the specific type of adaptive mathematical learning support provided by kindergarten teachers, macro or micro, it was designed to improve.

        "Asynchronous online learning has gained great popularity in higher education, especially due to the recent COVID-19 pandemic. However, few studies have investigated how to maintain students' continuous usage intention of asynchronous online courses in the context of higher education. This study incorporated four key factors (intrinsic motivation, extrinsic motivation, perception of multiple sources, and cognitive engagement) associated with students' continuous usage intention of asynchronous online courses into technology acceptance model (TAM) to identify the influencing factors on students' continuous usage intention. A survey with 325 college students was conducted to explore their continuous usage intention of asynchronous online courses and structural equation modeling analysis was carried out to analyze the relationships between the key influencing factors and students' continuous usage intention. The results showed that cognitive engagement was the only factor that directly related to continuous usage intention. Intrinsic motivation, extrinsic motivation, and perception of multiple sources indirectly correlated with students' continuous usage intention through different pathways. The results of the study have several theoretical and practical implications. Theoretically, the study verified what key learning factors incorporated into TAM and in what way they relate to the continuous usage intention of asynchronous online courses. Practically, the present study indicated that it is required to take intrinsic motivation, extrinsic motivation, perception of multiple sources, cognitive engagement and TAM into consideration when designing and conducting asynchronous online learning courses to ensure college students' continuous usage intention of asynchronous online courses.

        "In 2001, the Chinese Ministry of Education issued Guidelines for Preschool Education (GPE) (trial version) to call on early childhood practitioners to use a child-centred and play-based approach to teaching and learning. In order to implement the requirements, many kindergartens in China have carried out the play-based kindergarten curriculum reform. Among them, there are three successful trial cases in China on putting play as the core and base activity in kindergarten. They are Anji play in Zhejiang province (south east China), Lijin play in Shandong Province (east China) and Gamification of the curriculum in Jiangsu Province (east China). All the kindergartens there whether private or public start to change the old group teaching and return play to young children. The similarities of three play modes are: open and constantly changing play environment, adequate play time, multiple teachers' roles and child-centred play evaluation. Play-based curriculum in these three cases are top-down reform, which is the most effective way in China. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "Due to the effects of the COVID-19 crisis on educational institutions, schools had to close and switch to online education. Training in-service teachers to incorporate and utilize technology as part of Internet-based instructions was a challenge and pressing necessity. TPACK is an essential framework for comprehending how teachers employ technology in teaching. Despite the significance of adaptive learning environments in recent years, research has not addressed how to use these environments to improve the TPACK of in-service teachers, particularly during crises. Consequently, our objective was to design an adaptive learning environment that provides in-service math, science, and English teachers with substantial and continuing support for each TPACK component. A total of 173 in-service teachers were divided into two groups: an experimental group of 83 who used adaptive learning and a control group of 90 who used Zoom techniques. TPACK questionnaires were administered before and after the experiment. The experimental group improved TPACK more than the control group. All teachers believed that adaptive learning training helped them to build technology-integrated lesson plans. This study provides ideas and practices for developing an adaptive learning environment for the in-service teachers' TPACK development. The challenges to adaptive learning environments have been highlighted, identifying the potential for future investigations. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, courses in higher education have increasingly been delivered via asynchronous online modalities. Although such modalities may allow instructors and students greater flexibility in how they engage with their courses, they increase the self-regulatory challenges learners experience. Students may feel less capable of regulating their learning in web-based modalities, which may increase procrastination and lower academic performance. Alternatively, students who procrastinate in their asynchronous courses may become convinced that they lack the self-regulatory skills needed to succeed. Little research has examined these relationships. The purpose of this mixed methods study was to examine these self-regulatory processes, the challenges students experience in asynchronous classes, and possible effects on academic performance. Undergraduate students (N = 1,216) attending a public U.S. university responded to closed – and open-ended survey items in Fall 2020. A cross-lagged panel model revealed the interdependency of self-efficacy for self-regulation and academic procrastination, and their relationship with course performance. Findings suggest that students' beliefs in their self-regulatory capabilities and their procrastination behaviors are related to each other and jointly contribute to course performance. Students described time management difficulties as the most challenging aspect of asynchronous online learning. Integration of quantitative and qualitative data revealed several unique challenges experienced by students who had relatively higher or lower self-efficacy and procrastination. Overall, this study suggests implications for the timely support of college students' self-regulation in asynchronous online learning courses during and after COVID-19. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "Online learning provides a variety of benefits to the educational experience, including accessibility and flexibility, but is often limited in terms of peer-to-peer interactions and relationship development. Using media richness theory as a guiding framework, this study extended prior research to determine the impact of using richer channels in a fast-friendship task on feelings of co-presence and social connection among undergraduate students in online courses. Participants (N = 106) were assigned to one of three conditions (text, phone or video) for the fast-friendship task, which took place over the course of nine weeks. The results revealed that there was no indirect effect of channel richness on social connection through co-presence. Additionally, the direct effects of channel richness on co-presence and co-presence on social connection were not significant. These null findings have theoretical and practical implications for understanding media richness in online learning and improving course design among contemporary college students.

        "This paper reports on a study conducted by college students at a private university in Saudi Arabia. The research examines the online learning experiences of their peers during the first wave of the coronavirus covid-19 pandemic. Many assumptions exist about online learning and its impact in higher education, but these are mainly based on the views of instructors and leaders of institutions. Hitherto, the perspectives of those meant to be beneficiaries of digital technologies have been given little consideration even though students use cyberspace for academic work and beyond. To address this silence, a group of student-researchers conducted a case study to examine students' views of cyberlearning. The research used a qualitative analysis approach to address the following questions: (1) What were the cyberlearning experiences of students at our university during the first two semesters of lockdown? (2) What are students' understandings of cyberlearning? (3) What are their aspirations for cyberlearning? Data were collected through an online survey administered to the entire student body at the university. Responses were received from 3574 students. The data were analysed using thematic analysis. The research participants perceive cyberlearning to be the same as online learning and see it as a viable educational option. They reported that the dominant mode of instruction in online classrooms is instructors delivering information. Respondents also highlighted the need for improved online teaching pedagogies and curbing academic dishonesty in online classrooms. Students' aspirations for cyberlearning were clearly articulated. Respondents suggested that increasing online learning opportunities would have a positive impact on their academic progress. Through this research students demonstrate a sense of agency and provide opportunities for equity strategies at their university. The results show that serious attempts should be made to include cyberlearning as part of everyday educational activity in an attempt to increase student engagement. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "The rapid growth of diverse learners in online learning has made it imperative for online instructors to incorporate multicultural resource curricula and instructional activities. This research aimed to explore online instructors' perceptions of culturally responsive pedagogy in online education; examine how instructors integrate culturally responsive pedagogy strategies in the online learning environment; and explore the challenges in facilitating cross‐cultural collaborative learning for students from different cultural backgrounds. Data were collected following a qualitative multi‐site case study method with five academic disciplines (Education, Social Sciences, Engineering, Physical Sciences and Health Sciences) in 12 colleges and universities in the United States of America. In all, 60 in‐depth and semi‐structured interviews with instructors (26 females and 34 males) were obtained and analysed following a constant comparative analysis approach. Results reflected that the instructors used cross‐cultural interactions to facilitate students' engagement and incorporated culturally responsive teaching. Besides, the findings revealed that most of the instructors integrated diverse and internationalized learning content to support diverse students and addressed the impact of multicultural education in online learning. It was, however, noted, that instructors in the physical science disciplines struggled to incorporate culturally diverse contents in their online classes. The findings of this study foster discourse on how best instructors could be aided to engage diverse students online more meaningfully. Practitioner notesWhat is already known about this topicSince studies of this nature are mostly undertaken in teaching and learning environments that are diverse in terms of student populations, both students and instructors are exposed to cultural differences in teaching and learning in multicultural/diverse online learning environments.Studies on multicultural/diverse online learning environments abound and have been undertaken for several years but the emphasis has mainly been to explore issues from the perspectives of students.Most online instructors assume that online learning provides equal opportunities to all students regardless of their cultural backgrounds and cultural differences; hence, instructors have mostly not been able to recognize cultural implications for students' learning to design inclusive instructional strategies to meet the learning needs of diverse students in online education.What this paper addsThis study, unlike earlier ones with a similar focus, explored online instructors' perceptions of culturally responsive pedagogy (CRP), specifically with regards to the design, preparation and integration of multicultural learning contents and resources in online education.This study employed Scott et al.'s (2015) culturally responsive computing theory as a lens to connect students' prior learning experiences, knowledge, interests, strengths and weaknesses as a way to draw instructors' attention to how best diverse students can be aided to be innovative and succeed in the face of cross‐cultural challenges they face studying online.The study also contributes to the instructors' understanding of culturally responsive pedagogical principles in online spaces that recognize global identities and cultural experiences to meet the needs of diverse students in an online learning environment.Implications for practice and/or policyInstructors must develop online courses with the focus to bridge students' geographical and cultural backgrounds so that students will have the opportunity to share and connect with peers in online classrooms for effective collaboration and communication.Institutions that offer online education must make concerted efforts to provide continuous professional development opportunities for instructors of online courses on impacts of culture/diversity in the online classroom, and strategies for creating conducive online learning environments that value cultural differences, and social/educational experiences in ways that support students' learning.Institutions and stakeholders, through policy initiatives, should make frantic efforts to afford instructors with comprehensive knowledge and understanding of CRP in online learning to avoid the assumption that students in online courses share similar learning characteristics and bring to the online learning the same experiences and cultural backgrounds.

        "Background: The impact of mobile technology usage on student learning in various educational stages has been the subject of ongoing empirical and review research. The most recent meta‐analyses on various types of mobile technology use for potential benefits of learning covered the empirical studies up to about nine years ago. Since then, the use of mobile technology in primary and secondary education has increased tremendously, and numerous empirical studies have been conducted on this topic, but their conclusions were inconsistent. Objectives: The purpose of this systematic review is to re‐examine this issue by meta‐analyzing the empirical research studies from the last nine years, with a focus on cognitive, affective, and behavioral learning outcomes in primary and secondary education, and to examine the potential moderators that may have contributed to the heterogeneity across findings. Methods: Based on our inclusion and exclusion criteria, we found 85 studies of 78 peer‐reviewed papers (N = 9157) from electronic databases and major journals in educational technology and mobile learning between 2014 and 2022. We then examined 15 moderators that were expected to affect student learning outcomes. Results and Conclusions: Compared with traditional technology and non‐technology groups, using mobile technology produced medium positive and statistically significant effects on primary and secondary students' learning, in terms of cognitive (g = 0.498, 95% CI [0.382, 0.614]), affective (g = 0.449, 95% CI [0.301, 0.598]) and behavioural (g = 0.339, 95% CI [0.051, 0.627]) learning outcomes. Further moderator analyses revealed that student factors (i.e., community type, students' socioeconomic status), learning process (i.e., hardware used, student‐to‐hardware ratio, teaching method) and study quality (i.e., learning topic/content equivalence, degree of technology use in the control group) were among the variables that moderated the summary effect sizes for at least one learning outcome dimension significantly. The findings and their implications for researchers, policymakers and practitioners are discussed. Lay Description: What is already known about this topic: Mobile learning has become a fast‐growing research field.The benefits of mobile technology usage are related to learning outcomes.The pooled effects of mobile learning have been limited to cognitive learning. What this paper adds: This meta‐analysis focused on mobile learning versus traditional learning.The population was composed of students in primary and secondary education.Mobile technology usage contributed to higher cognitive, affective, and behavioural learning outcomes.Students from low socioeconomic backgrounds and rural areas benefited less from mobile technology interventions. Implications for practice and/or policy: Educational stakeholders need to take actions to adopt and support mobile technology usage in education.Mobile‐learning researchers need to optimize the quality of experimental studies.

        "Background: Creativity is an important ability for problem‐solving in both personal life and academic learning. Few creativity studies have investigated the development of children's creativity in disadvantaged rural areas or compared the rural–urban differences through digital game‐based creativity learning. Understanding such differences can help provide resources for promoting learning equality in creativity. Aims: This study aimed to compare the rural–urban difference in elementary school children's creativity performance and their learning effect through digital game‐based creativity learning. Sample: Participants were 261 3rd and 4th graders and 194 5th and 6th graders from 6 elementary schools. Method: Two digital game‐based creativity learning systems were employed to conduct a five‐class experimental instruction. A creativity test and a questionnaire were also used. Results and Conclusions: The results indicate that the urban middle graders, but not the upper graders, outperformed their rural counterparts in the creativity test before game‐based learning. Nevertheless, all children got a higher score on the creativity test after the game‐based learning, suggesting the employed creativity learning systems could be vehicles for improving elementary school children's creativity. However, the rural children gained less from the learning than the urban children, which may be due to weaker competencies in self‐regulated learning. Further studies can employ an inventory to verify this and also consider providing more scaffolding of self‐regulated learning to more disadvantaged students during digital game‐based creativity learning. Additionally, the results of this study reflect the importance of self‐determination and rewards in learning motivation. Appropriate rewards may encourage persistence in taking on challenges.

        "The present research examined the effect of digital role-playing game-based learning on high school students' critical thinking ability. Playing a digital game designed with RPG Maker and whose story lines featured critical thinking questions, a total of 32 high school student participants were given a learning context to practice critical thinking skills repeatedly. A quasi-experimental design was implemented to explore how students' performances in critical thinking skills and their learning motivation changed after participation in a four-day workshop camp. The results of the study showed that student participants achieved significant progress both in overall critical thinking performance and in learning motivation. Similar studies on the effectiveness of digital game-based learning on learning performance and learning motivation among students were also compared in lieu of the results of the present study. Both the quantitative and qualitative results of this study not only agreed with a majority of previous research findings on students' learning performance and learning motivation, but revealed some distinctive pedagogical qualities among different skills of critical thinking. Practical suggestions were also provided to help future studies and instructional designs of digital game-based learning achieve effective learning and enhance learning motivation among students.

        "Since the effectiveness of pedagogies relies heavily on the context they are practiced, scholars strive to revalidate them with different participants representing different disciplines, age, cultures and so on. In this regard, this piece of work was undertaken so as to reveal the impact of a digital game-based learning environment on the achievement of secondary school participants in the topic of Internet literacy in Turkey. To this end, a three dimensional multi-user digital game-based learning environment through Active Worlds game engine was created. The static-group pre-test post-test design was adopted. We recruited 266 students attending 10th-grade at a public high school. The participants were block-randomized to the groups. The control group partook in a lecture-based learning environment for two weeks, whereas the experimental group learned with a digital game-based learning environment. The results ascertained that even though there were significant learning gains in control as well as experimental groups, no substantial significant difference was observed in the achievement across the groups. The results illustrated that the interaction of method and gender had no influence on the achievement. Particularities of the context of the study causing the results and study's far-reaching implications were discussed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "There is a recognized need for research on how to teach computer programming in primary schools in Sweden grades 4–6 (10–12-year-old pupils). Studies of teaching show the importance of teachers' knowledge of content and pedagogy and how these two parts affect each other (i.e. pedagogical content knowledge [PCK]). Most teachers in Sweden have little or no formal education in computer programming, the revised Swedish curriculum requires them to teach it. The aim of this study is to explore the pedagogical strategies teachers use when they teach computer programming. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 14 participants, comprising 12 teachers and 2 teacher trainers. The data were analysed deductively with themes from previous research. The results show that teachers use eight pedagogical strategies, including three new strategies that have been constructed inductively: do-it-yourself, gamification and progression. These eight pedagogical strategies are mostly general, and teachers may be considered regressed experts, as they lack formal training in computer programming. They facilitate learning in a general sense, but, compared to other subjects, their PCK in computer programming is problematized. In-service teacher training is needed to increase content knowledge, thus enabling to develop PCK in computer programming. It would also be fruitful to deepen our knowledge regarding pedagogical strategies in the PCK domain of computer programming. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "This study's objectives are to translate the scale to Turkish, conduct a validity and reliability analysis of the \"Digital Learning Games Scale (DLGS)\" produced by Mukh et al. (2021), and assess the scale in terms of numerous variables. The survey model, a quantitative research technique, was employed in the study to achieve this goal. Primary school instructors employed in Malatya throughout the 2022-2023 academic year make up the study's universe. Following the scale's conversion to Turkish, the data were analyzed using SPSS 2.0 and AMOS statistical programs. The scale scores derived from the field data collection were evaluated using descriptive statistical approaches, such as mean and standard deviation. When comparing quantitative continuous data between two independent groups, the t-test was used, and when comparing quantitative continuous data between more than two independent groups, the One-way Anova test was employed. There is a significant difference according to seniority, digital game playing status, digital game use status in lessons, and the infrastructure of the school they work in. Teachers were found to have educational digital games in general, developing social skills, developing cognitive skills, learning by having fun, developing affective skills, encouraging creativity, and developing psychomotor skills. However, there was no discernible difference between digital game production and training when the gender variable was taken into account. (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "Researchers and practitioners are paying increasing attention to blockchain's potential for resolving trust, privacy, and transparency-related issues in smart education. Research on educational blockchain is also becoming an active field of research. Based on 206 studies published from 2017 to 2020, we identify contributors, collaborators, applications, and research topics using topic modeling and bibliometrics. Results indicate that currently, studies on the educational blockchain are mostly published in computer science conferences, with few in educational technology journals. Asian countries/regions (e.g., China and India) and institutions (e.g., University of Raharja) are active in this field. Countries/regions and institutions from the same regions tend to have close collaborations. Blockchain is mainly used to facilitate online testing and learning, education data mining and analytics, resource sharing, educational record verification and authentication, data management and storing, administration management, education/discipline of children, and college crowdfunding. Based on the results, we highlight the need to integrate artificial intelligence to enhance scalability and security and to facilitate justification and personalization of blockchain solutions based on accumulated big data to capture abnormal behaviors. This study assists researchers and practitioners in understanding educational blockchain research and becoming aware of the hot topics and future directions. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "Recently, Artificial Intelligence (AI), seen as an engineering domain, has been introduced into school education, but its pedagogy remains unclear. In general, group learning has been applied as a primary form of instruction in hands-on engineering activities. This learning approach is more common in higher education. School students are less mature; therefore, the benefits of adopting group learning as a pedagogical approach remain unclear. Group learning quality can be reflected by student–student interactions and dialogue within a group, and is classified into four types: collective, cooperating-in-parallel, dominant/defensive, and expert/novice. Accordingly, this experimental study involved 37 middle school students, and explored how they interacted within groups when learning AI through hands-on activities in the four group learning types. The Teacher Scheme for Educational Dialogue Analysis (T-SEDA) was used to code student–student interactions and compute their frequencies, and Lag Sequential Analysis was used to analyze the behavioral interaction sequence characteristics of the four group interaction patterns. The results showed that the expert/novice group learning had higher frequency of interaction, and also produced the longest, richest, and most complex sequences. The results suggest that this is the optimal approach to learning for younger students in hands-on AI activities as it encourages group members to interact with each other and reach a consensus. The results contribute to the literature by suggesting effective practices and confirming the use of T-SEDA in a new engineering school subject. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "Understanding the mechanism of emotion regulation and the formation of emotional engagement can improve online learning persistence and academic performance. This study was set to pinpoint the potential pathways between emotion regulation and emotional engagement through meta-emotion and develop a predictive model for online emotional engagement. The data collected from 302 college students were analysed using a two-stage structural equation modelling-artificial neural network approach. Firstly, the path analysis implied the significant linkages from emotion regulation to emotional engagement through emotional repair. Secondly, the artificial neural network analysis results suggested that emotional repair contributed to the development of emotional engagement most, and the current model predicted emotional engagement with an accuracy of 91.1%. The main contribution of the present study is providing empirical evidence to predict emotional engagement from novel perspectives through a two-stage approach. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "Collaborative learning by teaching (CLBT) is a pedagogical approach that combines collaborative learning and learning by teaching pedagogy, which can be applied to university classrooms with the support of information and communication technology (ICT). This pedagogy not only emphasizes the independent learning of group members, but also emphasizes the process of collaborative learning and cooperative teaching among group members. For current Chinese college students, even with the support of online learning resources and ICT, CLBT is a relatively difficult task for group members, which needs to be combined with some regulatory strategies. Socially shared learning regulation (SSRL) has attracted widespread attention from educators and researchers as an effective collaborative learning regulation strategy, but so far, there is few studies on the effects of SSRL in CLBT environment, especially on psychological variables. This study explored the effects of SSRL on the computational thinking, learning motivation, engagement, and academic achievement of university students in CLBT by conducting a semester-long quasi-experiment in a data mining course with 72 third-year undergraduates at a Chinese public university. The experimental class adopted SSRL in CLBT with 41 students (33 males, eight females), while the control class only implemented CLBT with 31 students (26 males, five females). The independent sample t-test results showed that the students in the experimental class significantly improved their intrinsic motivation, engagement (Deep processing strategy and affective engagement), and computational thinking (Algorithmic thinking, critical thinking and problem solving) than those in the control class. In addition, the student's academic achievements in the experimental class were significantly higher than the students in the control class. This study enriches the practical cases of educators and researchers and makes recommendations for future research, such as combining project-based learning approaches with CLBT or investigating the relationship among these psychological variables and academic performance.

        "The pandemic has brought teachers, young children and their parents lots of uncertainties and challenges in adapting to new teaching and learning environment. Compared with other professionals, teachers might face more challenges in transiting from using a traditional face-to-face teaching method to an online or blended teaching and learning model. This study aimed to explore Chinese primary school English language and literacy teachers' teaching preparation, in particular, their knowledge with regard to incorporating online technologies in learning and teaching. Participants in this project were English language and literacy teachers in central China. The study used a survey with a Likert scale to examine primary school English language and literacy teachers' perceptions of using digital technology in teaching preparation, students' competence development, assessment and professional development (PD) for online teaching. The results confirmed differing perspectives between young teachers and their elder colleagues on the value of using digital technology for online teaching and their PD programmes. A call for PD programmes is also proposed and discussed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "This article reports on a trace‐based assessment of approaches to learning used by middle school aged children who interacted with NASA Mars Mission science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) games in Whyville, an online game environment with 8 million registered young learners. The learning objectives of two games included awareness and knowledge of NASA missions, developing knowledge and skills of measurement and scaling, applying measurement for planetary comparisons in the solar system. Trace data from 1361 interactions were analysed with nonparametric multidimensional scaling methods, which permitted visual examination and statistical validation, and provided an example and proof of concept for the multidimensional scaling approach to analysis of time‐based behavioural data from a game or simulation. Differences in approach to learning were found illustrating the potential value of the methodology to curriculum and game‐based learning designers as well as other creators of online STEM content for pre‐college youth. The theoretical framework of the method and analysis makes use of the Epistemic Network Analysis toolkit as a post hoc data exploration platform, and the discussion centres on issues of semantic interpretation of interaction end‐states and the application of evidence centred design in post hoc analysis. Practitioner notesWhat is already known about this topic Educational game play has been demonstrated to positively affect learning performance and learning persistence.Trace‐based assessment from digital learning environments can focus on learning outcomes and processes drawn from user behaviour and contextual data.Existing approaches used in learning analytics do not (fully) meet criteria commonly used in psychometrics or for different forms of validity in assessment, even though some consider learning analytics a form of assessment in the broadest sense.Frameworks of knowledge representation in trace‐based research often include concepts from cognitive psychology, education and cognitive science.What this paper adds To assess skills‐in‐action, stronger connections of learning analytics with educational measurement can include parametric and nonparametric statistics integrated with theory‐driven modelling and semantic network analysis approaches widening the basis for inferences, validity, meaning and understanding from digital traces.An expanded methodological foundation is offered for analysis in which nonparametric multidimensional scaling, multimodal analysis, epistemic network analysis and evidence‐centred design are combined.Implications for practice and policy The new foundations are suggested as a principled, theory‐driven, embedded data collection and analysis framework that provides structure for reverse engineering of semantics as well as pre‐planning frameworks that support creative freedom in the processes of creation of digital learning environments.

        "This article presents a study of an educational experiment conducted at the early childhood education programme at UiT, the Arctic University of Norway. As COVID-19 made social distancing an issue, the traditional practicum in kindergartens was moved to online platforms. Constructive alignment was used as an analytical framework to investigate the possibilities and limitations of student teachers' learning outcomes in a collaborative online learning activity. Overall, 8 out of 9 practicum teachers found the online practicum form a better alternative than supplying the student teacher with a written assignment, and 72.7% of the student teachers agreed or somewhat agreed with facilitating learning outcomes from the online practicum regardless of social distancing. The need for professional digital competence is central, as digital technology is not simply part of pedagogical practices but is becoming an integrated part of communicating and collaborating with colleagues and parents. This study broadens the understanding of how collaborative online learning can facilitate unintended valuable learning outcomes and critically debates the limitations related to emphasising a too-strong focus on intended learning outcomes as a premise for constructive alignment in education.

        "This study proposed a cognitive-based game mechanism based on the revised Bloom's taxonomy of cognitive processing dimensions. Moreover, a mobile Chinese history educational game, Void Broken: The Qing Dynasty, was developed based on the cognitive-based game mechanism to promote learners' cognitive thinking in history learning. This empirical study conducted an experiment with a quasi-experiment design and the participants were 70 high school freshmen from northern Taiwan, who were selected by convenience sampling. The present study analyzed the participants' historical knowledge gains and flow state. This study proposed an operational behavior coding scheme to analyze learning behaviors and evaluate the proposed cognitive-based game mechanism design and conducted sequential analyses to explore their learning behavioral patterns and their collaborative problem solving (CPS) behaviors in the game-based learning (GBL) process. The results suggested that the mechanism helped learners' historical knowledge gains, flow, and CPS behaviors. The high flow groups showed more multifaceted and active problem-solving behavioral patterns than the low flow groups. We suggest educational game designers consider including the cognitive-based game mechanism and flow antecedents into their game designs. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "In the past decades, collaborative game-based learning has been used to facilitate students' learning in authentic learning contexts. Although several previous studies have reported the potential of this approach for students' learning performance and motivation, unequal participation could negatively influence the learning effectiveness of collaborative learning. To this end, this study developed a mandatory contribution-based collaborative gaming approach (MCCG) to enhance the competencies for conducting practical solutions related to environmental issues during a cross-field learning activity between a school and a museum. MCCG and a conventional collaborative gaming approach (CCG) were implemented to investigate the effects of individual contributions on collaborative learning. Both individual learning achievements and collaborative learning outcomes were assessed. The results showed that game-based collaboration supports can support competency-based education to enhance students' competencies, such as problem-solving and critical thinking competencies. Those students who learned with the mandatory contribution approach had better collaborative learning outcomes. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "In major public health crises, online education can play an important role in guaranteeing the continuity of education. However, whether online education can promote educational equity has been questioned widely. The COVID-19 pandemic has revealed severe challenges students face in online teaching. Based on Bourdieu's theory of cultural reproduction and 34 interviews with participants including students, parents, and teachers, this research adopted a case study approach to explore the digital divide among Chinese rural and urban secondary school students during the COVID-19 pandemic. It was found that despite measures adopted by the Chinese government, a wider digital divide has been created between urban and rural secondary schools, and the online learning result was heavily influenced by the socioeconomic status of both the individuals and the schools they attended. More specifically, compared with urban students, rural students had less access to sui digital devices and environment, quality-parental guide and supervision, effective teachers' instruction, and worse habitus and less ability in independent online learning. Overall, this study calls on policymakers, leaders, educators, and parents to take collective actions to create a more effective online educational environment for students from the vulnerable and disadvantaged groups.

        "This study investigated how the acceptance and use of self-regulatory strategies in online learning affected Hong Kong secondary school students' participation in online learning. A self-reported questionnaire was distributed to 1381 students from six secondary schools. Findings of the descriptive analysis indicated that students did not frequently use most types of online self-regulatory strategies. Although they agreed that the online learning methods were easy to use and facilitated learning, they did not actively participate in online learning activities and showed a low tendency to continuation. Further, structural equation modeling indicated that the effect of strategy use on actual participation was stronger than that of user acceptance. The former had a significant indirect effect on actual participation through the strong effect it had on user acceptance. Consequently, suggestions have been made for improving the instructional design of online learning and increasing students' willingness and readiness to participate in online learning.

        "Academic procrastination refers to individuals' unnecessary postponement of their coursework and is harmful for academic performance. When situated in self‐placed and remote learning environments, students' tendency to procrastinate increases. Therefore, understanding why students procrastinate and identifying who is more likely to delay unnecessarily in online learning environments is an important area to study. The goal of this study was to respond to this call by examining the structural relations between conscientiousness, prior online learning experience, achievement emotions and academic procrastination in online learning environments using structural equation modelling. In particular, two main facets of conscientiousness—proactive and inhibitive—were examined in order to understand which facet was more responsible for procrastination, how each facet was related to procrastination and to determine which facet of conscientiousness should be the primary target for intervention in future experimental research. A total of 746 students from 49 secondary and postsecondary schools participated in the current study. The results showed that the proactive aspect of conscientiousness was negatively related to academic procrastination through the pathway of enjoyment. The inhibitive aspect of conscientiousness was negatively related to academic procrastination through the pathways of negative emotions. Although prior online learning experience did not have a significant and direct association with academic procrastination, it was indirectly related to students' tendency to put off coursework through the pathways of enjoyment and negative emotions. Of all the paths, negative emotions had the strongest associations with academic procrastination in online learning environments. The findings of indirect effects suggest that students with low conscientiousness, the inhibitive aspect in particular, and few prior online learning experiences are more likely to procrastinate in online classes possibly owing to the suboptimal emotional experiences aroused during their learning processes. Practitioner notesWhat is already known about this topicConscientiousness has a direct association with academic procrastination in in‐person classes.Prior online learning experience has direct associations with students' adaptive regulatory processes in online classes.Achievement emotion is an integral part of online learning.What this paper addsConscientiousness has a direct association with academic procrastination in online learning environments.Prior online learning experience has no direct associations with academic procrastination in online learning environments.Conscientiousness indirectly relates to academic procrastination through achievement emotions in online learning environments.Prior online learning experience indirectly relates to academic procrastination through achievement emotions in online learning environments.Implications for practice and/or policyInstructors are suggested to pay attention to students with low conscientiousness and few prior online learning experiences since they are more likely to procrastinate in online learning environments.Students' tendency to procrastinate in online learning environments is strongly associated with their emotional experience.

        "Background: Academic dishonesty (AD) and trustworthy assessment (TA) are fundamental issues in the context of an online assessment. However, little systematic work currently exists on how researchers have explored AD and TA issues in online assessment practice. Objectives: Hence, this research aimed at investigating the latest findings regarding AD forms, factors affecting AD and TA, and solutions to reduce AD and increase TA to maintain the quality of online assessment. Methods: We reviewed 52 articles in Scopus and Web of Science databases from January 2017 to April 2021 using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐Analyses model as a guideline to perform a systematic literature review that included three stages, namely planning, conducting, and reporting. Results and conclusions: Our review found that there were different forms of AD among students in online learning namely plagiarism, cheating, collusion, and using jockeys. Individual factors such as being lazy to learn, lack of ability, and poor awareness as well as situational factors including the influence of friends, the pressure of the courses, and ease of access to information were strongly associated with AD. A technology‐based approach such as using plagiarism‐checking software, multi‐artificial intelligence (AI) in a learning management system, computer adaptive tests, and online proctoring as well as pedagogical‐based approaches, such as implementing a research ethics course programme, and a re‐design assessment form such as oral‐based and dynamic assessment to reduce cheating behaviour and also sociocultural and sociotechnical adjustment related to the online assessment are reported to reduce AD and increase TA. Implications: Educators should adjust the design of online learning and assessment methods as soon as possible. The identified gaps point towards unexplored study on AI, machine learning, learning analytics tools, and related issues of AD and TA in K12 education could motivated future work in the field. Lay Description: What is already known about this topic: Online assessment has become a global trend in the last 10 years, especially since PISA (2015) and TIMSS (2019) were adopted, then, the increasing adoption of MOOCs and online learning due to the COVID‐19 pandemic.Academic dishonesty (AD) and trustworthy assessment (TA) are hot issues in online assessment practices that are interesting to study.Research findings on the associated factors of AD and efforts to increase TA in online assessments are still inconclusive.Contemporary research on AD and TA in online assessment lacks of comprehensive systematic review. What this paper adds: This paper systematically reviewed 5 years of empirical research (2017–2021) on AD and TA in online assessment in both K‐12 and higher education.This paper revealed the most recent trends developing in the literature regarding the factors contributing to the appearance of AD in online assessment.This paper revealed a recent report on efforts to improve TA in online assessment.This paper recommended several new pedagogical and technological approaches to reduce AD and increase TA in online assessment. Implications for practice: Education managers, professional associations, teachers, and lecturers need to reeducate the academic community about the risks of AD in online assessments.Teachers need to redesign the form of online assessment to achieve HOTs and reduce multiple‐choice questions. On the other hand, oral‐based, project‐based assessments, and student work portfolios are encouraged to be adopted.Online assessment using an adaptive and intelligent online assessment approach, randomization of delivery question systems, smart proctoring, AI for online assessment, and learning analytic technology is recommended to be studied massively.Research on AD and TA at the K‐12 and higher education levels needs to be intensified considering online learning programs in the era of the COVID‐19 pandemic.

        "Today, more than any other period in time, digital fluency is regarded as a necessary life skill for both children and adults. The potential of digital tools in early childhood learning has been recognized as helping to reinforce academic skills, as a way to communicate ideas and develop social skills, to support children to learn at their own pace, to learn how to learn and to make learning fun. This article contributes to the current research by conducting a participatory study in a kindergarten in Finland over the course of one year. The empirical data are analysed to (1) identify the characteristics of educational activities that make use of digital technology in early childhood education and (2) reveal the pedagogical approaches behind these activities. The findings of this study show that pedagogical activities entailing playful interaction with technology and the production of tangible artefacts, accompanied by visual documentation and reflection, support the effective use of technology in early childhood education. The educators' open approach towards the use of technology also played a significant part in the positive outcomes experienced by teachers and students. We call this approach open design pedagogy and propose it as a model for using digital technologies in early childhood education. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "Considering that teleworking and online training are on the rise following the pandemic, studying how school-life balance affects the development of VET competences in online learning during COVID-19 can provide relevant information to enhance educational equity in the future. A longitudinal study was conducted employing an on-line questionnaire to meet the following aims: to explore the development of cross-disciplinary competences in VET during COVID-19; to identify different students' profiles according to their school-life balance during the pandemic; and, to analyse whether the school-life balance was affecting competency development and propose improvements to training as a result. Results show that cross-disciplinary competences did not undergo important changes between the pre-pandemic scenario and during it, except for a decrease in metacognitive self-regulation. Similarly, most students reported having spent the same time studying before and during the pandemic. However, three main profiles of students are revealed, highlighting certain school-life imbalances. While all agree that remote teaching was critical in coping with the situation, differences were found by age and gender, with some participants experiencing more challenging situations. These results provide a fertile context for VET designers and teachers to generate new learning scenarios that meet all students' potential needs. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "Artificial intelligence (AI) education for K-12 students is an emerging necessity, owing to the rapid advancement and deployment of AI technologies. It is essential to take teachers' perspectives into account when creating ecologically valid AI education programmes for K-12 settings. However, very few studies investigated teacher perception of AI education. Phenomenography is an empirical research method that was widely used to understand teacher's interpretive understanding of new phenomenon, in this study, the teaching of AI in secondary school. Therefore, the present study investigated teachers' conceptions of teaching AI using a phenomenographic approach. Twenty-eight in-service teachers from 17 secondary schools in Hong Kong were invited to participate in an interview after implementing an AI curriculum. Six categories of teacher conceptions were identified: (1) technology bridging, (2) knowledge delivery, (3) interest stimulation, (4) ethics establishment, (5) capability cultivation, and (6) intellectual development. The hierarchical relationships of the six concepts were organised as an outcome space. The space shows a range of surface to deep conceptions and offers an understanding of how teachers perceive AI education through their teaching experience. Two learning paths have been suggested for cultivating technical and non-technical teachers for teaching AI. These learning paths provide insights for teacher educators and policymakers to enhance teachers' competence in teaching AI and promote general AI education for K-12 students.

        "Background: It is vital to understand students' Self‐Regulatory Learning (SRL) processes, especially in Blended Learning (BL), when students need to be more autonomous in their learning process. In studying SRL, most researchers have followed a variable‐oriented approach. Moreover, little has been known about the unfolding process of students' SRL profiles. Objectives: We present the insights derived from a study that measured motivation and the learning strategies used by 198 students of a university entry‐level, business school, BL course to develop an understanding of students' SRL processes. Methods: The Strategies for Learning Questionnaire (MSLQ) was used to survey 198 students three times during a semester to investigate SRL profiles and how they unfolded as the course progressed using a person‐oriented approach. Through a clustering approach, we focus on MSLQ's motivation aspects as its importance has been emphasised by different SRL theories, and extant research into motivation in learning analytics (LA) is still lacking. Results and Conclusions: Through the longitudinal clustering approach, we identified minimally, average, and highly SRL profiles. We acknowledged that students might change their SRL profiles as the course progressed as a result of feedback they received. What are the 1 or 2 Major Takeaways from the Study?: This study contributes to the SRL theory by examining students' SRL profiles adaptation longitudinally (addressing the challenge identified regarding the cyclical nature of SRL). This study contributes to LA by investigating motivational constructs currently lacking in the field and bringing forward theory based empirical evidence to inform theory and practice. Lay Description: What is currently known about the subject matter: Self‐regulated learning (SRL) is important for academic achievement, especially during online learning; more research is needed to understand students' SRL and its cyclical nature.Learning analytics (LA) is an advocate for gathering and analysing data for supporting students' learning. It lacks empirical evidence based on theoretical and students' motivational studies.Institutions will benefit from more research on evidence‐based practice in Blended Learning (BL). What this paper adds to that: Evidence for the understanding of students' SRL, identifying student subgroups (different SRL profiles), and observing the cyclical nature of SRL during BL courses.We enhanced LA through the use of empirical research into motivation and its mapping of students' SRL profiles.Contribute to knowledge within BL about the dynamics of students' motivation, strategy use, and SRL, and showing that successful students better self‐regulate their learning.Evidence to support the emerging role of LA in identifying at‐risk students during BL.Evidence shows the most important motivational and learning strategy constructs that are significantly correlated with the final score in BL. The implications of study findings for practitioners: Through LA, students, educators, and institutions can benefit when universities implement BL.Enabling educators to better understand their students' SRL and how students can adapt quite different SRL profiles over time. Through this information, they can help students adopt a better profile. They also can help students in their SRL process, for example, by applying appropriate interventions.Pedagogically helps lecturers when developing the instructional and interventional design.

        "Design education has traditionally been deemed a face-to-face endeavor causing online learning to be disregarded as a viable teaching option. Nonetheless, the recent impact of COVID-19 pressured design schools to rapidly migrate online, impelling many educators to utilize this unfamiliar and largely dismissed methodology. The impending problems exposed with this sudden shift point to a significant gap in research. Accordingly, this study proposes a set of guidelines targeting design knowledge-building, based on an in-depth look at student experience during an online design course. Data were collected through a 63-item course efficiency survey (n = 59) and a series of semi-structured focus group interviews (n = 16) with the enrolled students. The following overarching themes emerged through iterative thematic analysis of the interview data: (1) flexibility and handling stress, (2) managing self-pacing issues (3) formal conversation platform, (4) content variety and access options. The themes were interpreted in relation to the survey findings and the broader research on learning. The proposed guidelines emphasize initially clear goals and objectives, pacing flexibility with progress guidance, content and communication variety, sense of presence and peer exposure, and individualized feedback. It is expected that the guidelines will be helpful in building, conducting, and evaluating future online design knowledge-building experiences. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "Background: Formative assessments are needed to enable monitoring how student knowledge develops throughout a unit. Constructed response items which require learners to formulate their own free‐text responses are well suited for testing their active knowledge. However, assessing such constructed responses in an automated fashion is a complex task and requires the application of natural language processing methodology. In this article, we implement and evaluate multiple machine learning models for coding energy knowledge in free‐text responses of German K‐12 students to items in formative science assessments which were conducted during synchronous online learning sessions. Dataset: The dataset we collected for this purpose consists of German constructed responses from 38 different items dealing with aspects of energy such as manifestation and transformation. The units and items were implemented with the help of project‐based pedagogy and evidence‐centered design, and the responses were coded for seven core ideas concerning the manifestation and transformation of energy. The data was collected from students in seventh, eighth and ninth grade. Methodology: We train various transformer‐ and feature‐based models and compare their ability to recognize the respective ideas in students' writing. Moreover, as domain knowledge and its development can be formally modeled through knowledge networks, we evaluate how well the detection of the ideas within responses translated into accurate co‐occurrence‐based knowledge networks. Finally, in terms of the descriptive accuracy of our models, we inspect what features played a role for which prediction outcome and if the models pick up on undesired shortcuts. In addition to this, we analyze how much the models match human coders in what evidence within responses they consider important for their coding decisions. Results: A model based on a modified GBERT‐large can achieve the overall most promising results, although descriptive accuracy varies much more than predictive accuracy for the different ideas assessed. For reasons of comparability, we also evaluate the same machine learning architecture using the SciEntsBank 3‐Way benchmark with an English RoBERTa‐large model, where it achieves state‐of‐the‐art results in two out of three evaluation categories. Lay Description: What is already known about this topic?: Formative assessments are needed to test and monitor the development of learners' knowledge throughout a unit to provide them with appropriate automated feedback.Constructed response items which require learners to formulate their own free‐text responses are well suited for testing their active knowledge.Assessing constructed responses in an automated fashion is a widely researched topic, but the problem is far from solved and most of the work focuses on predicting holistic scores or grades.To allow for a more fine‐grained and analytic assessment of learners' knowledge, systems which go beyond predicting simple grades are required.To guarantee that models are stable and make their predictions for the correct reasons, methods for explaining the models are required. What this papers adds?: A core topic in physics education is the concept of energy.We implement and evaluate multiple systems based on natural language processing technology for assessing learners' conceptual knowledge about energy physics using transformer language models as well as feature‐based approaches.The systems assess students' knowledge about various forms of energy, indicators for the same and the transformation of energy from form into another.As our systems are based on machine learning methodology, we introduce a novel German short answer dataset for training them to detect the respective knowledge elements within students' free‐text responses.We evaluate the performance of these systems using this dataset as well as the well‐established SciEntsBand‐3‐Way dataset and manage to achieve, to our best knowledge, new state‐of‐the‐art results for the latter.Moreover, we apply methodology for explaining model predictions to assess whether predictions are carried out for the correct reasons. Implications for practice and/or policy: It is indeed possible to assess constructed responses for the demonstrated knowledge about energy physics in an analytic fashion using natural language processing.Transformer language models can outperform more specialized feature‐based approaches for this task in terms of predictive and descriptive accuracy.Co‐occurrences of different concepts within the same responses can lead models to learn undesired shortcuts which make them unstable.

        "Well‐designed computer or app‐based instruction has a number of potential benefits (eg increasing accessibility and feasibility of high‐quality instruction, reducing time and resources required for training expert delivery, saving instructional time). However, variation in implementation can still affect outcomes when using educational technology. Research generally suggests that without follow‐up support after training, implementation of educational interventions is often poor and outcomes reduced. However, the extent to which this is the case when the core element of an intervention is computer or app‐delivered is not yet clear. This study investigated the effects of providing ongoing implementation support for Headsprout Early Reading (HER, an early reading programme accessible via a computer or an app), to determine whether such support leads to better outcomes. Twenty‐two primary schools (269 learners) participated in a cluster‐randomised controlled trial. Eleven schools received initial training followed by ongoing support across the school year, whereas the other 11 schools received initial training and technical support only. Pre‐ and post‐measures of reading skills were conducted using the York Assessment of Reading for Comprehension. We found no effect of implementation support on outcomes, and no effect of implementation support on delivery of the core element of HER. However, there were some effects of implementation support on the implementation of other HER elements relating to the responsiveness of educators to learners' learning within HER. These findings have implications for providing access to high quality online instruction in early reading skills at scale, with minimal training. More broadly, the current study suggests that well‐designed computer or app‐based instruction can yield positive outcomes with minimal implementation support and training. However, further research is required to ensure the interplay between learners' app‐based learning and teacher intervention functions as intended to provide additional support for those who need it. Practitioner notesWhat is already known about this topicWell‐designed computer or app‐based instruction has a number of potential benefits (eg increasing accessibility and feasibility of high‐quality instruction, reducing time and resources required for training expert delivery, saving instructional time).Implementation can still affect outcomes when using educational technology, and without follow‐up support after training, implementation of educational interventions is often poor and outcomes reduced.The extent to which this is the case when the core element of an intervention is computer or app‐delivered is not yet clear.What this paper addsWe found that providing implementation support for teachers and teaching assistants delivering Headsprout Early Reading (HER; an early reading programme accessible via a computer or an app) did not affect the reading outcomes of learners.We also found the implementation support did not affect delivery of the core, app‐delivered element of the programme.However, there were notable differences in implementation of other aspects of the programme, particularly in relation to the role of the teacher or educational practitioner in managing the interplay between the app‐based learning and teacher intervention for learners who require further support.Implications for practice and policyThese findings have implications for providing access to high quality instruction in early reading skills at scale, with minimal training.More broadly, the current study suggests that well‐designed computer or app‐based instruction can yield positive outcomes with minimal implementation support and training.However, the findings of this study identify some potential risk of an over‐reliance on technology to facilitate the learning of all learners accessing the programme.Further research is required to ensure the interplay between learners' app‐based learning and teacher intervention functions as intended to provide additional support for those who need it.

        "In higher education, many universities in Taiwan let college students learn excel in a self-directed way. The current axle of the Excel curriculum mainly relies on self-directed learning. In the study, we designed the digital game \"Legendary Wizard Excel\" and took a certified Excel textbook as the research tool. The game we designed integrated the role-play with cognitive scaffolding to help learners learn Excel skills, whereas the textbook we used was \"Excel Expert\" in the Microsoft Office Specialist. We compared the Learning Effectiveness, Flow Status, and Technology Acceptance Model with 187 college students between two tools, and found that: (1) The game reached a high Technology Acceptance Model; (2) Both groups of learners had significant improvements in learning effectiveness and were engaged in the activity; (3) On learning effectiveness, learners in game-based learning groups achieved higher than learners in textbook groups; (4) Learners in game-based learning groups engaged better in the activity than learners in textbook groups. Therefore, in the future, we looked forward to bringing our results to higher education levels and workplace training to enhance the Excel skills. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "Background: Prior work has shown that middle school students struggle with algebra and that game‐based educational technologies, such as DragonBox and From Here to There!, are effective at improving students' algebraic performance. However, it remains unclear which aspects of algebraic knowledge shift as a result of playing these games and what game design features support algebraic learning. Objective: Using the data from a randomized controlled trial conducted in the 2020–2021 academic year, we (a) examined students' relative performance on assessment items measuring conceptual knowledge, procedural knowledge and procedural flexibility in algebraic equation solving, and (b) identified changes in these aspects of algebraic knowledge after playing DragonBox or From Here to There!. Methods: Eight hundred eighty‐seven seventh‐graders were randomly assigned to playing DragonBox or From Here to There! for nine 30‐min sessions throughout the school year. Students also completed a pretest, midtest and posttest measuring their algebraic knowledge. Results and Conclusion: First, prior to the intervention, students scored the highest on procedural knowledge and lowest on conceptual knowledge. Second, students significantly improved and maintained learning gains on conceptual knowledge throughout the intervention. Their performance on procedural knowledge and procedural flexibility items increased at midtest but decreased at posttest. Third, the pattern of results was consistent for students in the DragonBox and From Here to There! conditions, suggesting that both games may support students' conceptual understanding of algebra. The findings have implications for research and practice on supporting algebraic learning through game‐based technologies during and beyond educational disruptions. Lay Description: What is already known about this topic: Middle school students struggle with aspects of algebra.DragonBox and From Here to There! are two game‐based technologies designed to support students' algebraic learning.Both games implement point rewards and dynamic interactions; they differ in the uses of algebraic notation and problem structures. What this paper adds: Both games improved seventh‐graders' conceptual knowledge of algebraic equivalence.Students also improved on procedural knowledge and procedural flexibility, but the gains did not last to the end of the intervention. Implications for practice and/or policy: The games and their shared features may provide an engaging way to support students' conceptual understanding of algebra. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "The current research sought to test the effect of using technology on students in various mathematics courses. The study was conducted in the mathematics department of our college of education. We tested how the students evaluate our teaching method and how involved they are in the acquisition of knowledge while using different digital applications with respect to the basic features of the traditional compared to the constructivist classroom. We compared the students' attitudes towards the role of digital technology integration in learning/teaching mathematics in different courses taught with and without technological tools. The results indicate that the students' attitude towards teaching mathematics with the use of technology correspond with the constructivist approach to teaching, while their assessment of the classes without the use of technology matches characteristics of traditional classroom. The obtained result aligns well with the notion that integration of technology in mathematics teaching makes it possible to achieve a qualitatively higher level of teaching this subject at school.

        "With the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI), the demand for K-12 computer science (CS) education continues to grow. However, there has long been a lack of trained CS teachers. To promote the AI teaching competency of CS teachers, a professional development (PD) program based on the technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK) framework was intentionally designed in this research. A quasi-experimental design with a 25-day (75-h) intervention was conducted among 40 in-service CS teachers to examine its impact on AI teaching competency, including AI knowledge, AI teaching skills, and AI teaching self-efficacy. The quantitative data were collected via a pretest and posttest, and qualitative data were collected via artifact analysis and semistructured interviews. The results indicated that the TPACK-based PD program a) significantly improved CS teachers' AI knowledge, especially in representation and reasoning, interaction, and social impact; b) developed CS teachers' AI teaching skills, including their AI lesson plan ability and AI programming skills; and c) significantly improved CS teachers' AI teaching self-efficacy, both in AI teaching efficacy beliefs and AI teaching outcome expectancy. These findings revealed the effectiveness of the TPACK-based PD program in improving the AI teaching competency of K-12 CS teachers and could help to expand the design of effective PD for CS teachers.

        "The global pandemic has revealed a number of inequalities in education for students in Michigan, USA. Teachers were tasked with a sudden shift to online instruction as school closures across the state (and globe) forced education to operate in virtual classrooms. Given the continued need for online learning, it is necessary to examine the perspectives and experiences of teachers who worked throughout the school closures of spring 2020 and to identify ways to better support both teachers and students as they navigate virtual learning. The purpose of this exploratory qualitative study was to investigate K-12 teachers' experiences shifting their classrooms online and their overall perspectives on the use of digital literacies as a central part of student learning. Reported in this paper are the survey results from 389 teachers' perceptions of their effectiveness during the Covid-19 pandemic during the semester spring of 2020. Additionally, a randomly selected a subset of 12 elementary and 13 secondary teachers' semi-structured interviews were analyzed. Unsurprisingly, teachers reported many challenges meeting their students' needs as they transitioned to online learning. Findings revealed students who lacked access to reliable Internet and digital devices. Even when access was not an issue, students lacked the necessary digital literacy skills to navigate their online education. Teachers reported many challenges associated with online learning, particularly those related to student engagement, communication, and shifting pedagogies online. Therefore, there is a need for schools and curricula to include operational digital literacy skills earlier in formal education settings, and to prioritize these skills even when face-to-face instruction resumes.

        "To achieve adaptive learning, a dynamic assessment system equipped with a cognitive diagnosis was developed for this study, which adopts a three-stage model of diagnosis-intervention-assessment. To examine how this system influenced spatial geometry learning, the study used a quasi-experimental method to investigate student learning outcomes between different groups. One hundred sixteen junior high school students participating in the experiment were divided into experimental and control groups. Experimental group engaged in adaptive learning as they corrected their misconceptions in the learning intervention stage by using learning content provided according to their cognitive diagnosis results. Control group engaged in nonadaptive learning; they corrected misconceptions using self-selected learning content and thus engaged in learning activities that were not focused on their misconceptions. The results revealed that the adaptive learning students exhibited learning performance and misconception correction ratios superior to those in the control group. Through analysis, we discovered that nearly half of the nonadaptive learning students failed to select appropriate learning content for correcting their misconceptions. In addition, the time spent on learning by the students in the two groups was significantly different; the adaptive learning students spent significantly less time on learning than the nonadaptive students, thus exhibiting higher learning efficiency.

        "Adaptive learning systems personalize instruction to students' individual learning needs and abilities. Such systems have shown positive impacts on learning. Many schools in the United States have adopted adaptive learning systems, and the rate of adoption in China is accelerating, reaching almost 2 million unique users for one product alone in the past 3 years. Given such rapid adoption in China, it is useful to examine the efficacy of adaptive learning within that country's educational system. This study aimed to compare the learning impacts of individualized adaptive learning courseware to two common instructional approaches in China: large-group and small-group classroom instruction. This paper describes the results of two efficacy studies of one of China's first adaptive learning systems, Squirrel AI Learning. One study compares classroom-based individualized adaptive learning instruction to large-group instruction, and another to small-group instruction. Chinese eighth-grade students from two provinces randomly assigned to use Squirrel AI Learning showed greater gains on a mathematics test than those randomly assigned to whole-class or small-group instruction led by expert teachers. Findings provide a basis for further research into the selection, use, and impact of adaptive learning systems in Chinese education. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "Gamification is the use of game design elements, such as rules of play, point scoring and competition, in a non-game context, in learning activities. We designed a game, based on the famous augmented reality game Pokémon GO, called Insects GO in which players should capture images of real insects with their mobile phones. The hypothesis was that if students had to struggle in the search for information about the world of insects to fulfill tasks of a game, they could develop skills that would potentialise scientific knowledge on insect morphology and nomenclature and make them more attentive to the issues on the subject. The study has been conducted in a middle school with students aged 11 to 15 enrolled in the 6th to 9th years of middle school, totaling 21 students. This research is a case study and has been evaluated through a learning test called the History Word Association Test (HWAT) that quantitatively ascertains students' perceptions about their conceptions, in this case, regarding entomology. The interest and motivation of students in performing the activity were evaluated using ARCS model of motivational design. Students who participated in the proposed activity showed be motivated to play the game and the, learning test suggests an improvement in matters related to morphology, taxonomy and the insect life cycle. The Insect Go game seems to improve the learning of entomology in middle school. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "As digital technology is becoming an increasingly critical component of education, learners' socioeconomic status (SES) and technology use are becoming more important in their learning. In the context of English learning, the present study modeled how learners' SES and their perception of technology use for language learning are linked to their motivation for learning English as a foreign language (EFL) and level of English achievement. To this end, 306 South Korean college students' learner factors, motivation, and English achievement were measured. The results of the structural equation modeling analysis indicated that learners' SES was positively associated with their perception of technology use and motivation and indirectly associated with their language learning achievement. Furthermore, we found that learners' perception of technology use in language learning is associated with their motivation and achievement. In addition, among the several learner factors measured in this study, learners' expectancy of being successful in language learning as part of achievement motivation emerged as the strongest predictor of their language learning achievement. An in-depth discussion of pedagogical and policy implications is also provided. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "With a sample of 4,646 undergraduate students from four universities in China, this study examined the psychometric qualities of a newly-adapted measurement, namely, the Online Motivation and Engagement Scale for university and college students, and investigated the characteristics of and differences in Chinese students' motivation and engagement in emergent online learning during the COVID-19 pandemic. The results supported the reliability and construct validity of the measurement, and identified four types of learners with distinctive features of student engagement. The research revealed a complex picture with promising and worrying messages about student engagement in emergency online learning during the pandemic. These findings contribute to the conceptualisation and measurement of student engagement in online learning, and provide insights for improving online learning and teaching during and beyond the pandemic.

        "It's critical to foster artificial intelligence (AI) literacy for high school students, the first generation to grow up surrounded by AI, to understand working mechanism of data-driven AI technologies and critically evaluate automated decisions from predictive models. While efforts have been made to engage youth in understanding AI through developing machine learning models, few provided in-depth insights into the nuanced learning processes. In this study, we examined high school students' data modeling practices and processes. Twenty-eight students developed machine learning models with text data for classifying negative and positive reviews of ice cream stores. We identified nine data modeling practices that describe students' processes of model exploration, development, and testing and two themes about evaluating automated decisions from data technologies. The results provide implications for designing accessible data modeling experiences for students to understand data justice as well as the role and responsibility of data modelers in creating AI technologies.

        "Digital disruption is not a new phenomenon in education; however, it has become more prominent during the COVID-19 pandemic due to school closures and the related emergency remote teaching (ERT) period. Our study aims to explore the different pedagogical strategies that primary school teachers adopted during this period and determine how successful these strategies were in involving and engaging students. Altogether, 4028 teachers from 343 primary schools answered our online survey from all the regions of Hungary. The sample adequately represents the Hungarian primary school teacher population in terms of gender and age. We used cluster analysis and identified four clusters of pedagogical strategies; then, we used analysis of variance to explore how teachers' digital competence and their ability to involve students in online learning varied across different clusters. Our analysis grasps the complexity of the issue, as it shows that two rather distinct strategies were both successful in involving students, and thus, there is no single solution best suited to digital learning. Overall, digitally competent teachers loosened the originally strict structure of education and provided more feedback, which proved to be an important element in successfully involving students in digital learning during ERT. The framework validated in our research can be used by policymakers and school administrators in different national and educational contexts, enabling them to understand the complexity of online teaching and learning. Furthermore, our results can offer some practical pointers for school teachers on how to combine different pedagogical strategies. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "Elementary, middle, and high school students need opportunities to engage with educational technology. This is particularly essential for those students who may not have access to new technologies at home and/or school. The socioeconomic status continues to increase the digital divide and equity in education in terms of access to technology; and as new and advanced technology becomes more available for some, others are falling further behind. A key component in ensuring all K-12 students receive opportunities to engage with technology is to prepare preservice teachers to be proficient at using new educational technologies in their classrooms. Virtual Reality (VR) environments are gaining traction across some environments. However, in the United States, some states limit or exclude VR from elementary and middle grades. In a recent service-learning project, 14 preservice teachers were introduced to two types of floor-robots and one style of a VR headset. Most preservice teachers had not used any of the technology prior to the required course. After learning how to manipulate floor-robots and navigate virtual environments, they taught middle and high school students with exceptionalities how to use technology to enhance comprehension of mathematics and social studies content. Of the 14 preservice teachers in the course, seven agreed to allow their surveys and reflections to be used for data collection and analysis. Results demonstrate that preservice teachers view technology for use in school settings favorably, and they believed that middle and high school students with exceptionalities benefitted from the educational technology instructional experiences. However, there were some concerns about costs. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "As artificial intelligence (AI) technologies are increasingly pervasive in our daily lives, the need for students to understand the working mechanisms of AI technologies has become more urgent. Data modeling is an activity that has been proposed to engage students in reasoning about the working mechanism of AI technologies. While Computational thinking (CT) has been conceptualized as critical processes that students engage in during data modeling, much remains unexplored regarding how students created features from unstructured data to develop machine learning models. In this study, we examined high school students' patterns of iterative model development and themes of CT processes in iterative model development. Twenty-eight students from a journalism class engaged in refining machine learning models iteratively for classifying negative and positive reviews of ice cream stores. This study draws on a theoretical framework of CT processes to examine students' model development processes. The results showed that students (1) demonstrated three patterns of iterative model development, including incremental, filter-based, and radical feature creation; (2) engaged in complex reasoning about language use in diverse contexts in trial and error, (3) leveraged multiple data representations when applying mathematical and computational techniques. The results provide implications for designing accessible AI learning experiences for students to understand the role and responsibility of modelers in creating AI technologies and studying AI learning experiences from the angle of CT processes.

        "The current study is an approximate replication of Gray and DiLoreto's (2016) study, which proposed a model predicting that course structure, learner interaction and instructor presence would influence students' perceived learning and satisfaction in online learning, with student engagement acting as a mediator between two of the predictors and the outcome variables. Using mixed methods, the current study investigated whether Gray and DiLoreto's model would be able to explain the relationships among the same variables in a computer-assisted language learning environment. A mediation analysis was conducted using survey responses from a sample of 215 college-level students, and qualitative analysis was conducted on the survey responses from a subsample of 50 students. Similar to Gray and DiLoreto's study, positive correlational relationships emerged between the variables. However, the model proposed by Gray and DiLoreto did not fit our data well, leading us to suggest alternative path-analytic models with both student engagement and learner interaction as mediators. These models showed that the role of course organization and instructor presence were pivotal in explaining the variation in students' perceived learning and satisfaction both directly and indirectly via student engagement and learner interaction. Moreover, qualitative analysis of students' responses to open-ended questions suggested that from students' perspectives, course structure was the most salient factor affecting their experiences within online language learning contexts, followed by learner interaction, and then by instructor presence.

Objectives: This study investigated the effect of group size in a K‐12 introductory Artificial Intelligence course by comparing the students' cognitive load, learning motivation, collaborative problem‐solving quality, and in‐classroom interaction between two‐ and three‐student groups. Methods: Forty‐eight high school students were randomly assigned to two kinds of groups (i.e., the two‐student group, and the three‐student group, each consisting of 24 students). During the experiment, Xiaofei robots were used to teach the theoretical and practical content of five AI topics over 6 weeks for 1.5 h each week. Results: The ANOVA results indicated that group size mattered in the AI course, the two‐student group was more effective in terms of enhancing students' learning motivation and collaborative problem‐solving quality, as well as imposing more cognitive load than the three‐student group. The advantage was more obvious in the practical problem context. The Lag Sequential Analysis results indicated that more collaborative learning behavioural sequences existed in the two‐student group than in the three‐student groups. Contribution: This research provides empirical evidence and potential guidance for group design in Artificial Intelligence Education. Although group size did not affect students' learning achievement, it affected learning motivation, cognitive load, and problem‐solving quality and processes. Two‐student groups work better than three‐student groups in the AI course. Lay Description: Group size affected students' learning motivation, cognitive load, and problem solving process, but not their learning achievement.The two‐student group was more effective in terms of enhancing students' learning motivation and collaborative problem‐solving quality, while imposing more cognitive load than the three‐student groups.The Lag Sequential Analysis results indicated that more collaborative learning behavioural sequences existed in the two‐student group than in the three‐student groups. The tendency was more obvious in the practical problem context than in the theoretical problem context.Overall, in terms of problem‐solving and learning, group size should be considered in instructional design of AI courses.

        "Following lockdowns in 2020 owing to Covid‐19, schools needed to find a way to ensure the education of their pupils. In order to do this, they engaged in digital learning, to varying extents. Innovations emanated from all school staff including, for example, teachers, leaders and teaching assistants. Some were already innovating in this area and brought forward and implemented digital strategies, while others engaged with digital learning for the first time. While research is emerging about the effects of the pandemic restrictions on pupils and staff in relation to key issues such as mental health and educational attainment, very little is known about the impact on school leaders' strategic planning processes. To address this gap, this paper draws on a UK Research and Innovation funded study adopting a strategy as learning approach to report on 50 qualitative interviews with school leaders to examine digital strategy in English secondary schools, before, during and after July 2021, when restrictions were lifted in England. It draws on strategy as learning literature to evaluate if schools have changed their strategic planning for digital learning, as a direct response to having learned and innovated during the pandemic. The paper concludes that there is evidence that digital innovations during the pandemic have changed the ways in which leaders think about their digital strategy, thus supporting a strategy as learning approach. However it also concludes that although there is ample evidence that the pandemic has changed the way many schools view digital learning, for some schools, there remain persistent barriers to digital integration and planning. These emanate both from material and cultural considerations, as well as leader vision and belief in digital learning. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "Using commercial videogames as learning objects for the development of 21st century skills in secondary schools has been a relevant topic of study in recent years. But its use in the field of physical education is especially interesting considering its nature. The aim of this article is to explore how elements like technological competence, game-based learning, accessibility, and enjoyment are relevant factors that influence the acceptance of the use of video games as a learning aid in the context of physical education, as well as their influence on academic performance in the subject itself. The study enlisted the participation of 166 secondary school students. A quasi-experimental pre-post design with a non-equivalent control group was used. The intervention consisted of a specific training program entailing nine one-hour sessions once a week. To develop the model, the data was analysed using the optimisation technique of partial least squares (PLS). Our findings show that the factors studied, which are accessibility, enjoyment, technological competence and learning through video games, have an impact on students' acceptance of video games as an educational tool and how this positive relationship leads to enhanced academic performance in physical education.

        "The coronavirus pandemic has caused a shift in how many teaching, learning and research activities are conducted internationally. Lockdowns compelled all education sectors, including higher education (HE), to adopt a variety of online learning practices at short notice. As these changes in practice have implications beyond the pandemic, more needs to be understood about settings across the globe where the move to online may pose particular challenges. This study brings a focus to how lecturers in a college of education in Nigeria responded to the professional demands of lockdowns and developed strategies for managing educational activities that have relevance during and beyond the pandemic itself. The aim of the study reported in this paper was to examine lecturers' perceptions of the management of teaching, learning and research activities during a lockdown, drawing out longer term implications. Data were collected through in-depth, one-to-one interviews with six lecturers from a college of education in Nigeria. Interview data were analysed qualitatively. Detailed analysis indicated that lecturers' strategies included encouraging students to engage in self-directed learning, as they uploaded learning materials on messaging groups and the college's e-learning platform. However, lecturers felt that the quality of teaching and assessment was compromised by factors including: irregular power supply, poor internet connection, high data costs and some students' limited digital skills. A particular concern was students' lack of interaction on the online platforms, which lecturers perceived to result in a more passive teaching and learning process. Lecturers also experienced difficulties undertaking research activities. A range of strategies and implications for the ongoing management of educational activities was discussed. The study offers insights into how some of the challenges encountered could be addressed to support sustainable online and blended teaching and learning in the longer term, in settings internationally where there are barriers to accessing online teaching and learning. Crucial aspects include strengthening educational technology training for lecturers and students, enhancing e-learning platforms for teaching practical courses, and enabling lecturers to develop beneficial and valuable online resources.

        "Teaching and learning Computational Thinking (CT) is at the forefront of educational interest. In the process of teaching and learning CT, learning strategies and tools play an important role. Efforts have been made to apply several learning strategies for teaching Computational Thinking. Among them, game-based learning and scaffolding are widely adopted. However, more research is needed on how the absence and presence of scaffolding strategies in programming games could affect students' cognitive CT learning gains. This study aims to investigate the effect of scaffolding programming games on the development of middle school students' CT. In addition, herein we aim to explore the effect of students' programming attitudes in their CT development. To this end, students were introduced to CT under two distinct experimental conditions: a scaffolding version of a programming game and a non-scaffolding version of the same game. Results report statistically significant differences between the pre- and post-intervention CT scores for all students and statistically significant improvement in learning outcomes in favor of the scaffolding group. In addition, the study hypothesized that attitudes towards programming would have an impact on students' CT. Although this hypothesis has not been confirmed, the results suggest that students who have a less positive attitude towards programming could particularly benefit from scaffolding aspects in programming games.

        "Research on vocabulary acquisition in digital game-based learning has been increasing over the years, with advancements in technology giving rise to numerous learning alternatives in second language acquisition. As virtual reality gaming offers new opportunities to explore its effectiveness in language learning, it is thus important to investigate the benefits of virtual reality gaming on English vocabulary learning, as well as the potential in incorporating virtual reality to teaching practices in the classroom. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the effects of virtual reality (VR) and personal computer (PC) gaming on language learners' vocabulary learning, as well as their affective perception. Thirty Grade 12 high school students participated in this study and were randomly assigned to either the VR or PC group. The VR group played a Sci-fi VR visual novel game, Angels and Demigods, using the Oculus Go whereas the PC group played the same game in the PC version without the VR elements. The gaming session lasted for fifty minutes for both groups. A vocabulary translation and recognition pretest, posttest and delayed posttest were adopted to compare their performance, along with a questionnaire to probe into their perception towards their respective treatment. The results revealed that both the VR group and the PC group were able to gain vocabulary knowledge in both the translation and recognition tests. In comparison, the VR group demonstrated a significantly higher mean score than the PC group in the vocabulary translation delayed posttest. The questionnaire showed that learners in both groups enjoyed playing the visual novel game and were willing to adopt it as a tool for learning vocabulary. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "The qualitative research employed semi-structured interviews with 28 elementary school teachers to examine the types of knowledge they use to integrate digital game-based learning (DGBL) into their classrooms and the nature of their integration planning. The findings revealed that teachers use four types of knowledge: game knowledge, game technological knowledge, game pedagogical knowledge and game technological pedagogical content knowledge. Five integration planning stages were identified, with stages A–C concerning the process of game selection and stages D–E concerning the integration of games in the classroom. Most teachers plan DGBL integration into their classrooms using a structured approach that follows each stage in order, whereas some teachers adopt a flexible planning pattern that omits or reorders some stages. The types of knowledge teachers use at each DGBL integration planning stage were identified and will be relevant to teacher educators and to teachers seeking to better integrate DGBL into their practice.

        "This study (1) used a person-centered approach to identify specific subgroups of 1,265 EFL learners who participated in Informal Digital Learning of English (IDLE) activities, and (2) looked at how different IDLE profiles are related to important affective variables. : To identify IDLE profiles, we used cluster analysis. The L2 motivation, L2 enjoyment, L2 anxiety, and grit levels of the IDLErs with distinct profiles differed significantly. When compared to Profiles 1 (Minimal IDLErs: 33%), 2 (Gaming-Entertainment IDLErs: 16%), and 3 (Entertainment IDLErs: 30%), both Profile 4 (Maximal IDLErs: 11%) and Profile 5 (Entertainment-socializing IDLErs: 10%) demonstrated significantly higher scores on Ideal L2 self, L2 enjoyment-self, L2 enjoyment-others, L2 communication anxiety-offline, and Grit. Profiles 4 and 5 made full use of out-of-school digital environment, which provided several affective benefits for EFL learners. Methodologically, the analytical and statistical approach could help to move informal language learning research one step closer to being more person-centered. In practice, the various IDLE profiles identified in this study may be of interest to EFL teachers in order to better understand their students' IDLE activities outside of school and to inform classroom teaching and learning.

        "Digital technologies have brought changes to the nature and scope of education and led education systems worldwide to adopt strategies and policies for ICT integration. The latter brought about issues regarding the quality of teaching and learning with ICTs, especially concerning the understanding, adaptation, and design of the education systems in accordance with current technological trends. These issues were emphasized during the recent COVID-19 pandemic that accelerated the use of digital technologies in education, generating questions regarding digitalization in schools. Specifically, many schools demonstrated a lack of experience and low digital capacity, which resulted in widening gaps, inequalities, and learning losses. Such results have engendered the need for schools to learn and build upon the experience to enhance their digital capacity and preparedness, increase their digitalization levels, and achieve a successful digital transformation. Given that the integration of digital technologies is a complex and continuous process that impacts different actors within the school ecosystem, there is a need to show how these impacts are interconnected and identify the factors that can encourage an effective and efficient change in the school environments. For this purpose, we conducted a non-systematic literature review. The results of the literature review were organized thematically based on the evidence presented about the impact of digital technology on education and the factors that affect the schools' digital capacity and digital transformation. The findings suggest that ICT integration in schools impacts more than just students' performance; it affects several other school-related aspects and stakeholders, too. Furthermore, various factors affect the impact of digital technologies on education. These factors are interconnected and play a vital role in the digital transformation process. The study results shed light on how ICTs can positively contribute to the digital transformation of schools and which factors should be considered for schools to achieve effective and efficient change.

        "In the framework of DiMPAH (Digital Methods Platform for Arts and Humanities), an online course \"e-spect@tor for performing arts\" has been designed to make available digital methods created by the Digital Humanities project \"The spectator's school\" to the scientific community and the students. The main aim of this course is to train learners to analyse performative works from video recordings. Those analysis are notably achieved with the use of the digital tool e-spect@tor developed by \"The spectator's school\" to annotate live art videos with different features that allows to study performative aspects. While \"Unit I\" is focused on introducing the \"Performing arts\", \"Unit II\" is dedicated to the analysis of case studies proposed to serve as models. The course can be used on e-learning and in a hybrid teaching format through a possible course structure and aims as described and tested with students. Furthermore, by using digital technology, this course can be at the forefront of new stories for Europe in terms of pedagogy as it trains to enable new media literacy and to analyse any activity that is staged such as political discourses, public meetings, or interviews.

        "Game-based learning has proven to be effective and is widely used in science education, but usually the heterogeneity of the student population is being overlooked. To examine the differential effects of game interventions in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) related subjects on diverse student groups, a meta-analysis has been conducted that included 39 studies that compared game-based learning interventions with traditional classrooms in primary and early secondary education. We found moderate positive effects on cognition (g =.67), motivation (g =.51), and behaviour (g =.93). Additionally, substantial heterogeneity between studies was found. Moderator analyses indicated that primary school students achieve higher learning outcomes and experience game interventions as more motivating than secondary school students, whereas gender did not have any moderating effect. There were too few studies reporting information on the remaining moderators (socioeconomic status, migration background, and special educational needs) to include them in a multiple meta-regression model. Therefore, we assessed their role by separate moderator analyses, but these results need to be interpreted with caution. Additional descriptive analyses suggested that game-based learning may be less beneficial for students with low socioeconomic status compared to students with high socioeconomic status.

        "This paper focuses on the use of language during the emergency eLearning period due to Covid-19 in the Basque Autonomous Community. Specifically, the main objective of this study is to analyze how the use of Basque (local minority language), English (foreign language), and Spanish (local majority language) changed during this period among children and the interactions that may exist between them. Four hundred eighty-four teachers and 410 parents participated in this research. The results revealed that teachers perceived a significant decline in the use of Basque that correlated with an increase in the use of Spanish. The decline in the use of Basque was particularly significant among children in kindergarten. The use of English also decreased but was not associated with the use of the other languages. It was also found that the perceptions of children's language use differed between teachers and parents. The findings are explained in terms of assumptions regarding language learning and use in relation to the context of the study. Finally, we discuss some implications of empowering minority and foreign language use in multilingual contexts during emergency eLearning and the measures that should be taken to mitigate the decline in their use at the current time.

        "This case study examines Indonesian first-grade teachers' emotions when teaching online during the pandemic. This study identifies teachers' emotions towards certain challenges in relation with parents, students, colleagues and school principals. The current study presents the challenges that teachers met and discusses it with emotional geographies theoretical framework. The findings indicate that teachers feel negative emotions and lead them to have emotional distances when encountering issues such as uncooperative parents, excessive working hours, limited resources, teacher–students alienation, learning loss, school-rule demands and colleagues disagreement. On the other hand, the teachers admitted that having cooperative parents and supportive school principals help them to feel positive. A collaborative support from schools, parents and governments is essentially needed to prevent a greater quality loss because of online learning in elementary schools, especially for first-grade students.

        "Recess is a critical source of physical, social and emotional health and well-being for children, but generally not prioritized during online learning. A 13-week structured recreation intervention was delivered virtually during recess to students in the fifth and sixth grades (age 10–12 years; N  = 71) at one elementary school (Phoenix, AZ, USA). We used embedded mixed method with a prospective pre-/post-design to measure change in student-reported emotion and qualities of engagement in an online setting. Students completed an online pre-/post-survey to measure emotion and motivational responses (enjoyment, competence and relatedness). We used narrative notes to qualitatively assess student engagement during programming. Differences in student-reported emotion were analyzed using paired t -tests. The effect of motivational responses on emotion was analyzed using multiple regression analyses. In vivo coding and concept coding were used to analyze qualitative data. We found no statistically significant differences in student-reported emotion; however, student relationships with peers predicted increased positive and decreased negative emotions after the intervention. Seven categories promoted student engagement: challenging, enjoyable, experiential, practical, purposeful, relatable and relevant. School-based health practitioners can offer structured activities virtually during recess, when in-person learning is interrupted and in all-online settings, to promote emotional well-being.

        "Online learning has significantly expanded along with the spread of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Personalization becomes an essential component of learning systems due to students' different learning styles and abilities. Recommending materials that meet the needs and are tailored to learners' styles and abilities is necessary to ensure a personalized learning system. The study conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) of papers on recommendation systems for e-learning in the K12 setting published between 2017 and 2021 and aims to identify the most important component of a personalized recommender system for school students' e-learning. Recommendations for later studies were proposed based on the identified components, namely a personalized conceptual framework for providing materials to school students. The proposed framework comprised four stages: student profiling, material collection, material filtering, and validation. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "Peer assessment (PA) is generally effective, and especially important for school teachers, as the experience might lead teachers to use PA more skilfully with school students. Digital PA (using computers) becomes more important as universities switch to online learning. This systematic review of research literature on digital PA for pre-service and in-service teachers encompasses: online/web-based, video, Massive Open Online Courses, digital frameworks to organize/structure PA, e-portfolios, Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs), Facebook, iPads and wikis. It contained 43 papers and all but one reported mainly positive effects. Potential moderator variables were considered, but studies rarely reported many of them. Few studies had control groups, only two reported Effect Sizes, and none reported implementation fidelity or follow-up. There was little evidence for carry-over of PA practices into later teaching of school children. However, the potential moderator variables provide a template for future reviews of PA and the design of PA by teachers. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "This article describes the challenge of engaging educators in professional development (PD) that is timely and relevant to their work, and effective in stimulating instructional changes to improve student learning. The authors highlight the competing needs and goals for PD that create tensions among the external accountability demands, school improvement goals, and the diverse and context-dependent professional learning needs of teachers. Two examples of large-scale PD initiatives in the US are described to illuminate how state accountability goals shaped these efforts, how teachers were engaged in PD, what factors or elements increased the relevancy and quality of the PD, and how leaders at various levels supported teachers' learning. These cases provide further insights about the role and challenges for leadership at the state, university and local levels to support and implement high quality PD. The authors argue that leadership plays a central role aligning accountability needs and teachers' professional learning needs and that technology, through hybrid and online learning environments, can support high quality PD that is customised for the needs of teachers and schools.

        "Reading is one of the crucial aspects of the learning process. The learning efficiency depends on the motivation and involvement of students. The paper aims to determine whether the developed online course enhances student motivation and engagement in contemporary American literature. For this purpose, questionnaires were used. The sample consisted of 126 students enrolled in Yulin Gaoxin Secondary School, who had English proficiency at a high enough level to read English literature in the original language. Before and after the course, the Reading Motivation Questionnaires test was administered, with its scores validated using Student's t-test for dependent samples. Significant progress is observed in the internal and social components of motivation (23–25%), as well as in the Engagement category (31%). The course also positively affected learning effectiveness. None of the participants scored less than half of the possible points for the course assignments. Most children obtained high (95–119 points) and very high scores (120–140 points). This finding demonstrates the suitability of the tools used (videoconferencing, learning management systems, discussion forums, and interactive exercises) in online learning when studying modern literature. The research findings are of interest, first of all, to instructors who adopt technological innovations in their lessons or want to motivate students to read. Second, school administrators and education sector officials can draw information from the findings for corrective action. Third, software developers may be inspired by the data and create new technology solutions. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "In this study, an integrated collaborative learning and knowledge map approach was developed for online teacher professional development. An online teacher education environment based on that approach was constructed. To investigate the interaction between the knowledge map and collaborative learning strategies on teachers' learning performance and self-efficacy of group learning, a 2 × 2 experiment was acted out. The study subjects were 179 in-service teachers from primary schools in China. The participants were divided into four groups to learn theories and cases of educational research methods using different online learning strategies (individual learning or collaborative learning) and knowledge map strategies (using a knowledge map or not). The results revealed two notable findings. First, both the knowledge map and collaborative learning strategies were significantly conducive to enhance the teachers' learning performance. Second, the interaction between the two kinds of strategies showed that the knowledge map strategy was potential to promote the self-efficacy of group learning among teachers who used the collaborative learning strategy. Thus, we conclude that the collaborative construction of group knowledge map could be an effective approach to promote teachers' knowledge construction and provide visual interaction support for teachers' online professional development.

        "Recently, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to rapid digitalisation in education, requiring educators to adopt several technologies simultaneously for online learning and teaching. Using a large-scale survey (N = 1740), this study aims to construct a model that predicts teachers' extensive technology acceptance by extending the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) with their technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK) and innovativeness. TAM has been a valuable tool to measure the adoption of new technology in various contexts, including education. However, TAM has been designed and principally applied to assess user acceptance of a specific technology implementation. This study has extended TAM to measure teachers' technology-enabled practice (online teaching) with the adoption of various technologies. The proposed model explains teachers' behavioural intention to teach online with a good fit. Our findings revealed the collective effects of TPACK, perceived usefulness (PU) of technology, and innovativeness on teachers' behavioural intention to teach online post-pandemic. Moreover, the study identified training and support from school as a significant predictor for both teachers' TPACK and PU. The novelty of this study lies in its model conceptualisation that incorporates both information-technology-based constructs and personal-competence-based features, including TPACK and innovativeness. Furthermore, our study contributes to the growing body of literature that addresses the online teaching adoption by schoolteachers in the post-pandemic era. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "This study investigates two extensive reading (ER) programmes carried out in a secondary school in Beijing during the COVID-19 pandemic, with the aim of analysing how differentiated instruction (DI) is reflected in the ER implementation and how this forced online learning inform foreign/second language (L2) pedagogy in relation to ER and DI. Adopting an exploratory case study approach, the study collected data from multiple sources: interview with six students and two teachers; questionnaire survey (N = 74 + 27); teachers' reflective journal; documents related to the two reading programmes. Data collection lasted for a semester (six months). Thematic analysis was used to code and interpret data. Following the five-category framework for differentiated instruction (Tomlinson, C. A., and T. Moon. 2013. Assessment and Student Success in a Differentiated Classroom. Alexandria: Association for Supervision & Curriculum Development), this study collects evidence of DI implementation in terms of content (three-tiered system of providing reading materials), process (personalised reading frequency and quantity), and product (diversified forms/platforms of presentation of reading results) of the reading programmes. However, due to the online teaching mode, DI was not fully reflected in aspects of affect (inadequate collaborative activities and interaction between students and teacher) and learning environment (lack of studying-together atmosphere). Results also indicate a widening gap between higher and lower achieving learners regarding engagement with ER activities due to differences in student autonomy and parental involvement. This study provides some insights into differentiated instruction in ER implementation in the lockdown period, and proposes implications for L2 pedagogical design and innovation with a DI approach to ER.

        "Technology is transforming children's lived experience with spatial play. In particular, parents may interact with children differently depending on whether they play together with tangible or digital materials. The present research examined whether the medium for play (tangible or digital) affected kindergarten‐aged children's language experience during puzzle play and explored immediate effects on spatial reasoning. Sixty parent–child dyads played with a tangible or a digital set of tangram puzzles for 10 minutes; children received the Children's Mental Transformation Task (CMTT) before and after the play session. Their performance on the most challenging problems of the CMTT improved after tangible, but not digital, play. This effect was related to parental use of orientation and transformation words during the play session and unrelated to the success of puzzle completion. Moreover, we found that the digital interface, specifically the prescribed movements to use the app, affected parental use of deictic words (eg, here, there), and that this relation may be driven by children's production of a pointing‐like action. Together, these results shed light on the interaction between material for play, parent spatial talk and children's spatial reasoning. Practitioner notesWhat is already known The use of touchscreen devices for play by children has become increasingly common.Parents tend to engage children in device‐relevant talk more than task‐relevant talk when using electronic devices.Hands‐on experience with tangible materials provides short‐term and long‐term benefits on children's spatial reasoning.What this paper adds With their parents, children at 5 to 6 years completed more puzzles of tangible materials than of digital materials; the design interface of the digital puzzles affected children's action experience.Tangible materials invited parents to talk about orientation and transformation more than digital materials. The design interface that prompted children to produce pointing‐like gestures invited parents to use more deictic words (eg, here, there).Children's spatial reasoning was elevated after playing with tangible (but not digital) puzzles. This elevation was related to parental talk about orientation and transformation.Implications for practice and/or policy This study sheds light on the considerations for parents and educators when choosing tangible or digital materials for children to engage in spatial play.The results inform about design principles of educational technology for spatial learning by children at the kindergarten age.

        "Integrating digital technology in education is challenging. This study reports on three high school mathematics classes where teachers attempted to improve their teaching and student learning by using a digital tool. For analysis we use the Information System Artifact model Lee et al. (2015) which distinguishes between three integrated sub-artifacts, the technological, the informational and the social and the Structurational Practice Lens to educational technology Halperin (2017). Using interviews and observations we find the major obstacle for student learning is a less developed social artifact. Students have difficulties using the tool effectively when teachers do not work to develop shared practices in technology use. When teachers do not themselves use the tool actively, they do not fully understand how students can learn from it, neither can they help them in synthesizing teacher- and tool instructions. Students end up having \"two masters\" competing rather than integrated teacher instruction and technology assistance. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "To date, many AI initiatives (eg, AI4K12, CS for All) developed standards and frameworks as guidance for educators to create accessible and engaging Artificial Intelligence (AI) learning experiences for K‐12 students. These efforts revealed a significant need to prepare youth to gain a fundamental understanding of how intelligence is created, applied, and its potential to perpetuate bias and unfairness. This study contributes to the growing interest in K‐12 AI education by examining student learning of modelling real‐world text data. Four students from an Advanced Placement computer science classroom at a public high school participated in this study. Our qualitative analysis reveals that the students developed nuanced and in‐depth understandings of how text classification models—a type of AI application—are trained. Specifically, we found that in modelling texts, students: (1) drew on their social experiences and cultural knowledge to create predictive features, (2) engineered predictive features to address model errors, (3) described model learning patterns from training data and (4) reasoned about noisy features when comparing models. This study contributes to an initial understanding of student learning of modelling unstructured data and offers implications for scaffolding in‐depth reasoning about model decision making. Practitioner notes: What is already known about this topic Scholarly attention has turned to examining Artificial Intelligence (AI) literacy in K‐12 to help students understand the working mechanism of AI technologies and critically evaluate automated decisions made by computer models.While efforts have been made to engage students in understanding AI through building machine learning models with data, few of them go in‐depth into teaching and learning of feature engineering, a critical concept in modelling data.There is a need for research to examine students' data modelling processes, particularly in the little‐researched realm of unstructured data. What this paper adds Results show that students developed nuanced understandings of models learning patterns in data for automated decision making.Results demonstrate that students drew on prior experience and knowledge in creating features from unstructured data in the learning task of building text classification models.Students needed support in performing feature engineering practices, reasoning about noisy features and exploring features in rich social contexts that the data set is situated in. Implications for practice and/or policy It is important for schools to provide hands‐on model building experiences for students to understand and evaluate automated decisions from AI technologies.Students should be empowered to draw on their cultural and social backgrounds as they create models and evaluate data sources.To extend this work, educators should consider opportunities to integrate AI learning in other disciplinary subjects (ie, outside of computer science classes).

        "Predictions about the post‐pandemic future of digital learning vary among higher education scholars. Some foresee dramatic, revolutionary change while others speculate that growth in educational technology will be buffeted both by modest expansion and unevenness. To this debate we contribute evidence from four groups across six countries on four continents: college and university educators (n = 281), students (n = 4243), senior administrators (n = 15), and instructional design specialists (n = 43). Our focus is on the future of digital learning after the pandemic‐induced pivot to emergency remote instruction. Using data from interviews and self‐administered questionnaires, our findings reveal a high degree of congruency between respondent groups, with most envisioning more blended/hybrid instruction post‐pandemic and some modest increases in fully online courses. Student opinion is more sceptical about future change than within the other groups. Among respondents in all groups there is little expectation for a full‐blown, revolutionary change in online or digital learning. Practitioner notesWhat is already known about this topic Digital learning has been growing in higher education, although a digital disconnect continues whereby the availability of educational technology exceeds its application to learning.Expectations regarding technology‐mediated learning post‐COVID‐19 are mixed, hampering planning for the future.Hesitancy about teaching or taking courses with some or full online components persists.What this paper adds A strong majority of respondents in higher education foresee the most growth in blended/hybrid forms of digital learning post‐COVID‐19.A solid percentage, between about two‐thirds and three‐quarters of faculty and students, envision learners and instructors taking or teaching more fully online courses post‐pandemic.A strong congruency exists between faculty, students, senior administrators, and instructional design professionals in their ranking of scenarios for the future of digital learning.Implications for practice and/or policy Educational technology in higher learning will not return to a pre‐COVID‐19 normality—if a pre‐COVID‐19 'normal' could even be defined.As post‐pandemic institutional planning unfolds, it is important to reflect experiences and incorporate insights of instructors, students, and instructional designers.Successfully building on these insights, where more blended/hybrid learning is foreseen, requires a thoughtful integration of face‐to‐face learning and educational technology.

        "Predicting students' performance in advance could help assist the learning process; if \"at-risk\" students can be identified early on, educators can provide them with the necessary educational support. Despite this potential advantage, the technology for predicting students' performance has not been widely used in education due to practical limitations. We propose a practical method to predict students' performance in the educational environment using machine learning and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques. We conducted qualitative research to ascertain the perspectives of educational stakeholders. Twelve people, including educators, parents of K-12 students, and policymakers, participated in a focus group interview. The initial practical features were chosen based on the participants' responses. Then, a final version of the practical features was selected through correlation analysis. In addition, to verify whether at-risk students could be distinguished using the selected features, we experimented with various machine learning algorithms: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Multi-Layer Perceptron, Support Vector Machine, XGBoost, LightGBM, VTC, and STC. As a result of the experiment, Logistic Regression showed the best overall performance. Finally, information intended to help each student was visually provided using the XAI technique.

        "Using Critical Design (CD) and Participatory Design (PD) as analytical and normative vantage points, this contribution reflects on how characteristics of both approaches can be useful for a reflective and inclusive engagement with educational technology in school development processes. Illustrating initial empirical findings from the research project Smart Schools, we analyse how characteristics of CD and PD are challenged or affirmed when unfolding in school practice. Our data show how three key logics substantially challenge ideas of CD and PD in digital school development processes, namely: (1) the idea of digital school development as a set of sequential processes; (2) an understanding of digital and analogue as opposing conditions; and (3) the conceptualisation of knowledge hierarchies between students, teachers, and external stakeholders. Simultaneously, we observe perspectives that affirm both approaches. Consequently, we argue that the notions of critique and participation must be rethought to apply CD and PD in everyday school development processes. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "Most children and young people (CYP) worldwide are classified as inactive because they fail to meet the World Health Organisation recommendations for physical activity. Online interventions that use devices like exergames, smartphones, social media, and wearables have the potential to improve physical activity engagement because of their extensive reach and opportunities for learning and use across contexts. The objectives of this systematic review were to update the evidence-base on online physical activity interventions for CYP since 2015, analyse the outcomes associated with online interventions across physical, cognitive, social and affective domains, and assess the mechanisms (i.e. pedagogical strategies) of online interventions that resulted in outcomes related to physical activity. A systematic search of the literature was conducted across 4 databases (MEDLINE, PudMed, EBSCO and EMBASE) using key words related to online interventions, physical activity and CYP. The inclusion criteria were: CYP aged 5–18 years in the general population; use of an online-based medium to deliver an intervention related to physical activity; outcomes related to changes to physical activity, and in physical, cognitive, social and affective domains; and quantitative, qualitative and mixed methods studies. A modified version of the Quality Assessment Tool for Studies with Diverse Designs was used to assess study quality. A mixed methods approach was used to analyse and synthesise all evidence. 26 papers were identified as meeting the inclusion criteria, including randomised control trials (n=8), non-randomised interventions (n=12), observational studies (n=3) and qualitative papers (n=3). The target population of most studies was children (<12 years) where data collection mostly took place in a school setting, in elementary schools, and in physical education lessons. The interventions reported on positive changes to CYP's physical activity behaviours, through increases in physical activity levels and emotions, attitudes and motivations toward physical activity. Gamification and personalisation were the main mechanisms of online interventions that elicited positive changes in behaviours. The studies in this review provide a convincing rationale for the use of online interventions to support CYP's engagement with physical activity, due to the positive effects on physical and affective outcomes. New evidence is provided on the key mechanisms of online interventions (gamification and personalised learning) and the contexts in which online interventions are likely to be effective (elementary school PE) that can be used by health and education practitioners, organisations, policy makers and/or researchers to reach and engage CYP in physical activity. This study had some limitations that mainly relate to variation in study design, over-reliance of self-reported measures, and sample characteristics, that prevented comparative analysis.

        "Machine learning and other artificial intelligence (AI) technologies are predicted to play a transformative role in primary education, where these technologies for automation and personalization are now being introduced to classroom instruction. This article explores the rationales and practices by which machine learning and AI are emerging in schools. We report on ethnographic fieldwork in Sweden, where a machine learning teaching aid in mathematics, the AI Engine, was tried out by 22 teachers and more than 250 primary education students. By adopting an Actor‐Network Theory approach, the analysis focuses on the interactions within the network of heterogeneous actors bound by the AI Engine as an obligatory passage point. The findings show how the actions and accounts emerging within the complex ecosystem of human actors compensate for the unexpected and undesirable algorithmic decisions of the AI Engine. We discuss expectations about AI in education, contradictions in how the AI Engine worked and uncertainties about how machine learning algorithms 'learn' and predict. These factors contribute to our understanding of the potential of automation and personalisation—a process that requires continued re‐negotiations. The findings are presented in the form of a fictional play in two acts, an ethnodrama. The ethnodrama highlights controversies in the use of AI in education, such as the lack of transparency in algorithmic decision‐making—and how this can play out in real‐life learning contexts. The findings of this study contribute to a better understanding of AI in primary education. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "Gamification is typically implemented digitally. However, digital gamification is not always possible because of limited resources and logistical problems. It is thus necessary to explore low‐threshold gamification methods that can be easily adopted in classrooms. One such method is non‐digital gamification using physical game design elements. Currently, the literature provides a limited understanding of the design and effects of non‐digital gamification. It is also unclear whether mixed gamification (ie, a combination of digital and non‐digital gamification) is better than purely non‐digital gamification. We explored these topics using an explanatory sequential mixed‐methods design to compare the effectiveness of non‐digital gamification in a face‐to‐face course and mixed gamification in a blended course in terms of student learning achievement, cognitive engagement and course satisfaction. Two secondary grade classes were randomly assigned to the mixed (N = 52) or non‐digital (N = 52) gamification conditions. Contrary to our expectations, the quantitative results showed that the two approaches improved the students' learning achievement to the same extent. Although the students in the non‐digital gamification condition reported significantly higher‐course satisfaction than those in the mixed condition, the improvement in student cognitive engagement was significantly greater in the mixed gamification condition than in the non‐digital condition. Through focus group interviews, we analysed the students' learning experiences and synthesised the factors that influenced student cognitive engagement and course satisfaction. Practitioner notesWhat is already known about this topic Gamification is increasingly being used to increase student engagement and enhance learning.Gamification studies have mostly focused on digital modes, which often require gamified digital platforms or applications.Non‐digital gamification can be an effective method to foster learning, but the design and evaluation of non‐digital gamification is at an early stage.What this paper adds We designed non‐digital and mixed (ie, a combination of digital and non‐digital) gamification programmes and compared their effects using an explanatory sequential mixed‐methods design.Both gamification approaches led to a similar improvement in learning achievement.While non‐digital gamification fostered students' course satisfaction, mixed gamification was more effective in improving students' cognitive engagement.Implications for practice and/or policy Non‐digital gamification can be an effective low‐threshold solution for instructors. It is worth further improving the non‐digital gamification approach in school settings as it is cost‐effective and can be transferred between classrooms.The benefits of mixed gamification should not be ignored because of its affordances that improve students' cognitive engagement.

        "This article considers the challenges of using artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to assist high‐stakes standardised assessment. It focuses on the detrimental effect that even state‐of‐the‐art AI and ML systems could have on the validity of national exams of secondary education, and how lower validity would negatively affect trust in the system. To reach this conclusion, three unresolved issues in AI (unreliability, low explainability and bias) are addressed, to show how each of them would compromise the interpretations and uses of exam results (i.e., exam validity). Furthermore, the article relates validity to trust, and specifically to the ABI+ model of trust. Evidence gathered as part of exam validation supports each of the four trust‐enabling components of the ABI+ model (ability, benevolence, integrity and predictability). It is argued, therefore, that the three AI barriers to exam validity limit the extent to which an AI‐assisted exam system could be trusted. The article suggests that addressing the issues of AI unreliability, low explainability and bias should be sufficient to put AI‐assisted exams on par with traditional ones, but might not go as far as fully reassure the public. To achieve this, it is argued that changes to the quality assurance mechanisms of the exam system will be required. This may involve, for example, integrating principled AI frameworks in assessment policy and regulation. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "This paper examines the online marketing of digital technologies in education from three multi-national technology corporations' websites focusing on both the language used in the text and the nature of the accompanying images. Through a content analysis, the paper shows the ways in which the need for technology investment is rationalised. It also highlights how the need for educational reform drives much of the discourse in relation to K-12 education whereas, within the higher education sites, alignment with existing practices is emphasised. The analysis of the sites highlights the veiled ways in which digital futures are presented and how the corporations and their products and services are positioned. The paper highlights how educational technology advertising capitalises on new public management practices in education to a target school and university management in the promotion and marketing of educational technology – largely by-passing those working at the coalface of education.

        "The COVID‐19 pandemic disrupted education across the world as campuses closed to restrict the spread of the virus. UK universities swiftly migrated to online delivery. The experiences of students and staff during this transition can inform our return to campus and our ability to deal with future disruption. This study draws on Moore's theory of transactional distance to understand factors influencing student study skills engagement and participation in online learning during this period. We surveyed students (n = 178) in a computing school at a UK university. A partial least squares (PLS) analysis was used to explore the influence of transactional distance (between students/teachers and between students/students), access to e‐learning capital, and perceived usefulness on two measures: study skills engagement and participation in online collaborative activity. Results show that transactional distance influences participation, and e‐learning capital influences study skills engagement. Our findings suggest that if universities continue with aspects of online learning for previously on‐campus students they should provide access to infrastructure and training on utilising the online ecosystem to avoid disadvantaging students. Further investment in students' e‐learning capital, such as signposting and adapting existing resources, is also necessary to support this key influence in study skills engagement. Practitioner notesWhat is already known about this topicMoore's transactional distance theory recognises that the significant distance of distance learning is not of time or place, but rather a communication and psychological distance between the learner and teacher that is affected by the structure of the course, the dialogue between the learner and teacher, and the autonomy of the learners. Transactional distance affects student engagement.Studies using Davis' technology acceptance model have found perceived usefulness of the virtual learning environment to be an important factor in student engagement with online learning.Computer self‐efficacy is a factor related to engagement with digital learning technologies.What this paper addsThis study identifies the relationship between factors of transactional distance (transactional distance between student and teacher TDST and transactional distance between students TDSS) with study skills engagement and participation, as mediated by perceived usefulness.We introduce the term e‐learning capital as a measure of self‐expressed ability (skills and resources) to utilise the online learning environment. This e‐learning capital influences students study skills engagement but not participation.Transactional distance between students and teacher did not directly affect study skills engagement or participation.Low student‐student transactional distance positively affects participation in online activities and this relationship is mediated by perceived usefulness of these activities.Implications for practice and/or policyUniversities should draw on this study's findings in order to focus on students' online study skills engagement and participation for any future online or hybrid online and face‐to‐face learning.Further investment in students' e‐learning capital is necessary as a key influence in study skills engagement and this should be reflected in university policies.Lecturers should direct efforts to signposting the value of participation and academic advisors should reframe practical advice relating to study skills for online learners.This cohort effect of student‐student transactions should be encouraged further in online learning activities, including facilitating sharing study approaches.

        "Emergency remote teaching (ERT) has potential for transforming future instruction and learning across the K–12 educational domain. The study presented here evaluated empirical evidence from peer-reviewed literature pertaining to the challenges and opportunities experienced by teachers and students during the implementation of ERT prompted by the COVID-19 pandemic. To locate relevant reports and research, the authors explored three databases: Web of Science, ScienceDirect and Scopus. Based upon predefined selection criteria, they selected 51 studies for thematic and content analysis. Next, they developed a taxonomy which comprised three categories: (1) K–12 education responses to ERT; (2) educational inequality; and (3) learning outcomes. Using this taxonomy, the authors conducted a deep analysis and critical review to highlight multiple challenges and critical gaps in the literature surrounding ERT in K–12 education settings. Their review reveals innovative strategies for overcoming obstacles to technological readiness, online learning adaptation and teachers' and students' physical and mental health. This knowledge will be valuable to policymakers, researchers, practitioners and educational institutions in reducing the adverse effects of catastrophic situations on childhood education in the future.

        "This paper focuses on the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development's (OECD) PISA for Schools assessment. Our first substantive focus is a descriptive and analytical account of changes and developments in the functioning of this ground-breaking assessment since its creation in 2012. These changes include an expansion of the number and diversity of participating schools and countries, the introduction of a 'user-pays' model, the enhanced role of edtech firms and an explicit capacity-building focus, which we argue helps to strengthen an instrument constituency for the broader OECD testing regime. The second focus of the paper is the impact of PISA for Schools on changing modes of educational governance, situated against emerging spatialities of globalisation. Here, we provide an analysis using the concept of 'by-passes', which we elaborate as spatial, governance and systemic, to understand the new topological spatialities of globalisation and the global governance effects of these specific by-passes.

        "Society is continually evolving and the needs of current generations of students are changing, deriving from the ongoing digital evolution of the whole of society. Gamification tools are increasingly being implemented in education, since previous studies have demonstrated their usefulness to foster motivation, particularly in the case of engineering students. For that reason, there is a great need to continue providing empirical evidence of experiences proving the positive consequences of new active learning tools. In this work, a video-game (which would be catalogued as a serious game in the literature) was implemented in a subject traditionally perceived by the students as very complex, at the School of Engineering in Cádiz (Spain). The purpose of the video-game was to provide an entertaining way to review the theoretical concepts taught during the lessons. Since the video-game was successful, another one was developed with the same environment but the theoretical contents of another part of the subject. After implementing the first game, which was played by N = 311 students, 94% of them stated that the game increased their motivation in the subject, and also that the games were very easy to use, very helpful to review the subject and enjoyable. Also, the students who played the games obtained a higher performance compared to the rest (around + 36% higher passing rates). Last of all, a t-student analysis revealed that the mean differences between the exam scores obtained by students who played the games and the exam scores of those who did not play were significant for both games. The impact of gender was also investigated, showing that gender had a small influence on the rating given to the games. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "Socially shared regulation contributes to the success of collaborative learning. However, the assessment of socially shared regulation of learning (SSRL) faces several challenges in the effort to increase the understanding of collaborative learning and support outcomes due to the unobservability of the related cognitive and emotional processes. The recent development of trace‐based assessment has enabled innovative opportunities to overcome the problem. Despite the potential of a trace‐based approach to study SSRL, there remains a paucity of evidence on how trace‐based evidence could be captured and utilised to assess and promote SSRL. This study aims to investigate the assessment of electrodermal activities (EDA) data to understand and support SSRL in collaborative learning, hence enhancing learning outcomes. The data collection involves secondary school students (N = 94) working collaboratively in groups through five science lessons. A multimodal data set of EDA and video data were examined to assess the relationship among shared arousals and interactions for SSRL. The results of this study inform the patterns among students' physiological activities and their SSRL interactions to provide trace‐based evidence for an adaptive and maladaptive pattern of collaborative learning. Furthermore, our findings provide evidence about how trace‐based data could be utilised to predict learning outcomes in collaborative learning. Practitioner notesWhat is already known about this topic Socially shared regulation has been recognised as an essential aspect of collaborative learning success.It is challenging to make the processes of learning regulation 'visible' to better understand and support student learning, especially in dynamic collaborative settings.Multimodal learning analytics are showing promise for being a powerful tool to reveal new insights into the temporal and sequential aspects of regulation in collaborative learning.What this paper adds Utilising multimodal big data analytics to reveal the regulatory patterns of shared physiological arousal events (SPAEs) and regulatory activities in collaborative learning.Providing evidence of using multimodal data including physiological signals to indicate trigger events in socially shared regulation.Examining the differences of regulatory patterns between successful and less successful collaborative learning sessions.Demonstrating the potential use of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to predict collaborative learning success by examining regulatory patterns.Implications for practice and/or policy Our findings offer insights into how students regulate their learning during collaborative learning, which can be used to design adaptive supports that can foster students' learning regulation.This study could encourage researchers and practitioners to consider the methodological development incorporating advanced techniques such as AI machine learning for capturing, processing and analysing multimodal data to examine and support learning regulation.

        "Background: Formative assessments are vital for supporting learning and performance but are also considered to increase the workload of teachers. As self‐assessments in higher education are increasingly facilitated via digital learning environments allowing to offer direct feedback and tracking students' digital learning behaviour these constraints might be reduced. Yet, learning analytics do not make sufficient use of data on assessments. Aims: This exploratory case study uses learning analytics methods for investigating students' engagement with self‐assessments and how this relates to performance in the final exam and self‐reported self‐testing strategies. Materials & Methods: The research study has been conducted at a European university in a twelve‐weeks course of a Bachelor's program in Economic and Business Education including nenroll = 159 participants. During the semester, students were offered nine self‐assessments each including three to eight tasks plus one mid‐term and one exam‐preparation self‐assessment including all prior self‐assessments tasks. The self‐assessment interaction data for each student included: the results of the last self‐assessment attempt, the number of processed self‐assessment tasks, and the time spent on the last self‐assessment attempt, the total self‐assessment attempts, and the first as well as last access of each self‐assessment. Data analytics included unsupervised machine learning and process mining approaches. Results: Findings indicate that students use the self‐assessments predominantly before summative assessments. Two distinct clusters based on engagement with self‐assessments could be identified and engagement was positively related to performance in the final exam. The findings from learning analytics data were also indicated by students' self‐reported use of self‐testing strategies. Discussion: With the help of multiple data from self‐reports, formal exams, and a learning analytics system, the findings provided multiple perspectives on the use of self‐assessments and their relationships with course performance. These findings call for applying assessment analytics and related frameworks in learning analytics as well as providing learners with related adaptive feedback. Conclusion: Future research might investigate different (self‐report) variables for clustering, other student cohorts or self‐assessment forms. Lay Description: What is already known about this topic: Formative assessments are vital for supporting learning and performance.Learning analytics do not make sufficient use of data on assessments. What this paper adds: Students use the self‐assessments predominantly prior to summative assessments.Engagement with self‐assessments was positively related to performance in the final exam. Implications for practice and/or policy: Findings call for applying assessment analytics and implementing related learning analytics frameworks for supporting learning processes and performance.Pedagogically oriented assessment analytics may provide multiple benefits for learners, teachers, schools, and other involved stakeholders.

        "In order to explore whether STEAM education in combination with elementary school curriculums can help students' learning performance, this study developed a digital learning system. This digital learning system combined STEAM concepts with elements of gamebased learning. This study developed the curriculum content based on the unit of transportation vehicles and presented it in a digital learning manner. In the experiment, the students were divided into an experimental group and a control group. The experimental group students were given the system developed in this study to assist their learning, and the control group students the lecturer-centered narrative curriculum. The study results show that the experimental group was superior to the control group in learning effectiveness. In the aspect of cognitive load, the cognitive load generated by the experimental group in their learning activities was also lower than that of the control group. By classifying students according to their learning styles, the visual type students had better learning effectiveness than the verbal type students when learning through the system developed by this graduate institute. As for the sequential type and global type students learning with the system developed, there were no significant differences in their learning effectiveness. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "Background: Globally, digital skills are a crucial aspect of education that schools should develop systematically. Research on digital skills tends to be measured using self‐reports, performance tests or interventions. There is less knowledge about student and teacher uptake of technology in school, making it important to investigate the actual use of technology and digital skills in authentic classroom settings. Objectives: This study contributes unique baseline data concerning students' use of technology and digital skills across mandatory English courses in real classroom settings in secondary schools in Norway over time. Methods: The study adapted a national framework for digital skills into an observation protocol. With it, this study analysed videos from 60 naturally occurring English lessons in 13 English classes at seven lower secondary schools over two school years (grades 9 and 10), following 186 students (aged 13–15) and 10 teachers. Results and Conclusions: Students used digital skills critical for education in half of the video‐recorded English lessons, with more digital skill use at some schools over time. The main finding across classrooms and school years regards students' use of basic, not advanced, digital skills. Takeaways: Although teachers provide opportunities for students to use digital skills in school, more advanced skills are needed. This work calls for continued use of video recordings to provide systematic comparisons of potential shifts in students' digital skills in real English secondary classroom settings over time. Lay Description: What is currently known: Digital skills is a crucial aspect of education globallyStudent and teacher uptake of technology varies extensivelyMost studies on the use of digital technology concern self‐reports and interventionsFew studies exist concerning the actual use of digital skills in the classroom What this paper adds: Video recordings from seven English classrooms across two school years are analysed.A framework for digital skills is adopted and used as observation protocolAttention is given to the difference between basic and advanced digital skillsHow technology is actually used matters more than how much technology is available Implications of study findings for practitioners: Teachers should offer opportunities for students' use of digital skills in the classroomSubject‐specific use of digital skills should be prioritizedThere is a need for more emphasis on reflection and digital judgementWe need to encourage the use of advanced digital skills and not only basic skills [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "Background: Online learning and teaching were globally popularized due to the impact of Covid‐19. The pandemic has made both synchronous and asynchronous online learning inevitable in regions privileged with the technological affordance. Aims: This study was designed to examine and compare the effectiveness of both learning modes through the Community of Inquiry framework. Materials & Methods: Comparative analyses on a sample of N = 170 undergraduate students who took both synchronous and asynchronous online courses in Spring 2021. Results: The paired‐sample T‐tests results indicated a significant difference in social presence, cognitive presence and self‐evaluated performance. Discussion & Conclusion: Teaching presence significantly influenced social presence and cognitive presence in both learning modes. However, under synchronous learning mode, social presence significantly impacted self‐evaluation, grades and school identification. While social presence only influenced school identification under asynchronous learning mode. Theoretical and practical implications were also included. Lay Description: This paper is particularly informative as a comparative study, because we sampled students who had both synchronous online courses and asynchronous online courses in the Spring 2021 semester. And we only compared students' experiences within themselves using paired‐sample T‐tests, meaning that we compared the learning experience of the same person under two learning modes, rather than compare two samples.Although synchronous learning and asynchronous learning are both online learning methods, students had significant different experience in social presence and cognitive presence in the two learning modes, and had significantly higher self‐evaluated performance in synchronous learning mode. They learned in a more socially engaged and cognitively engaged way in synchronous online courses.Through structural equation modelling tests, we found that social presence was the most important factor in synchronous online courses. It impacts students' self‐evaluation, grades, and identification to their attended schools. However, in asynchronous learning mode, teaching presence was the most important factor.What is particularly interesting is that social presence leads to lower self‐evaluated performance, but higher grades in synchronous learning environment. Students might dislike the fact that they had to talk and discuss in online courses just like in face‐to‐face courses and they'd rather sit back and do the assignment without synchronous instructions. But, they do better without social interactions in synchronous class meetings. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "What will happen if students cannot go to school and can rely on online learning? This study aimed to examine whether students' basic learning needs could be met when teaching and learning can only be conducted through online mode. According to Ormrod (2011), the four basic learning needs are arousal, autonomy, relatedness and competence, which were used as the theoretical framework for this study. Mixed methods were used to evaluate whether basic learning needs were met. A total of 118 school students were recruited to a validated questionnaire and 36 of them joined an individual in-depth interview. Results showed that the basic learning needs of autonomy and competence were met through online learning but not the need of relatedness. Autonomy was found to have direct relationship with competence but not relatedness nor there was any relationship between arousal and other learning needs. It was so found that positive and adequate negative arousal could serve as a catalyst to facilitate effective online learning. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "Metaverse is understood with technological terms such as augmented reality, lifelogging, mirrored worlds, and virtual worlds, and using a metaverse platform is considered an emerging form of learning. Yet, its pedagogical features, such as self‐learning, collaborative learning, and learning‐by‐doing, are identical to those of online learning. In this study, we argue that metaverse‐based learning refers to a new reality learners create by assuming that the existence of reality is different in the metaverse. We extracted six educational values in epistemological and ontological senses, reviewing the four realities of the metaverse, including virtual reality, augmented reality, mixed reality, and extended reality, which is a way to avoid technological determinists'; approach to education. Based on the values – bottom‐up, collaboration, authorship, ownership, interconnectivity, and community, primary school children's (year 5 & 6) groups (n = 20) redesigned 20 assigned school spaces such as classroom teacher office, science room, and music room on their chosen metaverse platforms. Throughout the thematic analysis of design artifacts, activity scenarios, and reflection & presentation, we discovered four themes: collaborative learning with co‐ownership and co‐authorship; being interconnected with all living and non‐living things; co‐participants with different roles; and transdisciplinary research‐driven learning, which is used to articulate a framework for metaverse‐based learning, which is different from online learning.

        "Online teaching has globally become a part of the learning process and has been more well-established in developed countries. In developing countries, online teaching or e-Learning is not practiced or recognized officially by educational organizations and policymakers. On the other hand, it is well-known that computers and technology are the future; in such a case, the advancement of distance-learning or online learning is immensely remarkable. It has reduced teachers' and students' introversion concerning e-learning and technology and has provided a platform for learning new technologies and developing new skills. The recent COVID-19 lockdown impelled governments to start implementing E-learning in schools, which resulted in several challenges. This study attempts to analyze and interpret the challenges and potentials of implementing online learning by surveying through an online questionnaire using 'Google Forms' (N = 968) with responses from high school and primary school English teachers during the first week of March through the last week of April. The findings revealed that most teachers had negative perceptions of implementing e-learning for several reasons, including lack of essential facilities such as electricity, electronic devices, and the absence of required skills. The actual contributions of students and educators are also among the major obstacles. This research suggests introducing Information Communication Technology modules across media platforms and applications in the education departments, opening intensive courses for teachers, and developing educational facilities in the education departments and schools to overcome these limitations and challenges.

        "Background: Self‐regulated learning (SRL) ability is the key determinant of the success of full‐time online learning. Thus, exploring the influencing factors of SRL and their influencing mechanisms is necessary to improve this ability among K‐12 students. Objectives: The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence mechanism of teacher autonomy support on students' online SRL by examining the structural relationship among teacher autonomy support, parental autonomy support, students' self‐efficacy, and students' online SRL. Methods: We use structural equation modelling and effect analysis to analyse the collected data from 961 Chinese K‐12 students who engaged in full‐time online learning in their homes during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) outbreak. Results and Conclusions: Parental autonomy support and students' self‐efficacy play crucial independent mediating roles in the influence of teacher autonomy support on students' online SRL. Parental autonomy support and students' self‐efficacy have a chain mediating effect on the influence of teacher autonomy support on students' online SRL. Implications: On the basis of the results, we suggest that in order to develop students' online SRL ability, it is important for teacher to improve parental autonomy support and students' self‐efficacy. In addition, base on the chain mediating effect, to improve students' online SRL, teacher autonomy support needs focus on parental autonomy support, and then parental autonomy support needs focus on improving students' self‐efficacy. Lay Description: What is already known about this topic: • Self‐regulated learning (SRL) ability is the key determinant of the success of online learning. • To improve K‐12 students' SRL ability, it is important to explore the influencing factors and their influencing mechanisms on students' online SRL. • Teacher autonomy support play an important role for students' learning. What is not known about this topic?: • How does teacher autonomy support influence students' online SRL, especially in full‐time online learning? • Do parental autonomy support and student' self‐efficacy play a chain mediating role in the influence of teacher autonomy support on students' online SRL? What this paper adds: • Parental autonomy support and students' self‐efficacy play crucial independent mediating role in the influence of teacher autonomy support on students' online SRL. • Teacher autonomy support has a indirect influence on students' online SRL through the chain mediating effect of parental autonomy support and students' self‐efficacy. Implications for practice and/or policy: • Given that parental autonomy support and students' self‐efficacy mediating the influence of teacher autonomy support on students' online SRL, it is important to improve parental autonomy support and students' self‐efficacy. • In order to improve students' online SRL ability, teachers need focus on parental autonomy support, and parental autonomy support focus on improving students' self‐efficacy.

        "Scotland, traditionally, has high levels of confidence in teachers. Fairness and justice are key concepts in policy and practice in Scottish education. For more than 100 years, the high‐stakes assessment system in Scotland, with the Scottish Higher qualification at its heart, has been crucial to that sense of opportunity and justice. However, in 2019–2020, public confidence in high‐stakes assessment in Scotland, as in other United Kingdom countries, was dented. In Scotland, the Covid‐19 pandemic meant that schools were closed, teachers provided online learning opportunities for pupils working at home and, for the first time in 130 years, it was not possible to run national examinations. To ensure that learners were not further disadvantaged, alternative approaches to gathering evidence for qualifications were instigated. However, these results were challenged as socially unjust and the results that had been nationally moderated were replaced by results based on locally moderated teachers' professional judgement. As Scotland looks to qualifications beyond Covid‐19, trust must be re‐built. This article reports on a participative research project that sought to understand public perceptions of standards and fairness across a range of key communities following this experience. Drawing on both qualitative and quantitative data, we analyse factors which affected trust in National Qualifications under the pandemic. The evidence suggests that when considering what matters for qualifications to be trusted, technocratic solutions are likely to be rejected by stakeholders. Understanding and responding to what led to the mistrust of qualifications in Scotland will be crucial to inform its future qualifications system. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "While studies on online learning have been extensive, it remains unclear, however, how educators engage themselves in the sudden shift to online/remote learning or distance education because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, there is a lacuna in the literature concerning English language teachers' perceptions of the shift from the classroom to online teaching. To date, in the Philippines, no single study exists, which has examined the same or related focus. Thus, through a survey and focus group discussions among 38 Filipino university teachers of English, this study explores how English language teachers view the problems, advantages and disadvantages, and points for improvement in flexible learning (FL) amidst the pandemic. Findings indicated that most of the problems were minor. However, the most crucial concerns include comprehension of learning content, student engagement, and internet connectivity, which were likewise claimed by the participants as disadvantages of FL. The analysis also revealed two benefits: convenience, and enhancement of teaching and learning. Further, the participants emphasized the following suggestions to improve FL: planning, implementation, and monitoring of school administration; provision of adequate internet and technological resources; and capacity-building and trainings.

        "This research is designed to find out whether joining an online community combined with contract learning can enhance the learning motivation of students, promote their self-regulated learning, and improve their academic achievements. In this regard, quasi-experiment research was conducted at primary level students in which the experimental group has joined a Contract Learning Online Community (CLOC), whereas the control group was taught by normal teaching method. To get in-depth knowledge about participants' attitudes toward the CLOC, the researcher interviewed the students of the experimental group. The results indicate that the learning motivation and achievement of students in the experimental group are higher than those of students in the control group. Moreover, applying contract learning to an online learning community promotes the students' self-regulated learning and enables them to benefit from English learning in primary school. The outcome of this study shows a rosy picture for the education stakeholders to make English language learning more effective and to encourage students for the determination of self-regulated learning.

        "In this study, primary school pupils have been surveyed using the methodology of drama pedagogy, focusing on two research questions: what the risks of online activities are and how children cope with these, and what the experiences of children with distance learning were. This study investigated both areas jointly from the pupils' perspective. Three anonymous online focus groups were conducted with 16 Hungarian pupils (4 boys and 12 girls; age range: 11-15 years) in July 2020, who joined to the research on a voluntary basis and have been recruited from three rural counties with different socioeconomic backgrounds. Respondents unequivocally recounted that during the lockdown, they had spent a significant part of their time in front of a screen, mostly without adult supervision. Whilst most only experienced different forms of teasing, some cyberbullying instances bordered on criminal cases and required the involvement of parents. High exposure to such risks was experienced during the months when online learning mainly consisted of receiving assignments to work on, and most teachers were almost unavailable. Future research could compare the experiences of pupils and teachers, creating an online safe space for them where they could respond to each other's perceptions, interpretations and opinions anonymously.

        "School closures due to the COVID‐19 pandemic uncovered the overriding need to create engaging online learning environments to facilitate students' learning. This paper focuses on the online evaluation of Own‐Voice Intensive Phonics (OVIP) approach, a computer‐assisted instruction programme used during the COVID restrictions to help 15 pupils aged 7–12 with reading difficulties improve their reading. Analysis of Single Word Reading pre‐and‐post‐test revealed a 3.2‐year mean word reading age gain over a 19‐ to 22‐week period. Questionnaire data from pupils and parents and the end of OVIP session and parent‐reported data at a one‐year follow‐up demonstrated an overall increase in pupil reading skills and self‐confidence that transferred into wider confidence and engagement for some pupils. Findings indicate that OVIP might be an effective teacher‐mediated programme in supporting pupils with reading difficulties to enhance their reading skills through online tutoring. Further research is necessary to compare teacher‐mediated own voice approaches to unmediated programmes, using a larger sample. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "It is well established that literacy as a social practice is fundamental to supporting and facilitating student learning across the years of schooling, and research has shown the importance of all teachers understanding the literacies of their learning areas and being able to mobilise effective literacy practices to support student learning outcomes. During the first two years of the Covid-19 pandemic teachers across the globe were forced to (re)negotiate the reading, writing and speaking demands of learning and teaching in uncharted, digitally mediated environments. In this paper, we report on findings from a research project undertaken at a large secondary school in Victoria, Australia which investigated the ways in which teachers' priorities during online learning impacted on their approaches to and enactment of disciplinary literacy. We identify two priorities that emerge from interviews with teachers during and after the COVID lockdown: (1) to support the development of student disciplinary and content knowledge and (2) to engage in pedagogies that consider cyber-safety and student-wellbeing. We explore these priorities in the context of teachers' literacy knowledge and practices and students' literacy engagement and learning, and consider the implications of this analysis for issues of equity and quality in fully online digital contexts.

        "In the program-driven information age, programming education is concerned by the global education system, which makes the cultivation of children's programming ability become the focus of attention. However, there is no clear definition of programming ability and teaching model. Through the snowball method, 86 studies from 1980 to 2020 were reviewed. The results showed that K-12 programming ability is defined as a stable personality and psychological characteristic that consisted of metacognition, cognition, operation and communication, including 17 sub-abilities. On this basis, the K-12 programming ability teaching model was constructed by integrating the educational levels, teaching methods, teaching tools, assessment approach in each research. Among them, the programming education of K-12 was committed to cultivate students' cognitive and operational ability. Additionally, There are most researches on teaching intervention for primary school students. Block-based tools are most widely used in research, and project-based learning and problem-based learning are common teaching methods in current programming teaching, while game-based learning, blended learning and cooperative learning have also become the trend in programming teaching. In the meanwhile, programming testing, observation and interview are widely used in programming teaching. This model provides more scientific and standardized reference and guidance for researchers and teachers, and contribute to significant implication for policy, theory and practice of K-12 programming education.

        "Background: In fact, most schools around the world are not well equipped to have discussions and keep current on the expansion of artificial intelligence (AI) in many aspects of society and economy. They either ignore this conversation, or simply criticize technology, but these resistances are not stopping wide spread of various types of AI projects in schools, mainly driven by corporations, and fueled by incentives that might not match well with long term educational objectives of student success, diversity, equity, and inclusivity. Objectives: The overall purpose is to address the rising gap between the ultrafast development of AI and the meticulous technological application of education, and to suggest the important bridge of building technological leadership in teacher preparation to get ready for the grow of AI in education. Methods: The contextual review examines the field of AI development in education through three lenses: conceptual context, practice context, and research context. Results and Conclusions: The paper provides educators and policy makers an overall background of the phenomenon of AI in education. The study has revealed there is an urgent need for research and development in teacher preparation as well as in the philosophy of technology in education to bridge the gap between AI and education. Lay Description: The initiative addresses the rising gap between the ultrafast development of artificial intelligence and the meticulous technological application of education.To get ready for AIED, the project advises educators, technologists, and policy makers to focus on educational leadership, and philosophy of technology in education to overcome the ethical bottleneck hindering AI progress at the philosophical level.The study highlights the critical need for more research on learning and classroom management, teacher preparation programs, school administration, educational philosophy, and educational policy.

        "A three-phase exploratory sequential mixed-method study was conducted to propose and test a model showing the interrelationships among the contextual factors influencing the science teachers' Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK). Though developing teachers' TPACK is critical for technology integration in education, the contextual factors influencing TPACK were mostly neglected and this study aimed to fill this gap in the literature. The first phase of the study was aimed to determine the contextual factors by interviewing science teachers and educational technology experts. The findings revealed nine common factors involving student influence, teachers' beliefs and attitudes, technological infrastructure, administrative support, technical support, colleague interaction, lack of time, professional development, educational technology experience. In the second phase, a path model was hypothesized based on qualitative study results and related literature. In the third phase, a valid and reliable scale, named Contextual Factors Scale was developed to measure these contextual factors. Then, a questionnaire involving this scale and TPACK was administrated to 348 science teachers. Showing complex interrelationships among contextual factors, the model explained 45% of the variance in science teachers' TPACK, with particular importance placed on professional development, teachers' beliefs and attitudes, administrative support, and student influence. Looking from a holistic perspective, this study provided a valuable model for guiding decision-makers, researchers, and practitioners about how to improve teachers' TPACK and technology integration in the schools. Considering the complex interrelationships in the model, some simultaneous strategies dealing with each factor should be applied to improve teachers' TPACK and technology-related practices in the schools.

        "Educational technology is a discipline that has a lot of roles to play in the global education system yet, its services had been neglected over the years in Nigeria. The new global reality that was occasioned by the upsurge of COVID-19 has made educational technology a very consequential discipline with conspicuous roles to play in the face of such a global pandemic. COVID-19 has halted many human activities across the globe. Its effect in the education system has resulted to re-adjustment in the school calendar, prolonged graduation dates, and reduced research output. To combat this, many education systems now adopt the services of educational technology thereby changing the old norm. But for this new norm to be sustainable, this paper argues that the education system must show a pragmatic attitude towards the adoption of such innovation rather than a conservative attitude. Therefore, using the diffusion theory of innovation, this paper argues that necessity called for compulsory adoption of innovation in the Nigerian education system. This new opportunity, however, looks bleak as many educational practitioners lack the required skills and attitude to adopt the innovation. It, therefore, concludes that educational practitioners need in-service training to be part of these changes. The government is suggested to apply a systematic approach in procuring and installing ICT facilities that will enhance the diffusion of this innovation into the school system.

        "Learning motivation is crucial to online learning success, especially for K-12 students. Although previous research has proved that there are many factors influencing online learning motivation, few studies have systematically investigated this phenomenon from the integrated perspectives of community of inquiry and technology acceptance, two theoretical frameworks that are commonly used to explain experiences of and attitude towards online learning. This study investigates the effects of K-12 students' perceived presence and technology acceptance on their online learning motivation. A total of 13,610 valid questionnaires were collected from K-12 students from Wuhan and adjacent areas in central China participated in the survey. The findings reveal that: (1) perceived usefulness, self-efficacy, social presence, and perceived ease of use have a larger positive effect on online learning motivation, while cognitive presence has a small positive effect on online learning motivation; (2) teaching presence positively influences online learning motivation through social or cognitive presence; (3) factors, such as school location, previous online learning experience, family social-economic status, and prior academic achievements, may influence technology acceptance. The implications for designing, developing, and managing K-12 online education are discussed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

We use a quantitative methodological approach with a quasi-experimental design and surveys as assessment tools. All 62 participants were studying Musical Education and its Didactics in their Bachelor's Degree in Primary Education at a private Spanish university and had finished their internship period. Application of the gamification strategy proved effective for dynamic teaching-learning. Findings show how the appropriate teacher training in didactic use of information and communication technologies (ICT) can achieve positive educational results when used correctly. ICT teaching practices for music education should be implemented with an adequate didactic approach for best results. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "The advancement of technologies has promoted the increasing popularity and integration of mobile technologies in science education in the past decade. These trends have led to an increased interest among scholars to understand the effects of mobile technologies in science education and whether those effects differ depending on how mobile technologies are used in learning and teaching (eg, student‐led, teacher‐led, collaborative). In this study, we performed a meta‐analysis of 34 studies that directly examined the effects of users' pedagogical role on K‐16 students' achievement in science when engaging in mobile learning (ML). The analysis of the 34 studies yielded an overall significant main effect of ML on K‐16 science learning outcomes. We applied the mixed‐effects model with moderator variables and found that users' pedagogical role significantly moderated the ML effects as a whole. Collaborative and student‐led uses had a statistically significant impact on student science learning, whereas teacher‐led use did not. Findings from this meta‐analysis are consistent with prior research, providing synthesized research‐based evidence of the effects of ML on science learning that holds implications for both mobile curriculum design and mobile technology use. Practitioner notesWhat is already known about this topicMobile technology has been increasingly adopted in science learning with great potential to support learning and teaching.Prior meta‐analysis has suggested multiple moderators in measuring the mobile learning effect.Prior empirical studies examined the effect of mobile users' pedagogical role in the specific subject domains (eg, physics) and grade levels (eg, high school).What this paper addsThis meta‐analysis is among the first to examine the moderator effect of mobile users' pedagogical roles on ML in K‐16 science education.This study found that mobile technology use is associated with significant science learning outcomes across 34 studies.This study found that the effect of mobile learning was moderated by mobile users' pedagogical roles (ie, who initiated the use). Collaborative use between teachers and students tends to be the most effective. Teacher‐led use tends to be the least effective.Implications for practiceThis study suggests that we should consider who leads the use of mobile technology when integrating mobile learning in science education.In particular, educators should encourage collaborative and student‐led mobile use for learning and instruction.

        "Background: People with language disorders (including developmental language disorder—DLD) often struggle to learn new words and, for young adults, this could affect their success in future work. Therefore, it is crucial to support their learning of career‐specific vocabulary. However, little published evidence exists regarding the effectiveness of speech and language intervention for older adolescents and young adults with (developmental) language disorder (D)LD within a post‐16 provision. Aims: To investigate whether for students with (D)LD in a post‐16 environment, the addition of direct individual intervention from a speech and language therapist (SLT) teaching course‐specific vocabulary leads to more progress than just in‐course teaching on bespoke vocabulary measures. Methods & Procedures: A total of 28 college‐aged students (11 female and 17 male) with (D)LD (aged 16.0–19.9) participated in a within‐participant study comparing progress with explicit vocabulary intervention plus in‐course teaching versus in‐course teaching alone. The participants were assessed at four time points (3 months pre‐intervention, immediately pre‐ and post‐intervention, 3.5 months after intervention) using bespoke vocabulary assessments with an equal number of nouns, verbs and adjectives. All participants received one‐to‐one vocabulary intervention from their usual SLT for 30 min per week for 9 weeks. The intervention had four main components: (1) to identify intervention focus, (2) to recap previously taught terms (using an online flashcard program), (3) to explicitly teach new words using word maps to help with: creating definition and pictorial representation, identification of word class and investigation of phonological and morphological properties, and (4) to add new words, with their definition and pictorial representation to online flashcard program. Outcomes & Results: The results showed a stable baseline, then during the intervention term significant progress on words targeted only in lessons and significantly greater progress on words targeted both in lessons and SLT sessions. Progress was maintained for 14 weeks. Individuals with initially lower scores showed smaller intervention effects. In general, performance was higher on verbs and on the definition recognition task and lower on the production tasks, but all tasks improved with intervention. Conclusions & Implications: Direct one‐to‐one vocabulary intervention with an SLT can lead to significant gains in knowledge of course‐specific terminology for college‐aged students with (D)LD. The effectiveness of speech and language therapy services for this age group in a wider range of areas of language and social communication should also be investigated. What this paper adds: What is already known on this subject: Very few services exist for young adults with DLD, despite their persisting language difficulties and the detrimental impact of these on their academic attainment and employment prospects. Most careers involve specific vocabulary which is crucial to executing a role successfully and these need to be learned by those looking to move into these careers. However, children, adolescents and adults with DLD struggle to learn new words and may need help in this area. What this study adds to existing knowledge: The young adults with (D)LD received 9 weeks of intervention targeting individualized course‐specific vocabulary (nouns, verbs and adjectives), using word maps to focus on word forms, definitions, morphologically related words and syntactic information such as word class and how to use the word in a sentence. An online learning tool provided regular spaced retrieval practice of previously taught words and their definitions. The participants showed significant progress with learning course‐specific vocabulary from attending lessons. However, they made significantly greater progress on those words which were also targeted in individual SLT sessions, regardless of word class. Progress was maintained over 14 weeks. What are the potential or actual clinical implications of this work?: Direct one‐to‐one vocabulary intervention with an SLT can lead to significantly greater gains in the acquisition of targeted course‐specific terminology for young adults with (D)LD than the vocabulary teaching available in lessons. Individual intervention delivered by SLTs should therefore be offered to this age group of students with (D)LD to maximize their ability to access the academic curriculum and their future careers. Indeed, the broader role of SLTs in helping these young adults to access the world of work and independent living should be further investigated and supported. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "This research investigated 1,552 university students to explore the correlation between their learning effectiveness of artificial intelligence (AI) technology application and its influencing factors. The aim is to provide a reference for school planning and application of AI in information and communications technology (ICT) teaching. The results show that ICT self-efficacy (ICT-SE) has a significant direct effect, and human-computer interaction experience (HCIE) has a significant indirect effect on lLearning effectiveness of AI-based technology applications (LE-AITA). The impact model of university student ICT-SE and HCIE on LE-AITA exhibits a good fit. The recommendation is that Taiwan education improve the AI learning environment, provide a suitable platform for the use and development of educational technology, and create a seamless teaching and learning experience. We discuss influencing factors and provide suggestions for the development of AI education. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "As the field of K‐12 data science education continues to take form, humanistic approaches to teaching and learning about data are needed. Data feminism is an approach that draws on feminist scholarship and action to humanize data and contend with the relationships between data and power. In this review paper, we draw on principles from data feminism to review 42 different educational research and design approaches that engage youth with data, many of which are educational technology intensive and bear on future data‐intensive educational technology research and design projects. We describe how the projects engage students with examining power, challenging power, elevating emotion and lived experience, rethinking binaries and hierarchies, embracing pluralism, considering context, and making labour visible. In doing so, we articulate ways that current data education initiatives involve youth in thinking about issues of justice and inclusion. These projects may offer examples of varying complexity for future work to contend with and, ideally, extend in order to further realize data feminism in K‐12 data science education. Practitioner notesWhat is already known about this topic Data feminism is an emergent framework for changing data practices and discourse in service of equity and justice.Data science education is rapidly growing as a topic of interest in the educational technology research and design communities.Many educational technology and design projects have been launched and shared in publications that preceded the widespread distribution of the data feminism framework.What this paper adds Data feminism is partially re‐articulated in terms familiar to educational technology research communities.Prior and recent projects are organized with respect to how they illustrate potential connections to core data feminism principles.This paper identifies specific strategies that recent projects have used that have potential for realizing data feminism principles.Implications for practice and/or policy Educational technologists can use the re‐articulated principles of data feminism for education to inform their future design work.Tractable steps to achieve data justice that are attainable within existing educational systems can be pursued.Communities can and should bring together multiple ways of knowing to support new educational practices and futures with data.

        "Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) has gained increasing popularity in human society, and it is important to educate people about this emerging technology. Many countries have adopted school curricula to incorporate AI into their classrooms. However, developing tools for discovering AI concepts remains challenging. There are few studies on AI education tools, particularly in Thailand. Objectives: This study designs AIThaiGen, a web‐based learning platform for junior high school students that introduces AI concepts. It can communicate with remote hardware stations, allowing students to test their AI models in real‐world scenarios. Methods: A total of 106 students in 7th and 8th grade in Thailand participated, and a single‐group pre‐test‐post‐test research design was employed in this study. Pre‐post‐tests on the basic concepts of AI and the students' attitude questionnaire on AIThaiGen were used to collect and analyse data. Results and Conclusions: The results show that there is a significant improvement (p < 0.001) in the pre‐post‐tests on the basic concepts of AI, and the overall result of the students' attitude questionnaire on AIThaiGen is X¯=3.88, indicating positive outlooks. Furthermore, notable student projects are showcased, highlighting their ability to initiate new ideas for solving real problems after studying with AIThaiGen. Lay Description: What is already known about this topic: Several AI learning platforms with varying target audiences and presentations have been proposed in recent years.Visual programming languages are more suited to novice learners of AI. What this paper adds: This paper introduces an AIThaiGen platform that allows students to learn basic AI without prior programming knowledge.The AIThaiGen platform enables virtual and real hardware control for students by using their trained AI models.This study investigated students' attitudes towards learning AI programming with AIThaiGen and their comprehension of fundamental AI concepts. Implications for practice and/or policy: This study provides design ideas for creating an AI learning platform with a low entry barrier.This study highlights issues that one may encounter when using a web‐based AI learning tool in actual classrooms and suggests potential solutions.

        "This article aims to explore the challenges associated with providing digital resources to stakeholders and identifying the obstacles and barriers to the successful design and exploitation of digital resources in the classroom and a wider learning environment. As a direct consequence of Covid-19 and the physical closure of schools we can now identify three specific content-producing cultures emerging within the educational community (Marcus-Quinn, A., T. Hourigan, and S. McCoy. 2019a. \"'The Digital Learning Movement: How Should Schools Respond?'.\" Economic and Social Review 50 (4): 767–783). On the top tier we can see the independently developed resources by private educational companies that have been designed with accessibility hardwired into the resources. Such accessibility caters to the widest range of user needs. The second tier provides digital materials that have been produced by teachers in schools that have a 'tech-driven' agenda; such schools do not make it mandatory for teachers or students to use privately produced books. The third tier comprises teachers, outside of a formal community of practice, who use privately produced resources but modify them to suit their student needs better. There has been a rapid migration to digital learning as a direct response to the challenges posed by Covid-19 in schools (Mohan, G., S. McCoy, E. Carroll, G. Mihut, S. Lyons, and C. Mac Domhnaill. 2020. \"Learning for all? Second-level education in Ireland during COVID-19.\" ESRI Survey and Statistical Report Series 92 June 2020.). As schools have scrambled to adapt to this ever-changing environment, digital inclusion has never been more critical as school communities now navigate these new learning experiences (Hall, Byrne et al. 2021; Marcus-Quinn, A., and T. Hourigan. 2021. Handbook for Online Learning Contexts: Digital, Mobile and Open: Policy and Practice. Cham: Springer.; Murphy, C., A. Marcus-Quinn, and T. Hourigan. 2021a. \"Exploring the Ripple Effect of 'Always On'Digital Work Culture in Secondary Education Settings.\" In Handbook for Online Learning Contexts: Digital, Mobile and Open, edited by A. Marcus-Quinn and T. Hourigan, 339–353. Cham: Springer, Murphy, C., A. Marcus-Quinn, and T. Hourigan. 2021b. \"Technostress in Secondary Education Settings.\" Coping with COVID: Advancing Education. The Naace Journal 89: 17–23). To comply with European legislation passed in 2019, public sector organisations and private companies and organisations need to check the accessibility of their websites, mobile apps, and media content (Oncins, E., and P. Orero. 2021. \"Let's put Standardisation in Practice: Accessibility Services and Interaction.\" Hikma 20 (1): 71–90. https://www.pdsttechnologyineducation.ie/en/Planning/Digital-Learning-Framework-and-Planning-Resources-Post-Primary/Digital-Learning-Framework-for-Post-Primary-Schools.pdf). The educational publishing sector should also adhere to these common accessibility standards ensuring that digital content conforms to digital equity, diversity, and inclusion principles (Mihut, G., S. McCoy, and B. Maître. 2021. \"A Capability Approach to Understanding Academic and Socio-emotional Outcomes of Students with Special Educational Needs in Ireland.\" Oxford Review of Education.). During the Covid-19 pandemic it became clear that there is an appetite for high-quality open-access digital teaching and learning materials (Eivers, E., J. Worth, and A. Ghosh. 2020. Home Learning During COVID-19: Findings from the Understanding Society Longitudinal Study. Slough: National Foundation for Educational Research.). To improve the consistency and reusability of such resources the education community would benefit from easy access to shared quality templates that are professionally designed and usability tested. Such an initiative is unlikely to happen without buy-in from publishers in conjunction with the Department of Education. Such collaboration was behind the successful establishment of Scoilnet: Ireland's national repository for shared digital teaching and learning materials. During the pandemic Scoilnet compiled a list to highlight the Open-access resources available to stakeholders and requested that teachers make recommendations and upload such resources to the Scoilnet portal. It is clear that such resources need to be designed and developed, and this requires professional time and resources. We cannot expect this to happen without cost. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "Background: Since the outbreak of COVID‐19, online courses have been extensively used from K‐12 to higher education. Online learning engagement, an important factor in online learning success, is currently at a low level in high school. Meanwhile, the research on the factors that influence high school students' online learning engagement is still limited. Objectives: Based on the theories of regulatory focus and value control, this study developed a multi‐mediation model to investigate whether self‐efficacy and academic emotions can mediate the relationship between regulatory focus and online learning engagement. Methods: A total of 926 high school student (52.16% female, mean age = 16.47 years) were recruited to participate in this study and completed self‐report measures of regulatory focus, online learning engagement, online learning self‐efficacy and academic emotions. And we used SPSS macro PROCESS developed by Hayes to examine the mediating role of online learning self‐efficacy and academic emotions. Results and Conclusions: The results indicated that promotion focus had a stable positive effect on online learning engagement of high school students, whereas prevention focus had a significant negative effect on the same. Self‐efficacy and positive emotions had a significant positive mediating effect between promotion focus and online learning engagement. Moreover, positive emotions had a significant positive mediating effect between the prevention focus and online learning engagement, while negative emotions had a significant negative mediating effect between them. Lay Description: What is already known about this topic: Regulatory focus is a self‐regulatory motivational orientation that has a significant impact on online learning for university students.Self‐efficacy and academic emotions are among the main factors that influence online learning engagement.Online learning has spread due to the COVID‐19 pandemic. Lack of understanding of online learning engagement for high school students. Lack of experience of teachers in teaching online. What this paper adds: Promotion focus had a steady significant positive effect on high school students' online learning engagement, while prevention focus had a significant negative effect on high school students' online learning engagement.Self‐efficacy and positive emotion had a significant positive mediating effect between promotion focus and online learning engagement.Positive emotion had a significant positive mediating effect between prevention focus and online learning engagement, while negative emotions had a significant negative mediating effect between them. Implications for practice and/or policy: These findings provide suggestions for instructional strategies for the online classroom. (1) It is important for online teachers to design appropriate learning contexts to initiate a promotion focus for learners in order to increase online learning engagement. For example, by designing online learning contextual elements such as learning activities, learning atmosphere, social interactions, media resources, and contexts, online learners' tendency to promotion focus is activated and learners' level of engagement in online learning is increased. (2) Online teachers can promote learning engagement by initiating a promotion focus, or they can improve students' accountability by initiating their prevention focus, as appropriate. (3) To ensure a certain level of engagement in online learning, teachers should use teaching and learning assessment methods that are predominantly promotion‐focused and supplemented by prevention‐focused methods to accommodate students' different motivational orientations.

        "The rapid development of information and communication technologies (ICT), and the unexpected transition to online teaching due to COVID-19 necessitates that teachers should have the knowledge, competent skills and strategies to integrate digital tools and platforms effectively. Literature suggests however that many teachers do not feel confident enough or lack perceived capability in teaching using advanced technologies in classrooms, and do not have positive self-efficacy beliefs towards their online teaching. Hence, the purpose of this mixed-method study is to investigate teachers' self-efficacy (TSE) in online learning environments amid COVID-19. A total of 150 K-12 teachers from six Arab countries were invited to participate in the study. Quantitative and qualitative data revealed that perceived self-efficacy of online teaching was high. Two main factors, receiving support to design online instruction and receiving professional development in online teaching, significantly predict participants' sense of self-efficacy. Teachers who have previous experience in online teaching scored higher on their self-efficacy than teachers with limited or no experience. Student engagement had the weakest correlation between the four scales with the overall self-efficacy. Parental involvement was discovered through the qualitative analysis to be an emerging factor that could enhance teachers' self-efficacy. Recommendations and limitations are further discussed.

        "Once the COVID-19 crisis is over, will everything\" return to normal\" or will we instead witness an ongoing boom in online learning? A time of crisis is an opportunity for all education systems to look to the future; there is enormous potential for digital technology in mathematics education, regardless of the impact of COVID-19. In this paper, the researcher focuses on answering two research questions: (1) Is COVID-19 the gateway for digital learning in mathematics education? (2) What type of digital technology is being used in mathematics education during the COVID-19 pandemic? The study also provided a discussion on the implications that such digital technologies could have on research into the field of mathematics education and practice in addition to suggestions for future research directions on this topic. Interviews were chosen as techniques for the purpose of this research, which were undertaken with hundred and twenty mathematics teachers from different secondary schools in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The researcher found that 98% of participants believed that COVID-19 is the gateway for digital learning in mathematics education. In addition, 97% claimed that the use of online education by schools had expanded greatly following the coronavirus outbreak. This has resulted in various forms of software being used to facilitate communicate between teachers and students included mobile technologies, touchscreens and pen tablets, digital library and designing learning objects in mathematics education, Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) in mathematics, and computer algebra systems (CAS) such as Mathematical, Maple, MuPAD, MathCAD, Derive and Maxima.

        "The application of mathematical skills is essential to our daily routine and is foundational for numerous disciplines. Among various computer-supported learning methods, Digital Game-Based Learning (DGBL) has been perceived as a promising method in teaching mathematics, promoting students' interest, and motivation. Therefore, the aim of this systematic literature review is to provide a detailed synthesis of literature regarding the effectiveness of DGBL applications in K-12 mathematics education and extend the findings of previous reviews. This study reviewed a total of 43 articles published in the Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI) of Web of Science, and other top-ranked educational technology journals between 2008 and 2019. The findings were then evaluated according to the multi-dimensional framework and classified into three main categories: knowledge acquisition, perceptual and cognitive skills, and affective, motivational, and behavioral change. This revealed that most of the reviewed studies have reported positive gains in all categories, with the traditional method of teaching being the most popular comparison approach. Numerous scholars also demonstrated a particular interest in the subject of arithmetic operations. The study also found that a considerable number of DGBL applications were constructed based on a specific design feature or learning theory. Furthermore, this study highlighted a number of research gaps in this domain according to which more research is required to understand how different dynamics (e.g., collaborative/cooperative, competitive) influence students' learning. Additionally, more studies are required to address the lack of research on twenty-first-century skills such as creativity and critical thinking. The findings of this review could benefit researchers and educators who are interested in using educational computer games to teach mathematics. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "Many countries around the world have now introduced Digital Technology concepts and pedagogical practices to their primary school curricula to ensure students develop the understanding, competences and values that will enable them to contribute to and benefit from their future labour market and society. This study aimed to explore teachers' experiences with these curricula in order to understand how teachers can be supported to raise their implementation efforts. An analysis of twenty-three studies across eleven countries was undertaken and found there was a lack of consensus of an appropriate age and approach to introducing Digital Technology concepts within primary schools. Teachers' Digital Technology self-efficacy, Digital Technology self-esteem/ Digital Technology confidence was seen to greatly influence their implementation, and many challenges to implementation were discussed. Professional Learning and Development was raised as a solution to boost teachers' confidence and overcome common implementation barriers. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "This article reports on how those working in post-secondary education and training in Singapore perceive the professional effects of a transition to online learning, teaching and assessment (LTA) as a consequence of the COVID-19 global pandemic. It draws on a survey sample of n = 1553 educators and trainers working in Singapore and their perspectives on how a migration to online LTA is producing long-term, if not permanent, changes to the organisation and delivery of post-secondary education and training. It reveals a largely positive view of digital resettlement of education and training in Singapore as a consequence of COVID-19. Yet despite the articulation by respondents of 'paradigm change' and 'education without limits', we find that an embrace of digitalisation is mobilised (and manipulated) not so much by pedagogical concerns but by economic ambitions and a utilitarian logic common to the neoliberal incantations of a global education policy community.

        "This paper reinvents Freire's concepts of 'banking education' and 'literacy' within the context of the exponential growth of digital instruction in the 21st century. We argue that digital learning (i.e. online or technology enhanced) undoubtedly increases access to education globally, but also can intensify some of the worst problems described in Freire's banking model. Accordingly, we draw from postdigital theory to scrutinize the specific structures and functions of common digital Learning Management Systems (LMSs) used by schools (i.e. Blackboard and Google Classroom) to reveal a type of learning that further exacerbates the teacher-student dichotomy without liberating either party in a Freirean sense. We then use a Foucauldian lens to bring an awareness to how the accelerated use of these systems at scale, in part caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, can further entrench a data-driven, dehumanized educational experience which increases corporate profitability perhaps over the needs of students. Finally, we use these insights to modernize Freire's concept of 'literacy' by building on Critical Medial Literacy (CML) in order to help educators address LMSs, (mis)information facilitated by digital content, and schooling in a (post)pandemic and postdigital world.

        "The teaching of financial literacy through game-based approaches is legitimized by the ability of game-based learning (GBL) to simulate financial decisions that young people have not yet encountered in their lives due to limited legal capacity and economic dependence on the parental home. Although results on the general effectiveness of games are already available, the question about for which students GBL is effective in teaching financial literacy has not yet been researched in depth. Based on pedagogical interest theory, a pre–post design (n = 50; 30 female students) was conducted to investigate the effects of high school students' individual prerequisites on their game experience and their development of situational interest by playing an analog game and debriefing. The main findings indicate that a higher level of prior motivation for this topic has a positive effect on game experience and situational interest. A high level of prior knowledge and leisure activities concerning finance may have a somewhat negative effect. Such games are particularly suitable for students who are aware of the subjective significance of finance but have not previously had the opportunity to engage with this topic for different reasons.

        "Background: Digital game‐based learning (DGBL) has been shown to be an effective strategy for promoting learning motivation. However, a lack of attention has been paid to investigating the effects of individual differences on elementary students' reading motivation and in‐gaming achievements in DGBL. Objectives: This study developed an educational mobile game to facilitate learners' reading activities, and investigated how prior knowledge and gaming experience affected learners' reading motivation, gaming motivation, perceptions and in‐game achievements. Methods: A total of 53 third to fifth grade elementary school students participated in this study, and were divided into the high prior knowledge (HPK)/low prior knowledge (LPK) and the high gaming experience (HGE)/low gaming experience (LGE) groups. Results and Conclusions: The HPK learners had higher reading motivation, perceptions, gaming and social achievements than the LPK learners, whereas they had similar gaming motivation and reading achievements. In addition, the HGE learners had lower reading motivation, reading and gaming achievements than the LGE learners, whereas they had similar gaming motivation, perceptions and social achievements. Moreover, correlational results showed that similarities and differences were observed between the HPK/LPK and HGE/LGE learners. Implications: The findings of this study suggest that learners' prior knowledge and gaming experience play influential roles in reading motivation, gaming motivation, perceptions and in‐game achievements. A framework is proposed for researchers or game designers to develop personalized DGBL systems to accommodate the HPK/LPK and HGE/LGE learners' individual needs or preferences in DGBL. Lay Description: What is already known about this topic: Reading motivation is a critical factor influencing reading performance.Students have difficulties developing reading skills due to a lack of reading motivation, and therefore need additional support.DGBL has been shown to be an effective strategy for promoting learning motivation.Relevant empirical research investigating the impact of individual differences on reading in DGBL is scarce. What this paper adds: A mobile game‐based reading app was developed to facilitate elementary students' reading activities.This study provides understandings of the impact of prior knowledge and gaming experience on reading motivation, gaming motivation, perceptions and in‐game achievements in DGBL.The HPK learners had higher reading motivation, perceptions, gaming and social achievements than the LPK learners, whereas they had similar gaming motivation and reading achievements.The HGE learners had lower reading motivation, reading and gaming achievements than the LGE learners, whereas they had similar gaming motivation, perceptions and social achievements. Implications for practice and/or policy: Educators should consider adopting DGBL to facilitate students' reading activities.Prior knowledge and gaming experience play influential roles in reading motivation, gaming motivation, perceptions and in‐game achievements.Learners' prior knowledge and gaming experience should be taken into account when designing learning activities in DGBL.A personalized DGBL system should be developed to accommodate the needs and preferences of the HPK/LPK and HGE/LGE learners.

        "With the escalating growth of English language learners (ELLs) worldwide, educational technology has been identified as an important learning tool with significant potential to support second language literacy development. This review examined the effectiveness of technology-integrated literacy instruction in the classroom context for ELLs in Grades K-12. Thirty-six articles with 42 independent samples, based on a total of 4,354 participants, were included in this meta-analysis. Findings confirmed that technology-integrated instruction produced a positive, medium effect size (ES = 0.47) on literacy outcome as compared to traditional methods where no technology was involved. Moderator analyses were conducted with eight study features: grade level, learning context, study duration, intensity per week, total contact time, literacy outcome, pedagogical use, and teaching method. Learning context and literacy outcomes were found to be statistically significant to explain the variance of the effect sizes between the studies. These results advocate for the use of educational technology in literacy instruction for ELLs, regardless of literacy outcomes, pedagogical use, teaching methods, learning contexts, and grade levels. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "Background: Mastering fractions seems among the most critical mathematical skills for students to acquire in school as fraction understanding significantly predicts later mathematic achievements, but also broader academic and vocational prospects. As such, identifying longitudinal predictors of fraction understanding (e.g., mastery of numbers and operations) is highly relevant. However, almost all existing studies identifying more basic numerical skills as predictors of fraction understanding rest on data acquired in face‐to‐face testing—mostly in classrooms. Objectives: In this article, we evaluated whether results obtained in these previous studies generalized to data from the curriculum‐based online learning environment Bettermarks for mathematics used in schools in the Netherlands. Methods: We considered data from more than 5000 students who solved over 1 million mathematical problem sets on basic mathematical skills, fractions, but also algebra. Results and Conclusions: In line with previous findings, we found that fraction understanding was predicted significantly by more basic mathematical skills. Our analyses also indicated that algebra achievement was predicted significantly by fraction understanding beyond influences of more basic mathematical skills. Implications: Together, these findings generalized previous results based on face‐to‐face testing to the context of data from online learning environments and thus, indicate that data from such large‐scale online learning environments may well qualify to provide significant insights into the hierarchical development of mathematical skills. Lay Description: What is already known about this topic: Understanding fractions is one of the most difficult mathematical skill for students to learn in school.Longitudinal studies using face‐to‐face testing indicated that fraction understanding as well as achievements in algebra can robustly be predicted by prior mathematics skills. What this paper adds: We evaluated data from more than 5,000 Dutch students who performed over 1 million curriculum‐based mathematical problem sets in an online learning environment.Our analyses showed that fraction understanding as well as achievements in algebra and can be predicted by prior mathematics skills. Implications for practitioners: These results indicated that previous results from face‐to‐face testing generalize to data obtained from large‐scale online learning environments.Thus, these results open up a new avenue for research using online learning environments on the development of mathematical skills.

        "The closure of school buildings due to COVID-19 and the resulting rapid transition to online education dramatically altered the lives of educators, students and parents. While previous literature demonstrates the vital role of parents in effective online education (Hattie, 2020; Liu et al, 2010), pre-pandemic literature focuses on parents and students who have opted in to online education. As such, the outbreak of COVID-19 has presented new challenges for understanding the relationship between parents and their child/ren's online learning. Since the start of the pandemic, studies have emerged exploring parental experience adjusting to their child/ren's online remote learning (Bhamani et al, 2020; Brom et al, 2020; Dong et al, 2020; Garbe et al, 2020; Lee et al, 2021). However, less is known about the online learning experiences during COVID-19 of families with children enrolled within international schools. Accordingly, the present study draws upon insights from 44 parents of children attending international schools who took part in 22 focus groups, across three countries and in three languages. The study investigates the parental experience with online education and unpacks four themes that emerged from the data: challenges faced by parents, parental perception of their child/ren's wellbeing, impressions of the learning quality and parental suggestions for consideration by school leadership. With these findings, school leaders have a unique opportunity to leverage lessons learned and support parental growth so that families, educators and students may all contribute to the promise of a brighter educational future.

        "Digital education is intertwined with matters of global economics, geopolitics, as well as ongoing changes in what counts as knowledge, skills and learning. We have witnessed throughout the COVID-19 pandemic how technology has been embraced within education from online classes to innovative mobile learning approaches and evaluating humanoid robots in education is the next step. Driven by a need to keep pace with the evolving techno- and socio-economic requirements, schools and society are increasingly adopting artificial intelligence (AI) and robots in their daily activity. This paper presents a feasibility case study in digital health education where a humanoid robot was chosen to teach based on its form and function. With an imperative to establish a strong and sustainable learning space, the aim of this paper is to present results and learn about the future of digital health education from humanoid robots being deployed in digital health learning spaces. The paper concludes by highlighting key design challenges in unbundling educational approaches in the context of humanoid robots. It is intended that the outcomes of this paper will extend beyond the COVID-19 pandemic by contributing to the humanoid robot technology discussion that will push towards more futuristic artificial intelligence in and for education.

        "We present new evidence on the pandemic's effects on youth, for the first time focusing on perceived effects on the learning of job skills, as well as on education. The context is post-Brexit Britain. We find that 47% of young people in a representative sample perceive a loss of learning of job skills, while a sizeable minority (17%) judge that the pandemic improved matters. The perception of skill loss is worse among those encountering Covid directly, and far worse among those in school, college or university than among those in employment. Among those in education, loss of learning of job skills is higher among those experiencing only online learning, but lower for those who have had some work experience. Among those in employment, loss of learning is mitigated by training, which dropped sharply at the start of the pandemic but recovered and thereafter deviated little from its long-term trend. Neither the average amount of training, nor the perception of loss of learning, were affected by being placed on 'furlough' leave. Finally, perceptions of loss of learning of job skills were greater for women than for men, and greater in Wales and Scotland than in England and Northern Ireland. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "Background: Student engagement and concentration is critical for successful learning. Due to the COVID‐19 pandemic, there has been a dramatic increase in the use of online learning which may affect engagement and concentration, particularly for those students with specific learning difficulties. Aims: Students would show lower scores on all the measures of student experience when judging these during online learning versus learning within the classroom.This negative impact of online learning on concentration, engagement, perceived learning, and self‐worth compared to classroom education would be more significant for those with specific learning difficulties.The drop in student experience scores due to online learning would be associated with poorer mental well‐being. Sample: Four hundred seven pupils aged 11–18 years at a secondary education school in Wales. Methods: A retrospective online survey comparing pupils' normal classroom experience to learning online during the first national lockdown in the United Kingdom (March–July 2020). Results: Pupils' learning experiences (concentration, engagement, ability to learn, and self‐worth from learning) were significantly lower for online learning compared to the classroom learning. These differences were more marked in students with specific learning difficulties. Perceived ability to learn and engage during classroom and online learning were also associated with mental well‐being. Conclusions: The move to online learning appears to have affected students' ability to concentrate and engage in their schoolwork and appears to have reduced their ability to learn and get self‐worth from their work. These decreases are associated with a decrease in mental well‐being. The effects appear to be exacerbated in some students with specific learning difficulties. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "Effective leadership is recognised as the second most impactful variable influencing student achievement and promoting teaching quality (Bush 2021; Leithwood et al. 2020). The paper reports on the perceptions of educational leaders in the Western Australian public education system about: their leadership capability, support mechanisms and perceived lessons and opportunities for educational practice during COVID-19. Leading educational institutions is a demanding role requiring effective leadership skills in pre-COVID-19 pandemic times, and is an evolving, learning curve for leaders continuing to have an ongoing global impact.This paper reports on a subset of results from a larger study conducted via an online survey in 2021 after a second brief lockdown in Western Australia (WA) early in 2021 to capture leaders' voices at the peak period of applying leadership in practice. Data were gathered from a targeted cohort of leaders including School Principals, Associates/Deputy Principals, School Managers and Heads of Years. Respondents identified their top concerns as health and wellbeing, online learning, and operational factors. Leaders identified support mechanisms from their own colleagues and networks, support received from the central department of education and drawing on their own leadership skill set of personal attributes to self-manage in the crisis period.

        "Although the impact of the global COVID‐19 pandemic in terms of school closure and the sudden shift to online learning has started to be explored, little has so far been written about the impact on teachers. This paper addresses this gap by drawing on the first author's autoethnographic experiences of working in the growing body of 'non‐traditional' international schooling in Shanghai, China, during the first wave of the pandemic in early 2020. These experiences are complemented by insights from other teachers from the author's school site, leading to a hybrid (auto)ethnographic perspective. By utilising and developing the emergent concept of 'precarious privilege', we can see that whilst the pandemic has restricted teachers' movements and agency in a physical sense through lockdowns and travel restrictions, this immobility also fosters new symbolic and physical spaces, which in turn give rise to new forms of privilege. The privilege in this context is not financial, as is often the case, but rather existential (reclaiming a more authentic self) and spatial (the school offers teachers security) in nature. This fresh, nuanced approach to discussing precarity is timely and necessary. Given the novelty of the situation we now find ourselves in, new positionings are required to orient the individual and the researcher to a post‐pandemic world. This paper offers one such positioning in the form of autoethnography for (re)imagining precarity and privilege in international schooling within the context of an emerging new world.

        "Sense-making is the process by which people give meaning to their collective experiences. Sense is viewed as knowledge, and the environment in which the sense is made is interconnected with communication effectiveness. Considering the critical role of sense-making in the learning process, scholars have emphasised the significance of providing interactive learning environments for students' effective learning. By employing a modified version of Dervin's sense-making theory, this qualitative case study explores the nature of students' sense-making processes in a peer self-founded online learning group without teacher involvement. The study analysed online Chat logs generated by 30 English language learning students from a secondary school in China. The Chat logs were students' discussions on a module of English writing: \"Read and then write\". The researchers made meaning of the students experiences through their dialogue and interaction, which revealed the essence of a sense-making process: gap facing, gapdefining, gap bridging and gap bridged. The observations were followed with students' interviews held to identify the factors contributing to an interactive learning environment for effective sense-making. The study found that the affordances of an interactive environment impact the communication outcomes through the interactional achievement in the sense-making process. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "Introduction: During the COVID‐19 lockdown in 2020, teachers had to shift their teaching and assessment to online. Formative assessment (FA) can help teachers to engage, guide and monitor students' (online) learning. However, more knowledge is needed of how teachers could use the full FA process online. Methods: In this study data from 50 secondary school teachers, who taught different grade levels and subjects and joined a FA learning network that started before and continued during the lockdown, were collected. The study investigates how they used online FA practices differently than face‐to‐face FA, what challenges and opportunities they experienced in online FA and what lessons they learned and intended to keep. This mixed methods study used data from a questionnaire, interviews and webinars that were segmented, coded and analysed. Results: Results showed that many teachers implemented new FA strategies and adopted, more often than in their face‐to‐face practice, all the five phases of the FA process in an aligned matter in online FA. Teachers indicated opportunities in stimulating student engagement and guiding and monitoring student learning more at an individual level in the online FA process, but also experienced challenges, mainly in lack of interaction online. Discussion: The sudden and necessary shift to online FA, due to the COVID‐19 lockdown, challenged teachers to more fundamentally reconsider their assessment practices and assumptions. Teachers intended to make use of these learned lessons to improve their future (blended) FA practice. Lay Description: Known about the subject matter: Online formative assessment (FA) can help teachers to engage, guide and monitor online learning.Most earlier research of online FA looked at parts of the FA process or tools.Teachers' former knowledge and skills in FA influences the online implementation.Online FA offers opportunities to promote learning, but is also challenging. What their paper adds to this: Experienced teachers were able to implement complete FA processes online.Teachers experienced that online FA could stimulate student engagement.Teachers made more time for individual help and feedback during online FA.Teachers intended to maintain these lessons learned in their future (blended) FA practice. The implications of study findings for practitioners: Combining online FA activities with face‐to‐face activities creates opportunities for future blended FA.The five phases of the FA cycle help teachers to implement FA online or in blended forms.

        "This is a case study on precision education (PE) in a school using the Taiwan adaptive learning platform (TALP), established by the Ministry of Education of Taiwan. TALP can be viewed as a form of PE because it can identify students' learning deficits, offer various learning materials, and provide feedback. There are limited studies on PE. The ways in which TALP enhances teaching and learning is meaningful for educational technologies, and to help improve TALP and applications of PE. Three fifth-grade classes in a Taiwanese elementary school were selected to participate in this study, comprising a total of 76 students and two teachers. Pre/post tests and regular tests were conducted. The quantitative data were analyzed with nonparametric statistics by using the Kruskal–Wallis Test and the Median Test, which did not show significant differences. However, based on the qualitative data, teachers confirmed PE could help them identify students' learning deficits. Further, this study suggests that TALP and PE may enhance students' learning to identify students' learning challenges and offer feedback. Future research should focus on a longitudinal methodology and additional PE application studies; furthermore, research should also collect students' observations and interviews.

        "Learning performance is an important indicator of online learning, is related to the quality of online education and the performance of students. Previous studies have found that learners' learning performance is related to learning motivation and academic emotion, but the role of non-intellectual factors such as academic emotion has received less attention in empirical research. In order to make up for this gap, this study explored the mediating effect of positive academic emotions on college students' online learning motivation and online learning performance, as well as the differences in mediating effects under different learning methods (i.e., online learning and offline learning). The data comes from 1088 college students who participate in online courses and offline courses in China. This study adopts correlation analysis and multiple mediation analysis to analyze the intermediary effect of online and offline students and multi-group comparisons. The results showed that the (1) online learning motivation is positively affecting online learning performance and positive academic emotions, and positive academic emotions are related to online learning performance. There is also a positive correlation between the dimensions of the three; (2) positive academic emotions part of the intermediary role between college students' online learning motivation and online learning performance; (3) the intermediary effect of positive academic emotions in offline learning is significantly greater than that of online learning. This study is not only conducive to understanding academic emotions, learning motives and learning performance, but also provides important enlightenment online learning performance management in promoting open curriculum construction.

        "With reference to the Technology-based Learning model for flipped classrooms, a literature review on Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI) papers published in the Web of Science (WOS) database was conducted, with the application of flipped learning in science education as the research topic. The study analyzed the existing research on author nationalities, application domains, research methods, participants, learning strategies, and research issues. Based on the analysis data, starting from 2015, there have been a large number of flipped classroom studies in science education. The studies were mainly from the United States; the application domains were mostly chemistry, physics, biology, and natural science and ecology. Over half of the studies adopted quantitative methods, and participants were mainly college students. In the before-class stage, the flipped classroom studies in science education mainly adopted instructional videos as the learning materials and used online learning systems as the medium for materials and online discussion. In the in-class stage, the major learning strategy was problem-based learning, while over half of the studies did not employ educational technology. In the after-class stage, most studies administered examinations to explore the learning outcomes. Accordingly, Potential research issues are proposed as a reference for future studies.

        "Use of educational technology has escalated in recent times. This study surveyed teachers in the business school of a Canadian university after it quickly pivoted to online delivery of all classes after the initial jolt of the COVID-19 pandemic. The purpose of the survey was to investigate the antecedents of the teachers' intention to use educational technology in the post-pandemic period. Consistent with the theory of reasoned action (TRA), attitude and subjective norm are both positively associated with respondents' behavioural intention to use educational technology within the two years following the pandemic. The subjective norm construct positively influences respondents' perceptions of the usefulness of the technology, indicating that respondents are influenced by their co-workers' opinions and the communications transmitted by the institution. Technological complexity and perceived usefulness of the technology respectively negatively and positively impact attitude, indicating that teachers perform an internal cost-benefit analysis when contemplating using educational technology. Technological complexity can also be considered an opportunity cost as it negatively impacts perceived usefulness. Lastly, facilitating conditions negatively impact technological complexity, indicating that supportive resources are important. These results should be of interest to university policymakers seeking to increase the use of educational technology. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "Background: Personalized learning (PL), conceptualized as an education innovation that tailors learning to meet diverse student needs, has drawn increased attention from different fields of study, such as education, learning sciences, and computer science. Regardless, there is a lack of a comprehensive understanding of PL instructional designs supported by technology. Objectives: This systematic literature review aimed to provide an empirical integration of PL designs and implementation across disciplines through the lens of the universal design for learning (UDL) framework. As an instructional framework that guides the design to embrace learner variability, UDL holds the potential to provide foundational considerations for instructional design components of PL. Methods: We used four databases including ERIC, OmniFile Full Text Select, Academic Search Complete, and Web of Science to search empirical studies investigating technology‐supported PL in PK‐12 school‐based settings. In total, 61 studies published between 2006 and 2020 were included in the review. We analysed PL design and implementation features and aligned these features to the UDL framework. Results and Conclusions: Our results indicated that current empirical PL design features were widely mapped onto the UDL framework. Most current PL studies investigated segmented aspects such as student attributes (e.g., interest, motivation, self‐regulation) and instructional practices (e.g., facilitating goal setting) that could contribute to PL design. Rarely did studies investigate how PL was operationalized in a system integrating various design components that consider learner characteristics, instructional support, and contextual implementation factors. Implications: The analysis of alignment between PL designs within the UDL framework can serve as a starting point for stakeholders to take a more holistic approach to designing PL experiences for all learners. Lay Description: What is already known about this topic: Personalized learning (PL) has emerged as an educational innovation that supports learning for all learners.Researchers across disciplines have investigated technology‐supported PL using different approaches.There is a lack of a comprehensive understanding of PL instructional designs supported by technology.The interdisciplinary framework of universal design for learning (UDL) lends itself well to evaluating instructional design variables across a vast number of PL studies. What this paper adds: A review of design and implementation features of PL supported by technology.An alignment of PL design and implementation features with the UDL framework. Implications for practice: Practitioners, researchers, instructional designers, educational technology developers, and other stakeholders should take a comprehensive approach to designing PL supported by technology for all learners.Educational stakeholders across disciplines should work collaboratively to explore how PL technologies, human‐driven factors for PL implementation, school‐level implementation systems effectively address varying learning needs of all students.

        "Identifying students facing difficulties and providing them with timely support is one of the educator's key responsibilities. Yet, this task is becoming increasingly challenging as the complexity of physical learning spaces grows, along with the emergence of novel educational technologies and classroom designs. There has been substantial research and development work focused on identifying student social behaviours in digital platforms (eg, the learning management system) as predictors of academic progression. However, little work has investigated such relationships in physical learning spaces. This study explores the potential of using wearable trackers for the early detection of low‐progress students based on their social and spatial (socio‐spatial) behaviours at the school. Positioning data from 98 primary school students and six teachers were automatically captured over a period of eight weeks. Fourteen socio‐spatial behavioural features were extracted and processed using a set of machine learning classifiers to model students' learning progression. Results illustrate the potential of prospectively identifying low‐progress students from these features and the importance of adapting classroom learning analytics to differences in pedagogical designs. Practitioner notesWhat is already known about this topicLearning analytics research on predicting students' academic progression is emerging in both digital and physical learning spaces.Students' social behaviours in learning activities is a key factor in predicting their academic progression.Emerging sensing technologies can provide opportunities to study students' real‐time social behaviours in physical learning spaces.What this paper addsFourteen progression‐related socio‐spatial behavioural features are extracted from students' physical (x‐y) positioning traces.Predictive learning analytics that achieved 81% accuracy in prospectively identifying low‐progress students from their real‐time socio‐spatial behaviours.Empirical evidence to support the need for classroom learning analytics to have instructional sensitivity (ie, be calibrated according to the learning design).Implications for practice and/or policySensing technologies and machine learning algorithms can be used to capture and generate valuable insights about higher‐order learning constructs (eg, performance and collaboration) from students' physical positioning traces in classrooms.Researchers and practitioners should be cautious with generalised classification algorithms and predictive learning analytics that do not account for the pedagogical differences between different subjects or learning designs.Researchers and practitioners should consider the potentially unforeseen ethical issues that can emerge in using sensing technologies and predictive learning analytics in authentic, physical classroom settings.

        "This study presents a quasi‐experimental longitudinal mixed‐methods research about the participation in leisure activities, physical activity, and games, as part of the family leisure programme (\"Lunae Magic School\") for Spanish families with children under 12 years old during COVID‐19 lockdown. The impact on parents and their perception of the psychological well‐being of their children is evaluated. The results show that leisure activities reduce the parent's anxiety levels measured with STAI scale (p =.0001) and their perception of the physical and emotional discomfort of their children, measured with PSC scale (p <.0001). It is qualitatively argued that despite the confinement situation, the gamification, the variety of activities and the fact of being able to enjoy quality time with the family have allowed the creation of spaces of fun and flow. Therefore, although the findings on the importance of family leisure were encouraging, more research is needed on the implementation of similar programmes. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "Despite many known educational benefits of digital game‐based learning, teaching with digital games is not yet a common practice in formal education. The role that digital game‐based learning might play in future school teaching can be explored by examining the behavioral intentions of pre‐service teachers as the ultimate gatekeepers. In this survey study, 402 pre‐service teachers from German‐speaking universities had participated. Multiple regression analyses were applied to examine the role of pre‐service teachers' personal characteristics in their intention to integrate digital games into two educational contexts. For both educational contexts, we identified perceived usefulness and curriculum relatedness of digital games as key factors in pre‐service teachers' intention to teach with digital games. We also found differences in explained variance and relevant personal characteristics between educational contexts. Overall, we discuss how teaching with digital games could become a common practice if particular characteristics of pre‐service teachers are already addressed in teacher education. Practitioner notesWhat is already known about this topicSeveral conceptual and empirical works have synthesized diverse educational benefits of teaching with digital games and digital game‐based learning.Teaching with digital games poses several infrastructural and technological challenges for teachers.Whether teaching with digital games becomes a common practice is related to the intention of teachers who act as gatekeepers for effective educational approaches.What this paper addsInsights into relations between intentions to teach with digital games and personal characteristics among pre‐service teachers as future gatekeepers.The intentions of pre‐service teachers to teach with digital games show particularly strong relations to a small set of personal characteristics.The relations between the intentions of pre‐service teachers and their personal characteristics may vary between educational contexts.Implications for practice and policyThe usefulness and curriculum relatedness of digital games in different educational contexts should be made clear to pre‐service teachers.Teacher education could better prepare pre‐service teachers for their future role as gatekeepers by providing key experiences and competences regarding teaching and learning with digital games.Policy makers could support teaching with digital games by advancing digital game‐based learning in teacher education and by reducing known barriers related to teaching with digital games.

        "Following the unexpected lockdown of education in March 2020 and again in February 2021, this research looks at the subsequent online learning that took place during the second lockdown at a vocational further education college located in the south of England. These online sessions used Google Meet as a forum and teachers at the college suddenly had to adapt their planned teaching to suit this new environment, Observation data was collected using an assessment tool consisting of 11 criteria with which to assess these sessions. This was followed up with teacher self-assessment using the same criteria and students surveyed for their perspective after the lockdown had finished in March. The data shows some discrepancy between what the observer 'saw' and what the teachers thought about their own TPACK levels in terms of outcomes and the student data indicates that online learning was 'unengaging' in terms of activities. The conclusion looks to the concept of digital wisdom as a means of using technology as a meaningful learning tool rather than as simply a different way to cover content in the light of the changes to curriculum delivery.

        "When struggling students seek academic help in online learning environments, it is important that they perceive the help they receive from others as effective. However, it remains unclear how phatic expressions—comments that are social rather than informative in nature—may help or hinder students who request support for coursework in online settings. This exploratory study investigates how phatic expressions influence the perceived helpfulness of online peer help-giving replies in an asynchronous college course discussion forum. The participants were 320 undergraduate students enrolled in a large introductory statistics course. We used mixed methods to examine how students rated and described the helpfulness of examples of replies to online requests for help, both with and without four types of phatic expressions: greeting/parting tokens, other-oriented comments, self-oriented comments, and neutral comments. Students perceived help-giving replies with neutral and self-oriented phatic comments as less helpful than those discussing course content alone. They described these comments as unnecessary and potentially discouraging. In contrast, students perceived help-giving replies with greetings/parting tokens and other-oriented comments as equally helpful as those discussing course content alone. They described these comments as kind and contributing to a sense of connectedness. This study is the first to identify the extent to which different types of phatic expressions contribute to or detract from the perceived helpfulness of online peer help-giving interactions. We expect this work to provide valuable insights for educators and researchers seeking to foster productive online learning experiences through effective online help-giving interactions. • Investigated the perceived helpfulness of phatic expressions in online help-giving. • Phatic expressions overall did not improve the perceived helpfulness of replies. • Greetings/farewells and other-oriented comments may foster affective engagement. • Neutral and self-oriented comments may be perceived as unnecessary or discouraging.

        "In order to understand the real situation of classroom teaching under the environment of information technology and the problems existing in the integration of information technology and curriculum in actual classroom teaching, this paper takes multimedia, interactive electronic whiteboard and Moodle platform as the research and analysis object and uses ITIAS to describe the real situation of classroom teaching. This paper makes a quantitative analysis of the classroom teaching behavior and technology using behavior of 3 teachers and 151 students in the integrated teaching of information technology and curriculum, and makes a comparative analysis with the data obtained from the questionnaire survey of the information education behavior of 213 teachers and a lot of students in 36 middle schools in southern Henan. After investigation and research, three findings have been found: firstly, the initiative of many Chinese teaching is still in the hands of teachers. Secondly, the interaction between teachers and students in classroom teaching has an important impact on teaching and learning. Thirdly, implication of information technology can effectively promote students' autonomous learning and teachers' reflection. Therefore, under the background of artificial intelligence, this paper puts forward the following teaching countermeasures: firstly, it is imperative for teachers to use information technology for effective teaching. Secondly, teachers ought to encourage students to use information technology to improve their cognitive ability and inquiry ability. Thirdly, teachers are encouraged to pay attention to the formative evaluation of the learning process and individual students. Fourthly, middle school Chinese teachers need make effective use of information technology to create an interactive teaching environment. Fifthly, teachers are supposed to focus on indirect influence to make the classroom atmosphere more democratic and harmonious in classroom teaching. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "This paper presents an implementation of Connected Spaces (CxS)—an ambient help seeking interface designed and developed for a project‐based computing classroom. We use actor network theory (ANT) to provide an underutilized posthumanist lens to understand the creation of collaborative connections in this Computational Action‐based implementation. Posthumanism offers an emerging and critical extension to sociocultural perspectives on understanding learning, by pushing us to decenter the human, and consider the active roles that human and non‐human entities play in learning environments by actively shaping each other. We analyse how students in this class adjusted their help‐seeking and collaborative habits following the introduction of CxS, a tool designed to foster (more inter‐group) collaboration. ANT proposes generalized symmetry—a principle of considering human, non‐human and more than human entities with equivalent and comparable agency, leading to describing phenomena as networks of actors in different evolving relationships with each other. Analysing collaborative interactions as fostered by CxS using an ANT approach supports design‐based research—an iterative design revision process highlighting understandings about design as well as learning—by providing a temporal and informative lens into the relationship between actors and tools within the environment. Our key findings include a framing of technologies in classrooms as bridging agentic gaps between students and becoming actors engaging in different behaviours; learners enacting new agencies through technologies (for instance a more comfortable non‐intrusive help seeker), and the need for voicing and teachers to connect help networks in CxS equipped classrooms. Practitioner notesWhat is already known about this topic Collaborative learning is a valuable skill and practice; opportunities to mentor others are critical in empowering minoritized learners, especially in STEM and computing disciplines.School norms solidify a power and expertise hierarchy between teachers and learners and fail to productively support learners in learning from each other.Additionally, lack of awareness about peers' knowledge is a common hindrance in students knowing who to ask for help and how.What this paper adds An example of a designed interface called Connected Spaces with potential to foster more inter‐student collaboration, especially outside of mandated within‐group collaboration—in the form of cross‐group help seeking and help giving.A design based research study using actor network theory highlighting the limitations of Connected Spaces in sparking notable behaviour change among students by itself but being retooled as a teacher support tool in enabling cross‐group collaborations.Presenting conceptions of collaboration through technologies as bridging agentic gaps and acting with new agencies in performing help‐seeking related actions.Provoking the idea of testing emerging technologies in classrooms along with sharing our analyses and reflections with the classroom as a key idea in computing education—surfacing the gap between designed intentions and the different kinds of extra social work needed in the on‐ground success of different technologies.Implications for practice and/or policy Designers and researchers should create and test more interfaces alongside teachers across different classrooms and contexts aimed at supporting different kinds of voluntary collaborative interactions.Curricula, standards and school practices should further center providing students with opportunities to engage as mentors and build communities of learning across disciplines to empower minoritized students.Researchers engaging in design based research should consider using more posthumanist lenses to examine educational technologies and how they affect change in learning environments.

        "This paper maps Hardt and Negri's use of Deleuze (and Guattari's) philosophical commitment to the control society as a temporal phenomena in the context of education. Education is important because it is pushed and pulled by those vectors that Hardt and Negri see as central tensions in late capitalism: localism vs globalisation, discipline vs control, codes vs axioms, metrics vs expertise and so on. In Empire, Hardt and Negri represent Empire as a form of governance that responds to the passing from disciplinary societies to societies of control. The societies of control (and Foucault's theorisation on biopower) are central to their concept of Empire defined \"as a regime of the production of identity and difference, or really of homogenization and heterogenization\" (p. 46). Empire, then, is a macropolitics that produces, or infiltrates, subjectivation as a means to affect the self within globalising and localising regimes. This paper takes up Hardt and Negri's challenge in two areas. First concerns what appears to be the collapse of the ideal of publicness within public school systems. The second provocation concerns the digital, or presumptive, economy of online and adaptive learning systems. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

This study introduced a task-based voice chatbot called \"Ellie\", newly developed by the researchers, and examined the appropriateness of its task design and performance as an English conversation partner and students' perceptions on using it in EFL class. Korean EFL learners (N = 314) aged 10–15 years performed three speaking tasks with Ellie in their school classroom. The participants took 9.63 turns per session on average using the first 1,000-word band, indicating that the chatbot highly encouraged students to engage in conversation, which rarely occurs in general EFL classes in Korea. The high task success rates (88.3%) showed the design appropriateness of both L2 tasks and operational intents in terms of users' successful understanding and completeness of the given chatbot tasks. The participants' responses to the survey not only supported the positive potential of the chatbot in EFL settings but also revealed limitations to be resolved. Future suggestions for advancing and implementing AI chatbots in EFL classrooms are discussed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "A discussion forum is a valuable tool to support student learning in online contexts. However, interactions in online discussion forums are sparse, leading to other issues such as low engagement and dropping out. Recent educational studies have examined the affordances of conversational agents (CA) powered by artificial intelligence (AI) to automatically support student participation in discussion forums. However, few studies have paid attention to the safety of CAs. This study aimed to address the safety challenges of CAs constructed with educational big data to support learning. Specifically, we proposed a safety‐aware CA model, benchmarked with two state‐of‐the‐art (SOTA) models, to support high school student learning in an online algebra learning platform. We applied automatic text analysis to evaluate the safety and socio‐emotional support levels of CA‐generated and human‐generated texts. A large dataset was used to train and evaluate the CA models, which consisted of all discussion post‐reply pairs (n = 2,097,139) by 71,918 online math learners from 2015 to 2021. Results show that while SOTA models can generate supportive texts, their safety is compromised. Meanwhile, our proposed model can effectively enhance the safety of generated texts while providing comparable support. Practitioner notesWhat is already known about this topic Online discussion forums have been plagued by a lack of interaction among students due to factors such as expectations to receive no response and perceptions of topic irrelevance which lead to low motivation to participate.AI‐based conversational agents can automatically support students' interactions in online discussion forums at a large scale, and their generated responses can be human‐like, contextually coherent and socio‐emotionally supportive.Unsafe discourse exchanges between students and conversational agents can be dangerous as identity attacks, aggravation and bullying behaviours embedded in discourses can disrupt students' knowledge inquiry and negatively influence student motivation and engagement. However, few educational studies have paid attention to the safety of conversational agents.What this paper adds This study proposes and synthesized strategies to build AI‐based conversational agents that automatically support online discussions with safe and supportive discourses.This study reveals the relationship between discourse safety and social support, suggesting supportive discourses can also be unsafe.This study enriches the literature on educational conversational agents by synthesizing a conceptual framework on discourse safety and social support, and by proposing concrete algorithmic strategies to improve the safety of conversational agents.Implications for practice and/or policy Researchers and practitioners can adopt strategies in this study such as generation control, open‐sourced models and public API services to evaluate students' discourse safety for early intervention or modify existing conversational agents to be safety‐aware.Practitioners can utilize the proposed conversational agent to automatically support students both safely and socio‐emotionally at a large scale.Practitioners should be cautious when examining social support with automatic analysis, as not all supportive texts are safe. While unsafe texts can provide emotional support, it does not justify their appropriateness in a learning environment. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "This article examines the productive capacity of emotion through the concept of emotional fundamentalism. Emotional fundamentalism combines several key concepts—fundamentalism, affective labor, biopolitics, and capitalism's contradictions—developed by Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri in Empire (2000), Multitude (2004), and Commonwealth (2009) to describe the intensified attention to the body in education. I investigate the implications of the increased organizational and corporate interest in emotion using an ongoing socio-emotional learning study and the introduction of artificial intelligence aggression detectors in schools. Doing so demonstrates the tendency of Empire to manage emotions in order to ensure viable production by educating the body as data and human capital. However, though Empire depends on emotions as a resource, these same emotions display a creative unruliness that exposes potential avenues to reproduce the common and enact multitude.

        "The COVID-19 global pandemic imposed a pause on life and higher education due to lockdowns and quarantines. Many students faced extreme financial hardship, making it difficult to continue their academic pursuits. The current study compares the pandemic's impact on Sami Shamoon College of Engineering (SCE) students' performance, dropout rate, and satisfaction with teachers before and during the patldemic. Like universities worldwide, SCE faculty scrambled to transition to online learning quickly. Our findings suggest that students were initially frustrated, but they were more understanding by the second semester of the pandemic. However, Arab students were forced to drop out at a disproportionate rate compared to Jewish students. More Arab students dropped out during the pandemic than in previous years, suggesting the pandernic affected them more substantially. Despite all the hardship, student performance did not sutTer.

The participants were 390 undergraduate students from four academic colleges in Israel who responded to the role adjustment to online learning questionnaire and the motivated strategies for learning questionnaire. The quantitative findings showed low adjustment rates to ERT, moderate use of metacognitive strategies, and moderate environmental and personal distractions. Adjusting to ERT was related to gender, age, academic year, environmental and personal distractions, and metacognitive strategies. The findings highlight the different barriers that affected undergraduate students' adjustments to ERT during the first semester after the COVID-19 pandemic began. The rapid changes to teaching-learning educational platforms are challenging higher education institutes (HEIs) to improve their support for diverse students from different backgrounds and academic experiences.

        "The use of online learning courses can have a positive effect in the context of the study and dissemination of Chinese folk music. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of an innovative teaching model of massive open online courses to assess the possibility of changes in the approaches to the study of Chinese folk music in higher education. The study used Massive Open Online Courses and a survey of respondents. The study, which took place from January to July within the framework of the 2020–2021 academic year, involved second-year students from four educational institutions of the People's Republic of China: Zhengzhou Sias College, China Conservatory of Music, Shanghai Conservatory of Music, Fujian Normal University. A total of 419 people participated in the experiment. Comparison of the academic performance in folk music in the two groups of students suggests that the use of online courses in the context of teaching Chinese folk music is effective. The difference is 12.1% compared to the control group. The students noted that working on MOOC platforms helped them better master performance skills. The respondents also appreciated the fact that online courses with developed curricula can be an effective means of popularizing Chinese culture. This study has both practical and scientific value as it demonstrates the effectiveness of the impact of distance learning courses in the context of studying Chinese folk music. The results can be implemented in the development of training programs, the scope of application includes higher educational institutions. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "In order to investigate the overall cognition of blended learning, we made a questionnaire survey and interviews with students and teachers of 10 universities and colleges in Anhui Province. Based on this investigation, we design a Rain class blended learning model which fully utilizes the modern network technology and mobile terminals to closely link pre-class and after-class learning to classroom teaching by using Wechat terminal. In order to validate the application effect of the model, a quasi-experiment is conducted between two groups of students. We used SPSS 23.0 in recording and analyzing the data for inferential statistics, two independent samples T-test, variance analysis and descriptive statistical analysis. The difference was statistically significant with P < 0.05. The study found that students have higher interest and acceptance to blended learning, but miscellaneous online resources and excessive interference information have negative impacts on students' online learning participation behavior. The hypothesis about the influencing factors of blended learning has been verified empirically, that is, perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, a learning atmosphere are important factors affecting learners' acceptance of blended learning. A teaching practice proved that the new learning model has achieved remarkable results in improving learning efficiency and quality of students in large classroom, cultivating students' learning initiative and stimulating their interest in learning.

        "The task of effectively embedding digital technology use in classrooms is among the challenges currently faced by educators in Ireland and internationally. This paper builds on analyses conducted as part of a longitudinal evaluation of Ireland's Digital Learning Framework. Findings suggest that many teachers – especially at the post-primary level – have a somewhat restricted view of what 'embedding' means in this context. Such responses indicate a focus on using digital devices for activities that would be happening in the classroom already, rather than embracing more flexible and constructivist pedagogical approaches to take advantage of the range of options provided by digital technology for teaching, learning and assessment. This implies that even if all of the infrastructure and connectivity needs of schools in Ireland are met over the coming years – itself a substantial task – there is a risk that teachers may not use these devices as effectively as could be. We argue that digital technology in the classroom can open up new possibilities for how education (teaching, learning, assessment) is carried out. We explore how teachers' understanding of the concept of 'embedding' can be strengthened and the envisaged impact on children's education of doing so. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "College students today are much more diverse in their needs than in the past (e.g., they may live off campus, work full or part time, and seek ways to lessen college-related debt). Institutions of higher education are seeking ways to more effectively reach this diverse student population, often through online education. Institutions also realise that faculty are a primary contributing factor to whether or not such programs will be successful. This is because faculty selected to develop and teach online are responsible for both content and delivery; thus, they largely control the quality of the courses offered. Since business is one of the most highly sought-after areas of study online, schools of business must find ways to develop and implement online programs, while ensuring quality and meeting accreditation standards. Deans of AACSB-accredited business schools were surveyed in this study to determine their approaches related to faculty participation in online learning initiatives. Specifically, this study examines variables that are associated with faculty participation in online teaching. Through multiple regression analyses, the study examines which elements of practice are significant in this effort. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "This paper presents the results of a study into the different facets of student engagement during interactive augmented reality experiences presented on individual tablet computers to students in early primary school. The study was conducted as part of a pilot research project \"SCOLLAm,\" researching various approaches to learning with tablets in primary school in Croatia. To explore engagement in such an environment, an experimental approach based on an innovative digital lesson platform is taken, comparing augmented reality‐based digital lessons and multimedia‐based ones. In both approaches the contents are being shared, but presented differently, thus isolating augmented reality effects versus general technological intervention effects, an approach so far not explored in the early primary school context, but important, per existing literature. The data is analysed via video coding based on accepted engagement observational techniques and qualitative analysis. The results show that the AR‐based interactive learning experiences are in general more cognitively and overall engaging in the early primary school context, while having less non‐engagement or disengagement of the students than interactive learning experiences in multimedia digital lessons. Those findings are triangulated via teacher interviews and student focus groups, identifying likely reasons for such a difference, and examining how to best apply the results in everyday educational practice. Practitioner notesWhat is already known about this topicThe effects of Augmented Reality Learning Experiences (ARLEs) on students' knowledge and achievement are a common field of research interest by educational AR researchers.Student engagement is often used as proxy for student achievement as it has shown correlations with it, both generally and in ARLEs, and is thus also commonly of interest.It is difficult to isolate the effects of AR versus the effects of the fact that a technological intervention occurred in general; often requested in recent literature, it has so far been only done in two studies, in early childhood learning and university‐level education contexts.What this paper addsThe paper presents an experimental study on engagement of students during ARLEs in early primary school (ages 7–8), one of the contexts most interesting to researchers, comparing lessons using the same contents in ARLEs and multimedia digital lessons, thus isolating AR effects from general technological intervention effects.The study shows ARLEs in this context providing more cognitive and overall student engagement, while having less non‐engagement or disengagement.Student focus groups, composed of students exposed to both AR and non‐AR lessons on tablets, explain this engagement by their perception of ARLEs as educational play.Implications for practice and/or policyWith the building up of the corpus confirming engagement benefits, researchers and teachers can more confidently assume their presence when preparing ARLEs in primary school contexts, making for a stronger case for the use of ARLEs in this context.The findings, triangulated with teachers' and students' focus group feedback, support deploying ARLEs for review and reinforcement of learned contents.Not originally targeted, the findings give underlying empirical support for further research into AR Game‐based Learning, a developing field.

        "Background: Researchers debate whether game‐based learning (GBL) affects students' achievement emotions, as past studies yielded mixed results. Objectives: This study determines the overall effect of GBL on students' positive achievement emotion and their negative achievement emotions (PAEs, NAEs), along with their moderators. Methods: This meta‐analysis examined true or quasi‐experimental studies, reported in English or Chinese, and with students (ranging from primary schools to universities) who did not report physiological and/or psychological illnesses. Results: Compared to traditional instruction, GBL had a positive effect on students' PAEs (g =0.526, k = 39, 95% CI = [0.319, 0.733]) and a negative effect on NAEs (g = −0.517, k = 22, 95% CI = [−0.709, −0.324]). GBL's positive effects on students' PAEs were (a) largest in middle school and otherwise generally larger in higher grades, and (b) largest for competition GBLs (compared to cooperative or individual GBLs). GBL's negative effects on students' NAEs were (a) larger in collectivist cultures than individualistic ones, (b) progressively larger in primary school, middle school, and university, (c) larger for non‐digital games than digital games, (d) smallest for individual games, (e) progressively larger in mathematics, social sciences, language, science, and highest in engineering and technology, and (f) smallest for extremely short or extremely long intervention durations (very short: up to 45 min; very long: over 2 months). Take Away: GBL often increases students' PAEs and decreases their NAEs, though their effect sizes differ across cultural values, grade level, game type, academic subject, or intervention duration. Hence, educators should consider these aspects when designing / selecting education games for their students and instructional contexts. Lay Description: What is already known: There are many definitions concerning educational games, resulting in a lack of consensus in conceptualisation.The impact of educational games on students' learning and development has aroused significant interest among scholars.As previous studies have shown mixed results, whether GBL supports or hinders students' achievement emotions remains ambiguous. What this paper adds: Contribution to a clarification of the overall effect sizes of educational games on students' positive and negative achievement emotions (PAEs and NAEs).Insights into the impacts of educational games on students' PAEs and NAEs taking into account some moderator variables (e.g., cultural values, grade level, game type, academic subject, intervention duration). Implications for practice: Planners, implementers and evaluators of GBL should carefully consider the appropriateness of digital games in learning.GBL can be appropriately applied in teaching to control the fluctuations of middle school students' NAEs.Concrete suggestions for future research are discussed.

        "Designed for this study as a conceptual framework comprising particular educational approaches and techniques for mathematics teaching and learning, the Successful Mathematics Classroom (SMC) aimed to promote college students' mathematics self-efficacy, motivation, and achievement. Through using a case study methodology, a range of tests and interviews, we investigated the effects of the SMC on a sample of 130 freshmen students from a mathematics foundation programme in everyday classroom practice. The results showed a positive correlation between students' self-efficacy and achievement, as well as their motivation and achievement. The results further revealed that there was a positive impact of using the SMC framework on students' mathematics self-efficacy, motivation, and performance. The elements with most impact were teacher's teaching methodology, group work, teacher's attitude, and gamification. Further research is recommended to examine the effects of SMC in different education settings, different students, teaching styles, and larger sample sizes. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have highlighted the need to equip young students with basic AI-related knowledge, skills, values, and attitudes. However, pedagogical design for AI literacy remains a critical challenge, especially for upper elementary students aged 10–12. This design-based study had two goals: to develop a pedagogical approach for AI literacy in upper elementary education and to empirically assess this approach through an experiment. One hundred forty-seven sixth graders in an upper elementary school were randomly assigned to a control group (n = 75) and an experimental group (n = 72). Following a theory-informed design convention, we proposed a dual-contrast pedagogical (DCP) approach. This approach centers on human-AI comparisons by integrating analogies and cognitive conflicts. Two teaching examples on machine learning and large language models were provided. The experimental group was taught with the DCP approach, while the control group received conventional direct instruction. Data drawn from assessment tasks and questionnaires were subjected to two-way analyses of variance and covariance. The experimental group demonstrated significantly higher performance in AI knowledge, skills, and ethical awareness. They also exhibited a significant increase in AI learning confidence and intrinsic motivation and a significant decrease in learning anxiety. The DCP approach significantly improved students' learning performance and attitudes, demonstrating its effectiveness in promoting AI literacy. This study highlights the pedagogical value of human-AI comparisons in teaching AI, while contributing to a research agenda on the cognitive and conceptual aspects of AI education. • This study designs and assesses the dual-contrast pedagogy (DCP) for AI literacy. • DCP is to compare AI with humans through analogy and cognitive conflict. • A two-way experiment was conducted (2 pedagogical approaches x 2 levels of gender). • DCP outperformed the conventional approach in learning performance and attitude. • The significant effects demonstrated medium to large effect sizes.

        "The Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada (RCPSC) recently redesigned the Canadian neurosurgery residency training curriculum by implementing a competency-based model of training known as Competence by Design (CBD) centered around the assessment of Entrustable Professional Activities (EPAs). This sequential explanatory mixed-methods study evaluated potential benefits and pitfalls of CBD in Canadian neurosurgery residency education. Two four-month interval surveys were distributed to all Canadian neurosurgery residents participating in CBD. The surveys assessed important educational components: CBD knowledge of key stakeholders, potential system barriers, and educational/psychological impacts on residents. Paired t-tests were done to assess changes over time. Based on longitudinal survey responses, semi-structured interviews were conducted to investigate in-depth residents' experience with CBD in neurosurgery. The qualitative analysis followed an explanatory approach, and a thematic analysis was performed. Surveys had 82% average response rate (n = 25). Over time, most residents self-reported that they retrospectively understood concepts around CBD intentions (p = 0.02). Perceived benefits included faculty evaluations with more feedback that was clearer and more objective (53% and 51%). Pitfalls included the amount of time needed to navigate through EPAs (90%) and residents forgetting to initiate EPA forms (71%). There was no significant change over time. During interviews, five key themes were found. Potential solutions identified by residents to enhance their experience included learning analytics data availability, mobile app refinement, and dedicated time to integrate EPAs in the workflow. This study was the first to assess resident-perceived benefits and pitfalls of the neurosurgery CBD training program in an educational framework context. In general, residents believed that theoretical principles behind CBD were valuable, but that technological ability and having enough time to request EPA assessments were significant barriers to success. Long-term studies are required to determine the definitive outcomes of CBD on residents' performance and ultimately, on patient care. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "National policies on school digitalisation take shape in their local contexts. Consequently, to understand the outcome of national policy, the local translations must be set within a contextual perspective. This article explores how four contextually different municipalities in Sweden translate national school digitalisation policy. It draws on a comparative cross-case study with data gathered from interviews, and over 150 local documents dating from 2018 to 2020. The results show how contextual aspects affects responses to national policy, and that municipalities approach school digitalisation in two distinct ways. The first, general approach, emphasises competitiveness and the creation of an enabling environment for the teachers. This is manifested in the development of special support organisations, and generous access to digital technology. The second, specific approach, emphasises local consensus in policy translations along with unity in policy adherence. Here, critique of national policy is explicit. The two approaches exemplify how translational power may be distributed differently, the former prioritising individual translational precedency for teachers over a unifying policy translation controlled through local governance. The paper suggests that contextual factors matters in the choice of approaches, one in which size matters. The paper concludes that policy makers need to acknowledge contextual dimensions within governance by weighing translational power in relation to translational coherence. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "The aim of the present study was to compare the possible effects of a gamified programme and a traditional instructional approach in secondary physical education at the level of intrinsic motivation, autonomy satisfaction, competence satisfaction, relatedness satisfaction, and intention to be physically active. A total of 54 year-nine students (14 ± 0.1 years) enrolled in two classes in the same high school participated. The school administration (totally anonymous to the study) distributed all the students among the two classes and the research team randomly considered one the experimental group (n = 27, 13 boys, 14 girls), which experienced a gamified learning unit, and the other the comparison group (n = 27, 15 boys, 12 girls), which followed a traditional instructional approach. Both study groups had the same physical education teacher with training and experience on several pedagogical approaches, including gamification. The study followed a pre-test, post-test quasi-experimental research design (the time lag between pre-test and post-test was nine weeks). The results showed significant differences at post-tests favouring the experimental group in all the variables assessed. In conclusion, the results from the present study provided support for the use of gamification in physical education since it was associated with increased levels of students' intrinsic motivation, basic psychological needs and intention to be physically active more than a traditional approach. Therefore, gamification could be considered a positive pedagogical framework for secondary physical education. Nevertheless, more studies with larger variability in contexts, participants and content are needed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "Universities around the world are facing unprecedented challenges as a result of the corona virus. There has been global devastation of the entire education sector with long-term closure of schools. The health crisis and the accompanying education crisis continue, and the end of the crisis is not certain. The immediate response everywhere to the outbreak of the virus was closure of university campuses, disrupting almost all academic activities everywhere. After the immediate reaction, as a short-term response, universities began offering some core programmes in education and research by adopting digital technology. While some feel that online methods have improved overall access, many argue that they exacerbate existing inequalities in access to higher education and research among several groups of population. As the global health emergency is still continuing, it is widely noted that we need to develop, after initial immediate responses, short-term, medium- and long-term plans for developing robust higher education and research systems that contribute to knowledge development, reducing inequalities, and which can face future uncertain emergencies. The paper reviews some of the important developments that have taken place, and different perspectives that are emerging on the responses needed for the transformation of higher education in the post-COVID era.

        "The shutdown of schools due to the Covid19 epidemic has generated a move towards online education. The operation of an electronic instructional system in many higher learning institutions was a major challenge. Online instructional system namely Moodle possesses some characteristics that are important for its operation in the era of the covid19 epidemic. Nevertheless, the effective implementation of the electronic instructional system depends on grasping the determinants that confront the modern electronic instructional system. Therefore, this inquiry aims to examine the determinants that influence learners' operation of the instructional learning system in the period of covid19. This inquiry adopted a quantitative research design. A convenient sampling approach was employed to choose a sample size of 276 students. The result of the inquiry found that all the nine determinants elucidated 53.8% of the change in utilization of the online learning system. Of the nine determinants, social influence and system quality contributed substantially to learners' utilization of online learning system. Implications for the study were also discussed.

        "The purpose of this study was to explore high school physical education students' usage and perceptions of a supplemental online health-related fitness knowledge curriculum through the lens of the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology. Individual interviews were conducted with 37 students who were enrolled in a ninth-grade physical education class. The course used an externally provided online curriculum designed to deliver and assess health-related fitness knowledge. Initial themes were generated using open and axial coding compiled into a codebook. The codebook was pilot-tested and finalized following peer debriefing sessions. Four main themes were developed: Home(room), Alone ; Easy to Use, Easier to Ignore ; Disconnected and Conflicted ; and Low Value, Low Priority. Students completed their online work alone, but location and devices varied. Most thought the online platform was easy to navigate, and many completed multiple modules at once. Students sensed that the online content was disconnected from face-to-face physical education and questioned why they were required to engage in sedentary online learning for a physically active course. They also expressed difficulty understanding the value of the online content and assigned a low priority to completing it as a result. Implementing a supplemental online physical education curriculum presents challenges given the relative novelty of the modality within the subject. This study highlights the important role system design plays in the online learning process. It also illustrates the responsibility teachers have in helping students see the value of online learning opportunities by making connections to their own lives. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

Data were collected from the Web of Science, and a total of 60 SSCI-indexed journal articles were retrieved for bibliometric synthesis. Drawing on the revised technology-based learning model, participants, learning strategies, research methods, research foci, adopted technologies, and application effectiveness, advantages, and challenges were addressed. The findings demonstrated that publications were increasing rapidly, and that most articles were published in computer-assisted language learning, educational technology, and applied linguistic journals. The most common target language was English as a foreign language, and the most common learners were college students. In most studies, technologies were mainly used for the purposes of practice or exercises. Mixed, quantitative, and qualitative methods were frequently adopted, with a particular eye on the experiment design, questionnaires, and other specific methods in the second decade. Productive language skills, along with autonomy, satisfaction, and motivation, were major research foci. Language management systems and computer and web-based applications were frequently adopted technologies. Findings of application effectiveness, advantages, and challenges were summarized.

        "The social and emotional wellbeing of all students, regardless of setting, is recognised as a fundamental requirement for successful learning and social development. The COVID-19 pandemic of the past two years has witnessed disruptions to teaching and learning and peer relationship development for students. Societies have been in lockdown; learning has gone online; schools and universities have been delayed in opening/returning and operating in hybrid forms, with some students off-and-on campus at different times; and new university students have arrived in 2022 after two years of disrupted school learning and interrupted peer and social relationships. These challenges highlight the importance of pastoral care in these settings for all stakeholders. The authors reflect on their university's approach to supporting staff and students as they pivoted rapidly to online learning and how the pastoral care/social and emotional strategies they employed offer opportunities for positive outcomes moving forward.

        "This research aims to determine the technostress levels experienced by teachers in distance education during the COVID-19 period and examine the relationship between this technostress level and job satisfaction. The research was structured in relational comparison type. The attendees comprised 525 teachers working at different echelons of education, determined in accordance with the purposive sampling method. Technostress Scale, job satisfaction scale, and open-ended questions form were used as data collection tools during the research. The data were collected online through Google Forms due to COVID-19 conditions. Descriptive statistics, backward hierarchical multiple regression (BHMR), MANOVA analysis, and inductive content analysis were used for the data analysis. According to the research findings, it was figured out that teachers were exposed to intensive use of technology in distance education, this negatively affected their life and performance, their workload increased, and they had to put much more effort to adapt to modern technologies in the Covid-19 pandemic period. It was found that the teachers' job satisfaction levels were high in general, and the female teachers' job satisfaction levels were higher than those of male teachers. The job satisfaction levels of private school teachers were lower than those of public-school teachers. In the research, the gender of teachers and the institution type they work under, both being among the main factors affecting teachers' technostress level, were determined to make a significant difference. However, the distance education process, conducted during the COVID-19 period, was also noted to involve educational, psychological, and administrative challenges. Based on research results, it is recommended to improve teachers' online learning and technology literacy skills, and review present undergraduate programs in terms of preparation for distance education.

        "How does platformization work as vehicle for the integration of public online education into a private global digital infrastructure? And how can education technologies ('edtech') be governed at various levels to benefit the public good? In this article, we examine online environments in primary schools in The Netherlands, a traditionally strong public-school system, where platformization has substantially impacted the precarious balance between private and public interests. Mapping the Dutch edtech landscape, we trace how the integration of digital learning platforms and learning management systems into digital learning environments are propelled by two complementary yet competing strategies: interoperability and intraoperability. We argue that the latter challenges the first. Securing education's public interests necessitates a coordinated governance effort at the sectoral, national and European levels.

        "The ideas and philosophies of preservice secondary music teachers (PSMTs) are formalized in their tertiary education years. In these years, PSMTs must reconcile the expectations, beliefs, and values espoused by their lecturers, tutors, and other significant people from their past. PSMTs have accumulated various musical experiences through prior interactions with their primary and secondary school teachers and private tutors, which nurture and shape the kind of teachers they anticipate becoming. This research focuses on a group of six PSMTs who face a very different future, teaching in the COVID-19 world of digital delivery amid a time of curriculum change in New South Wales (NSW), Australia. Thirty-minute Zoom interviews with the six participants took place over the two semesters of 2020, beginning before the COVID-19 outbreak in Australia and investigating how prepared PSMTs felt they were for classroom teaching. Their most positive responses regarding online learning provided evidence that their music lecturers had built PSMTs' understanding of the curriculum, which increased their confidence in their musical ability during practicum. The findings in this article provide an informed NSW perspective about PSMTs' tertiary education, adding to research about classroom music pedagogy. Finally, the opinions of PSMTs on their current learning and future careers are of importance and interest for both tertiary education institutions and curriculum designers. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "Background: With the rapid popularization of e‐learning, how to improve online learning has aroused widespread concern. A human‐like pedagogical agent (PA) that displays eye gaze and gestures, is often added to online multimedia lessons to increase social connection and improve learning in e‐learning environments. However, there has been a debate about how PAs affect learning processes and learning outcomes. Objectives: Social agency theory holds that learners can build a social connection with PAs, which affects learning processes and outcomes. This study seeks to reveal how PAs influence learning by exploring the influence of PAs on learning outcomes and brain activity during learning. Methods: College students viewed a multimedia lesson on the process of chemical synaptic transmission either with or without an embodied PA on the left side of the screen that pointed to the graphic as she lectured. During learning students' brain cortical activity was measured by a functional near‐infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) system, and after learning students completed learning outcomes post‐tests. Results and Conclusions: Consistent with social agency theory, students learning with a PA performed better on learning outcome tests and showed greater brain activity in the social areas of the brain during learning based on fNIRS measures. Implications: By using fNIRS technology, this study provides preliminary new support for the idea that learners engage in social processing during online learning with an embodied PA that leads to improved learning outcomes. Lay Description: What is already known about this topic: With the rapid popularization of e‐learning, how to improve learning effect of online learning has aroused widespread concern.A human‐like pedagogical agent who displaying eye gaze and gestures is often added by educators to increase society and improve learning in the online learning environment.The empirical results are inconsistent on the effect of pedagogical agents on learning and the mechanism of the influence of pedagogical agent on learning is still unclear. What this paper adds: An embodied agent can enhance learners' memorization and understanding of knowledge in the multimedia learning environment.An embodied agent can enhance learners' brain activity related to social information in the multimedia learning environment.The social agency theory has been preliminarily proved, which assumes that the pedagogical agent can prime a social stance in the learner and lead to deeper cognitive processing during learning. Implications for practice and/or policy: Educators should consider embedding embodied pedagogical agents into online instructional materials to increase sociality and improve learning.

        "The aim of this study is to demonstrate effectiveness of mobile game called SOS Table in the context of the subject \"Tenses in English\" within the framework of mobile learning tools acceptance, learning language motivation and mobile learning attitude of the students. The target group of the research consists of preparatory class students of a school of foreign languages in a state university in Turkey. The research was carried out with mixed method research. The quantitative paradigm-based section of this study was designed with a single-group pre-test and post-test model. In this model, three different scales were applied to the participants. The participants used the SOS Table mobile game developed by the researchers for 8 weeks. After the applications, semi-structured interviews were conducted with seven participants. The quantitative data of the study were analyzed with paired sampled t-Test and the qualitative data were subjected to thematic content analysis. The results of the study indicated that the mobile application named SOS Table increased both the mobile learning tools acceptance of the participants and motivation in English, and mediated the positive attitude development for mobile learning in English. The qualitative data obtained also supported these findings. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "Rational number knowledge is a crucial feature of primary school mathematics that predicts students' later mathematics achievement. Many students struggle with the transition from natural number to rational number reasoning, so novel pedagogical approaches to support the development of rational number knowledge are valuable to mathematics educators worldwide. Digital game-based learning environments may support a wide range of mathematics skills. NanoRoboMath, a digital game-based learning environment, was developed to enhance students' conceptual and adaptive rational number knowledge. In this paper, we tested the effectiveness of a preliminary version of the game with fifth and sixth grade primary school students (N = 195) using a quasi-experimental design. A small positive effect of playing the NanoRoboMath game on students' rational number conceptual knowledge was observed. Students' overall game performance was related to learning outcomes concerning their adaptive rational number knowledge and understanding of rational number representations and operations.

        "Background: Motivation is an important factor in the learning process and supporting students' motivation in mathematics is a significant challenge for educators. Educational technologies, such as digital games, offer potential for engagement in mathematics learning activities. Objectives: To contrast the general decrement in student motivation in mathematics, a multilevel meta‐analysis was carried out to synthesize the results of studies concerning the impact of digital games on K‐12 student motivation in mathematics. Methods: Standardized measure of effect size (dppc2) for pre‐ post‐control group designs was used, and different sources of dependency among the effects were taken into account. Moreover, through meta‐regressions, we examined whether specific characteristics of the participants, interventions and outcomes were associated with effect size differences throughout the studies. Results and Conclusions: A total of 20 primary studies (43 effect sizes) meeting eligibility criteria was included. Results showed a significant overall effect (dppc2 = 0.27; 95%CI = [0.14; 0.41]) and a great heterogeneity between studies. Moderator analyses showed differences in effect size associated to the duration of intervention and motivational construct in terms of expectancy and value. Implications: Overall, the findings indicate that digital games are effective tools compared to conventional teaching practices. The results are promising and could be useful for the design of digital educational interventions aimed at promoting motivation in mathematics. Lay Description: What is already known about this topic: Motivation in term of expectancy and value is an important factor in the learning process.Digital games influence student motivation to learn in K‐12 education.Concerning mathematics, previous meta‐analyses studied the effects of digital games on math achievement but not on motivation. What this paper adds: This meta‐analysis synthesizes the impact of digital games on motivation in mathematics.The targeted learner audience is K‐12 students.Results show a significant overall effect of digital games on motivation and a great heterogeneity.The effect is greater if motivation is measured in terms of expectancy than of value.The duration of intervention moderates the effect: short interventions have the highest effects. Implications for practice and/or policy: Digital games promote motivation in mathematics for K‐12 students compared to conventional teaching practices.Engaging and innovative educational activities, such as digital games, might contrast the worldwide decline of enrolments in the STEM field.

        "In this study, the transformational play approach was further used to deploy drama‐based situational learning in the classroom through the Digital Learning Theatre (DLT) by engaging drama performers and the audience collaboratively. This study analysed the learners' learning effectiveness based on translation and sentence‐construction abilities, and their perception by focussing on concentration, and comprehension of dialogues before and after the drama‐based activity. The experimental results were based on both the DLT including tablet PCs to enable audience participation in drama performances, and the DLT for drama performances in which the audience can participate through traditional open discussion sessions with the narrator of the drama. Sixty‐five students were selected randomly as participants from the English as a Foreign Language academic program at the junior high school level. The application of the DLT including the tablet PCs approach showed considerable improvement in students' learning effectiveness as well as a significant positive effect on classroom learning, outperform the effectiveness of the DLT with traditional open discussion sessions for the audience. Accordingly, to improve students' learning effectiveness, their engagement in the learning process can be advanced through situational learning activities using educational technologies that combine with collaborative learning mechanisms for classroom learning. Practitioner notesWhat is already known about this topicThe transformational play proposed by Sasha Barab is designed based on situated cognition theory to position persons, content, and context together through digital games.Dorothy Heathcote proposed a drama‐based learning approach for learning in the classroom, and learners can play various roles in the drama to learn in a situational learning setting. The teacher, too, plays a role to guide the students and engage them in the situational learning setting.Integration of immersive educational technologies supports learning by reducing obstacles to adoption in the learning process and improve learning effectiveness.Within a rich contextual learning environment, learners can be placed in different situational learning tasks that allow them to apply existing knowledge and experiences.What does this paper addThis study introduces a manner of applying the transformational play approach in drama‐based situational learning activities suitable for collaborative learning in a classroom setting.It introduces a practical and simple method to transform a regular classroom into a digital version of the learning theatre, including a virtual stage to drama performances.The drama‐based situational learning approach facilitates the audience as well as the performers to transform themselves into protagonists in the learning context by collaboratively following the learning content and learning with their peers.The technology‐enhanced drama‐based situational learning approach is introduced based on the transformation play approach that allows the students to learn situationally through different script instances, and improves their learning effectiveness by helping them understand the learning content through performing, participating, watching, and interacting in the learning context.Implications for practice and/or policyLearners can apply their prior knowledge and experiences creatively through drama‐based learning activities, and interactive engagement allows the audience to participate in the learning process equally as drama performers.Educators and learning system developers can implement this approach to facilitate situational practice and discuss learning content.The learning process supports the reinterpretation of the learners' experiences and reflects on how to procure/adopt new knowledge and apply it to real‐life situations.Drama performance is a collaborative/group learning task and it is performed for the audience. Students with higher achievements will help students with lower achievements so that everyone can contribute in the learning process to achieve their learning objectives. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "Early School Leaving (ESL) as an important societal issue has been a matter of debate in policy making for 30 years. But the differences in students' experiences have often been neglected, leading to a one-size fits all policy and pedagogical approach. This paper explores educational experiences of dropouts in England, Denmark and Hungary, and compares the measures related to ESL. Empirical data were collected from observations; a total of 28 interviews with students in three different country contexts. My original contribution to knowledge is that this study focused on students' experiences in education and career trajectories with a comparative lens and was able to give a more distinct image of dropouts. The paper recommends that rigid education systems need to adopt more flexible methods and adaptive learning pathways to work with challenging youth. Transitions to secondary education should be supported by career practitioners to help students find suitable pathways. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "The term educational disadvantage represents a circumstance where some persons benefit less than others from the educational system, manifesting in fewer opportunities for engagement in education, lower levels of participation in formal education, and poorer educational outcomes. While complex factors underpin educational deprivation, international research is in broad agreement that economic deficiency and social isolation contribute to underachievement at school which, in turn, perpetuates the cycle of poverty. Based on a review of literature, this paper examines the response from the education authorities in Ireland to educational disadvantage between 1965 and 2020, highlighting responses from the Department of Education that have focused on increased funding in digital and information technology and on projects providing equality of access to education from preschool to third level. Notwithstanding the growth in retention and participation rates in education over the past 55 years, it is contended that the continuance of poverty demonstrates both the multidimensional aspect of socioeconomic disadvantage and the requirement for greater interdepartmental and community collaboration in its amelioration. Finally, the paper draws attention to shortcomings in the official digital and information technology strategy for schools shown up by COVID-19 - a time of sudden school and college closures, resulting in virtual classrooms becoming a forum for learning. A wide variation in response, throughout primary, post-primary and third-level education suggests that, after 25 years of investment in digital technology, the embedding of information and assistive technology necessary for delivering lessons on line has not occurred.

        "As new technologies pave the way to increasingly sophisticated and academically relevant experiences, gamification of the learning process, regardless of the field of expertise, becomes more and more important. This study aims to express several constructs that explain how one can apply Game-Based Learning to education while granting motivational success, attitudes, flow and learning. In this sense, in the present article, several theories have been used and related to each other, namely Landers' Theory of Gamified Learning, Self Determination Theory, Flow Theory, and Planned Behaviour. The aim was to understand how Motivation, Flow and Attitude dimensions, which were obtained by applying Games Based Learning resources to the teaching of Accounting, can influence Perceived Learning. These constructs were examined to see how they influenced the Perceived Learning of Accounting (N = 816) college undergraduates who used AccountinGame like a quiz with contents learned in the classes. This research contributes to the current body of literature on Game-Based Learning in Accounting Education. Results clearly showed there is a robust relationship between the proposed framework dimensions. In this sense, after students had used games in Accounting curricular units, it was observed that Motivation and Attitudes influenced Perceived Learning, unlike Flow, which had no statistical influence.

        "Young children use, engage with, and experience digital technologies in their home and early childhood settings, yet their presence and use can be fraught with tensions and uncertainties. This paper reports on an Australian study focusing on how early childhood teachers perceive and manage parental concerns about their child's digital technology use in kindergarten. Grounded theory was the methodological approach used to give insights into the early childhood teachers lived experiences. The findings revealed that early childhood teachers who taught kindergarten children, aged three-and-a-half to four-and-a-half years of age, experienced parents voicing concerns about their child's digital technology use and made requests for mediation. Differences were identified between the children's home environment and kindergarten setting regarding children's access to digital devices, expectations for use and digital mediation practices. To manage the concerns parents raised, early childhood teachers endeavoured to educate and reassure parents about the nature of digital technology use in kindergarten. This paper invites early childhood professionals to reflect on how they respond to parental concerns about digital technology and to consider the role they play in educating parents about how digital technologies are used in kindergarten.

        "The COVID-19 pandemic and its resulting stay at home orders have had significant effects on mental and behavioral health. College and University students are at particular risk of mental and behavioral health issues due to the social distancing, stay at home orders and the abrupt shift from face-to-face to online learning. This study aimed to determine the impact that stay at home orders have on health behaviors such as mental health, physical activity, screen-time, and alcohol consumption have on social work students. Results indicated a statistically significant increase in anxiety and depression scores during the pandemic as compared to prior to the pandemic. In addition, there was a significant increase in screen time during pandemic as compared with prior to pandemic. The results of this study suggest a need for increased support for student during social distancing and stay at home orders. Implications for social work education are also discussed.

        "The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the health, wellbeing, learning, housing and living arrangements, work and family life of students worldwide. This study analysed the effect of the implementation of remote learning on Palestinian-Arab female students from a college in Israeli periphery. This article aims to address the perpetuation of inequalities vis-á-vis gender-ethno-national-civil status on online learning, focussing on family relations and infrastructure. My qualitative study of Palestinian-Arab female undergraduates during the crisis shows that students were forced to study in a shared family space because they did not have their own room and sometimes shared equipment. Furthermore, they were drawn into family obligations, which reinforced their traditional gender role. The data indicate that these circumstances impair their ability to study. The study sheds light on the role of gender family relations in barriers to persistent devotion to higher education and success in attaining an undergraduate degree. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "Teaching Machine Learning in school helps students to be better prepared for a society rapidly changing due to the impact of Artificial Intelligence. This requires age-appropriate tools that allow students to develop a comprehensive understanding of Machine Learning in order to become creators of smart solutions. Following the trend of visual languages for introducing algorithms and programming in K-12, we present a ten-year systematic mapping of emerging visual tools that support the teaching of Machine Learning at this educational stage and analyze the tools concerning their educational characteristics, support for the development of ML models as well as their deployment and how the tools have been developed and evaluated. As a result, we encountered 16 tools targeting students mostly as part of short duration extracurricular activities. Tools mainly support the interactive development of ML models for image recognition tasks using supervised learning covering basic steps of the ML process. Being integrated into popular block-based programming languages (primarily Scratch and App Inventor), they also support the deployment of the created ML models as part of games or mobile applications. Findings indicate that the tools can effectively leverage students' understanding of Machine Learning, however, further studies regarding the design of the tools concerning educational aspects are required to better guide their effective adoption in schools and their enhancement to support the learning process more comprehensively.

        "Online learning is currently adopted by educational institutions worldwide to provide students with ongoing education during the COVID‐19 pandemic. Even though online learning research has been advancing in uncovering student experiences in various settings (i.e., tertiary, adult, and professional education), very little progress has been achieved in understanding the experience of the K‐12 student population, especially when narrowed down to different school‐year segments (i.e., primary and secondary school students). This study explores how students at different stages of their K‐12 education reacted to the mandatory full‐time online learning during the COVID‐19 pandemic. For this purpose, we conducted a province‐wide survey study in which the online learning experience of 1,170,769 Chinese students was collected from the Guangdong Province of China. We performed cross‐tabulation and Chi‐square analysis to compare students' online learning conditions, experiences, and expectations. Results from this survey study provide evidence that students' online learning experiences are significantly different across school years. Foremost, policy implications were made to advise government authorises and schools on improving the delivery of online learning, and potential directions were identified for future research into K‐12 online learning. Practitioner notesWhat is already known about this topic Online learning has been widely adopted during the COVID‐19 pandemic to ensure the continuation of K‐12 education.Student success in K‐12 online education is substantially lower than in conventional schools.Students experienced various difficulties related to the delivery of online learning.What this paper adds Provide empirical evidence for the online learning experience of students in different school years.Identify the different needs of students in primary, middle, and high school.Identify the challenges of delivering online learning to students of different age.Implications for practice and/or policy Authority and schools need to provide sufficient technical support to students in online learning.The delivery of online learning needs to be customised for students in different school years.

        "The impact of teacher-led and learner-led mobile learning activities on increasing learners' motivation and learning outcomes has been reported as effective. However, the relationship between them remains unclear. In this study, the authors investigated the relationship through survey (n = 366) and interview (n = 7) data collected from students in one of the most prestigious medical schools in China. Three lessons are learned. First, confirmatory factor analysis validated a two-factor model on the use of mobile devices. The participants spend more time on studying with teacher-led than student-led activities. Second, structural equation modelling results suggest that the use of teacher-led mobile activities has a positive impact on learner-led activities and students' satisfaction with overall teaching quality. Third, students perceive mobile devices as useful learning tools when teacher-led activities are present, whereas in the absence of teachers' involvement, student-led activities are perceived as less efficient than other forms of learning.

        "In the early nineteenth century, the ideas of reform pedagogues gave rise to a didactic turn towards the visual that criticised an exclusive textual mediation of knowledge through books and lectures. To raise educational effectualness, teachers came under increasing pressure to incorporate high-profile media technologies into their lessons. Yet, top-down initiatives to implement new instructional technology often fell short of expectations when logistical and financial challenges and teachers' practices and preferences were not taken into account. However, most of the existing studies on the introduction and proliferation of high-profile educational technology in late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century Western education have focused on industry-led promotional efforts or governmental initiatives to introduce commercially produced media into the classroom. As such, they lend insight into the normative discourse surrounding the construction of the ideal of the tech-savvy teacher, but have mostly overlooked teachers' agency, as well as the difficulties teachers met in the implementation. This paper investigates how, between 1900 and 1940, Belgian secondary school teachers dealt with the tension between professional pressures and expectations on the one hand, and their individual preferences and possibilities on the other hand. It does so by comparing the discourse of educational media advocates and governmental actors with teachers' accounts of their visual media practices as documented in teachers' pre-class preparations and notes.

        "Virtual Reality is an emerging educational technology due to its potential immersive, interactive and imaginative characteristics supporting pupils in the learning process towards meaningful learning. Furthermore, the current teaching of history is generally too traditional, making the subject being perceived as pointless and boring by students. These aspects lead to poor academic performance. In this context, this study focuses on analysing the eventual benefits of Virtual Reality in the teaching of history at Primary Education and compares its results with those of traditional teaching resources in two dimensions, academic performance and the motivation of students. Thus, an intervention was performed with 98 fourth graders divided into two groups, control and experimental. For the collection of the data referring to motivation, an adaptation of the Instructional Material Survey instrument from Keller [(2010). Motivational design for learning and performance: The ARCS model approach. New York, NY: Springer] was used while, in relation to the evaluation of the academic performance, a specific test was designed taking as reference the tests of the coursebooks for the unit of work \"The Roman Civilization\" of the subject Social Sciences. The results show statistically significant differences in favour of those students who used Virtual Reality, both in motivation and in academic performance. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "Digitalisation and the accompanying transformation processes, involving data, technology and people, are part of children's life and will shape their future. Competences, such as digital skills, as well as creativity, communication, collaboration, critical thinking and problem solving are crucial to these transformation processes. In early childhood, these competences are essentially acquired through play, especially pretend play. The project 'we play the future' draws on the potential of pretend play to enable young children to be actively engaged in imagining themselves shaping digital transformation in the roles of inventors, developers and users. Drawing on an analysis of fields currently undergoing digital transformation, eight inputs for pretend play were developed to areas of digital transformation (eg, robotics, autonomous vehicles and Internet of things). Fifteen kindergarten teachers implemented the pretend play on digital transformation in their kindergarten after taking a half‐day introductory professional development course. The children's play was filmed and analysed using qualitative multimodal interaction analysis in order to examine the ways in which the pretend play encourages the exploration of digital transformation amongst the children. The results reveal the potential of pretend play for children to explore digital transformation and to acquire the digital competences needed in the future. Practitioner notesWhat is already known about this topic? Children integrate imaginative digital technology in their play.Guided pretend play is important for children's learning in kindergarten.What this paper adds Ideas for pretend play in kindergarten to enable children developing an understanding of digital transformation in a playful wayThe paper presents findings from video analysis which indicate that children are using competences needed for the digital future during pretend playImplications for practice Digital education should not just be focused on using and programming digital devices but include pretend play to explore digital transformation; through the inputs for pretend play suggested in the project, the kindergarten teachers support the children developing an understanding of digital technology.The inputs for pretend play enable children to develop competences such as technical and digital skills, as well as creativity, communication, collaboration, critical thinking and problem solving.

        "The rapid development of big data and artificial intelligence has brought impact on every aspect of people's lives. However, college students' education is still relatively traditional in that all students receive the same instruction, which hinders the improvement of students' performance. Students need more personalized teaching based on fast-developing technology. This paper introduces the design and implementation of an intelligent education prototype for an electronic systems course, and 89 students were given customized learning based on this prototype. The intelligent education prototype is based on the teaching platform to assist education. On the one hand, it provides students with various teaching resources. On the other hand, it makes statistical analysis based on the behavior data of students on the platform. so as to assist teachers in adjusting teaching strategies. To verify the effectiveness of our teaching method, we compared these students' final scores with the scores of other students who used traditional teaching methods. Student performance is assessed using examination results, The results indicate that the average score of the students who used the intelligent education prototype is 6.3 points higher than those who used the traditional teaching mode. The prototype proposed in this paper provides a reference for improving online education and is expected to positively influence the teaching of other courses in the future. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "Background: As educational digital technologies are increasingly being used in schools, past research left unanswered the question of these technologies' impact on the socioeconomic achievement gap even when equal access is guaranteed. Objectives: The objectives of the present study are to examine whether and how the socioeconomic achievement gap can be reduced through the use of computer‐assisted instruction (CAI). Methods: We addressed this issue experimentally by comparing CAI to conventional teacher‐led classroom instruction with more than 800 middle and high school students from disadvantaged and highly privileged socioeconomic backgrounds in a range of topics. Results and Conclusions: Both disadvantaged and highly privileged students taught with CAI outperformed those taught with conventional instruction, thus maintaining the socioeconomic achievement gap constant. However, we also found that disadvantaged students receiving CAI performed as well as highly privileged students receiving conventional teacher‐led instruction. Takeaways: The positive effects associated with CAI may therefore help compensate the difficulties of students with a disadvantaged background, a still neglected possibility. Lay Description: What is already known about this topic?: Socioeconomic status affects academic achievement especially in students from disadvantaged backgrounds.Inequal access to digital learning is a by‐product of socioeconomic status.Computer‐assisted instruction is known to yield positive effects on learning. What this paper adds?: It examines the effectiveness of computer‐assisted instruction on reducing the socioeconomic achievement gap when equal access to digital education is guaranteed at the school level.It shows that computer‐assisted instruction (relative to teacher‐led conventional instruction) benefited disadvantaged students and their highly privileged counterparts equally, shifting the socioeconomic achievement gap upward.However, disadvantaged students receiving CAI may reach similar performance level as their highly privileged counterparts receiving conventional instruction, thus compensating the socioeconomic achievement gap. Implications for practice and/or policy: This finding strengthens the importance of targeting teaching methods depending on students' socioeconomic characteristics to allow disadvantaged students to maximize their learning potential and chances to access to higher education.

        "People's day-to-day routines have changed drastically since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. One of the changes to take place has been the transition to online learning due to the changing conditions in learning environments. One of the factors that guide students through learning environments is their emotions. The few existing scales that measure the emotions of adolescents in learning environments have been developed with consideration of face-to-face learning environments and their items do not adequately express the state of online environments. For this reason, this study aimed to develop a scale which reveals the emotions of adolescents that may affect their academic success with regard to this transition of learning environments as they attend online lessons. A total of 3,655 middle and high school students living in Istanbul, Turkey, participated in the study. The scoring system was designed with regard to the frequency with which each student reading an item experiences the relevant emotion for the item in the online learning environment. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses conducted show the scale to possess a four-dimensional structure. These dimensions are enjoyment-pride, boredom-hopelessness, loneliness and anxiety. For all dimensions of the scale, Cronbach alpha values range between.93 and.83. 'Positive and Negative Affects Schedule-Children' was used to confirm the scale's criterion-related validity, and correlations between dimensions were examined. After validity and reliability studies, the Adolescent Emotion Scale for Online Lessons was found to be sufficient. The scale can be used by experts and teachers who wish to determine adolescents' emotions during a period of online learning. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "In line with the widespread proliferation of digital technology in everyday life, many countries are now beginning to use computer-based exams (CBEs) in their post-primary education systems. To ensure that these CBEs are delivered in a manner that preserves their fairness, validity, utility and credibility, several factors pertaining to their design and development will need to be considered. This research study investigated the extent to which the design of different types of test items (e.g. inclusion of multimedia stimuli) in a CBE can affect test-takers' engagement and behaviour. Qualitative data from a cued-Retrospective Think Aloud (c-RTA) protocol were gathered from 12 participants who had participated in a previous eye-tracking study. Participants watched a replay of their eye movements and were asked to state out loud what they were thinking at different points of the replay. Thematic analysis of the responses from these cognitive interviews captured the nature of students' interactions with online testing environments under three main themes: Familiarisation, Sense-making and Making Decisions. Students also provided their opinions of and recommendations for the future of Irish online assessments. These findings can offer guidelines to all stakeholders considering the use of CBEs in post-primary contexts. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "With the outbreak of COVID-19 in early 2020, school buildings across the globe closed, leading educators, students and families to transition rapidly to online education. It is clear that schools will in the future continue to employ online learning, even as students and educators return to school buildings. While the education community has over a number of years generated a range of practical tips and guidance about online education—especially since the onset of COVID-19—many are not supported by research (DiPietro et al., 2010) and neglect international school settings (Barbour, 2014). This study investigates the experiences of sixty-one K-12 international educators via nineteen focus groups, contributing to the literature base on pedagogical, leadership and practical strategies needed to support effective online learning. Four lessons learned emerged from the data: technological challenges are exacerbated during a crisis; educators adapted to revise pedagogical strategies when under pressure; student and parent experiences were inconsistent and complex; and school leaders play an important role during a transition to online education. Although COVID-19 posed challenges, educators are resilient, adaptable, and deeply committed to student learning. School leaders now have an opportunity to reconstruct a model of education which offers students the best of face-to-face learning augmented by the most effective use of virtual technologies. This is more than planning for potential crises; this is reimagining the future of education. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "During the school closure in the COVID-19 pandemic, students with special needs including gifted students faced many challenges in terms of educational support. The Turkish Ministry of National Education released a mobile app named \"I am special, I am in education\" to overcome these challenges. This study aimed to explore how gifted children perceived the experience of learning through this mobile app. Using a phenomenological design, the data were collected from 10 gifted students through focus group interviews and student journals. An inductive approach was used to analyze the data. The findings indicated that although gifted students referred to this experience as weird and different, they also stated that using the app helped their learning. They foregrounded that the app needed improvements and a section for live interaction with other gifted students and teachers to increase their motivation. This study suggests some implications for mobile app developers, educators, and parents. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "The emergence of the COVID-19 virus has generated the greatest worldwide disruption of education systems (among others) in generations. In Israel, from the beginning of the pandemic, all universities and colleges quickly adopted an online education system, while the other educational systems did similarly, in part or in full. This study examines the impact of the involuntary immersion of students and instructors into digital learning environments due to the COVID-19 pandemic – the impact on the pedagogical practices, pedagogical conceptions, and inclinations toward pedagogical change of university and college instructors during the \"Corona Related Teaching Situation\" (CRTS). Our research followed a mixed-methods approach, combining qualitative with quantitative components. The explanatory design is a two-phase mixed methods–approach design, which began with the collection and analysis of quantitative data and was followed by the subsequent collection and analysis of qualitative data. The current report places special emphasis on the qualitative components of the research. The major contribution of this article is the development of a typology based on a conceptual model that allows for the identification of three teacher profiles that emerged during the CRTS: Experienced teachers, Enthusiastic teachers, and Cautious teachers. The study found that the main variable affecting a teacher's fit into one of these profiles is the level of digital literacy before the crisis. Our typology can be applied to different crisis situations and can be useful for the training and development of university teachers in the field of digital literacy. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "This study investigates the distance learning process of teachers during school closure due to COVID-19's impact. This research focuses on the introduction of distance learning, the obstacles faced by teachers and approaches to addressing different hurdles in the implementation of distance learning. This study collected data from mathematics and science teachers spread in junior and senior high schools in Aceh Province, Indonesia. Data were collected through a questionnaire from 353 teachers and interview from 6 teachers to get in-depth information related to the focus of this study. The results of the study revealed that teachers could not directly utilize various Information and Communication Technology (ICT) devices and online learning platforms that are widely available in supporting distance implementation, either due to the ability of teachers, parents' economic factors, limited internet access, and the absence of guidance. However, over time, the teacher can independently adapt to environmental conditions and the characteristics of students in carrying out distance learning. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "The entropic state that engulfed the East Coast of Australia in the first eight months of 2020 followed thirty years of uninterrupted economic growth and 10 years of tenuous federal governments divided on the question of climate change. The twin geophysical crises of catastrophic bushfires and the COVID-19 pandemic have led to a public reckoning around our guardianship of the environment, as well as our relationship with science and indigenous knowledge. Congruent with this was the rapid transformation of both schools and universities to online learning, causing the most significant rupture to the traditional 'grammar of schooling' for decades. This unprecedented conflation of crises has resulted in the unusual situation where education can be radically transformed, as the material conditions that usually remain latent (thus negating the possibility for change) suddenly exist. As a result, there has been an increased openness to pedagogies of potentiality, as schools and universities resist the urge to 'return to normal'. Amongst these pedagogies, the philosophy of Bernard Stiegler is unique in its direct response to the entropic state with a counter-impulse, negantropy, which seeks to harness our technological capacity under an ethos of care and unite it with our existential purpose to flourish and thrive. This paper will consider the possibilities of Stiegler's utopian call for action in relation to the Australian context, as schools and universities reconceptualise the sharing of knowledge and the purpose of education that seeks to rectify the gaps of the past.

        "Gamification is becoming increasingly popular in primary education due to the widespread use of digital technology. However, gamified reading is new, and there is little empirical evidence regarding its effectiveness. The sustainability of the effects of gamification pedagogy is also in doubt as some scholars think that such effects are short‐term and not sustainable. This paper presents the results of three sub‐studies of examining the effects of an online gamified reading platform and the sustainability of these effects. Study 1 examined the change in students' academic performance between two groups divided based on their different participation levels. Study 2 addressed the question of how students/parents/teachers perceive students' motivation and gaining in the use of the gamified platform. Study 3 explored the sustainability of the effects of the gamified platform from a longitudinal perspective. Findings suggest that students' deep engagement in the gamified e‐learning platform can help increase their reading motivation and improve their reading abilities. Such effects can be sustained for several semesters. Practitioner NotesWhat is already known about this topic Reading is very important for children's development. However, the ubiquity of digital entertainment (eg, digital games & online videos) occupies children's attention and energy, resulting in a decline in children's reading motivation.At present, gamification has been widely used in e‐learning to increase learners' learning motivation and engagement.Few studies have focused on children's gamified reading supported by sufficient empirical evidence.What this paper adds This study proposes a gamification pedagogy with a gamified reading platform to facilitate primary students' reading motivation and competence.This study uses a mixed‐method approach to examine the effects of the proposed gamification pedagogy on students' reading interest, motivation, habits and abilities.This study explores the sustainability of the gamified platform effects and fills the research gap regarding the sustainability of gamification pedagogy.Implications for practice and/or policy Active users of the gamified reading platform benefit from it in reading interest, motivation, habits, and abilities.The effects of gamification pedagogy can be sustainable when users' intrinsic learning motivation is aroused.

        "In this study, a flipped classroom strategy was integrated into a comparative experiment to report on the performance of classical Chinese learning in two learning scenarios, using both game-based and animated story materials or only animated story materials as pre-course preview supports. A total of 75 senior high school students participated in the experiment. Overall, the findings showed that integrating elearning materials with physical activities fostered flipped classroom learning, and learners had a deep impression of the targeted classical Chinese. The use of the game-based learning materials for preview triggered the students, especially the low-achievement students, to become active learners. It was found that the game-based learning materials helped the students to have a whole view of the article quickly, so it would be beneficial to provide learners with game-based learning materials at the beginning of introducing new classical Chinese units to arouse their learning motivation. Meanwhile, the animated-story materials were helpful for enhancing learners' concepts of important classical Chinese sentences and wording, and could be provided to learners according to the schedule of the course. The issues of how to run a flipped classroom with e-learning materials and further research directions are also discussed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "Background: Mobile learning studies often focus on teachers' perspectives. This study instead considers students' experiences of learning with mobile devices (i.e., m‐learning) in secondary school mathematics and science. Objectives: The research aims to describe the m‐learning experiences of secondary mathematics and science students, and to determine the extent to which distinctive pedagogical dimensions impact students' perceived learning. Methods: A survey instrument using the iPAC mobile pedagogical framework as a theoretical lens is developed and validated. This framework highlights three pedagogical dimensions: personalization, authenticity, and collaboration. Structural equation modelling is used to investigate how each dimension predicts students' perceived improvement in learning, whilst accounting for usage context, among a sample of students in schools where mobile devices are used extensively. Results and Conclusions: Students were in agreement that personalization was a characteristic of their m‐learning experiences, but authentic and collaborative learning were not as strongly featured. M‐learning activities fostering personalization were most important for improving perceived learning; authenticity and collaboration were also significant, but no differences in perceived learning improvement due to location were found. Authentic m‐learning and perceived improvement in learning with mobile devices were significantly higher in science than mathematics subjects. Implications: When teachers design m‐learning tasks that enhance personalization, collaboration, and authenticity, students are predicted to perceive improvements in their learning. The findings suggest that teachers should consider designing technology‐enhanced tasks that improve students' experiences of collaborative and authentic learning, particularly in mathematics for greatest gains in students' perceived improvement in learning. Lay Description: What is already known about this topic:Mobile learning studies often focus on teachers' perspectives and practices or expert commentaries.Issues of usability, access, engagement, motivation, and potential risk are often highlighted rather than pedagogical factors.Mobile technologies provide students with opportunities for more personalized and autonomous seamless experiences across learning contexts.Science teachers frequently use authentic and project‐based m‐learning opportunities, whilst mathematics teachers prefer didactic, drill and practice approaches.What this paper adds:This study focuses on students' m‐learning in secondary mathematics and science.A multi‐item scale considering aspects of authenticity, personalization, collaboration and context is developed and validated.Personalization in m‐learning activities are most important for perceived learning, followed by authenticity and collaboration.Science students report greater authenticity and perceived learning in m‐learning than mathematics students.Implications for practice and/or policy:Highlighting the student perspective is a valued lens to evaluate m‐learning pedagogy and outcomes in student learning.Efforts should be made to develop mobile pedagogies, particularly with respect to authenticity and collaboration.Teachers in mathematics would benefit most from examining practices that improve authenticity.

        "This study mined student interactions with visual representations as a means to automate assessment of learning in a complex, inquiry-based learning environment. Log trace data of 143 middle school students' interactions with an interactive map in Research Quest (an inquiry-based, online learning environment) were analyzed. Students used the interactive map to make scientific observations for an evidence-based hypothesis. The examination of classification error using an artificial neural network, compared against the majority class for prediction, suggests that student performance on several metrics of critical thinking can be classified based on different patterns in interactions with visual representations. Two alternative methods are compared in this study for training and evaluating data-mined models of student performance. In accordance with the general consensus in the literature, the error estimates for models' predictions were less variable using a student-level cross-validation. Implications of these findings for open-ended inquiry-based learning environments are discussed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "COVID-19 forced extreme measures in cities worldwide, including school shutdowns and limited social contact. Semi-structured interviews with 14 Israeli music teachers were conducted to expose the challenges of teaching musical instruments and vocal during social distancing, focussing on struggles and technical challenges, teacher-student relations, and creative leveraging. The study explores solutions or advantages to online teaching offered by the participants' experience, while also stressing advantages of face-to-face lessons, which could have been taken for granted. Music educators who participated in the study reported that the pandemic forced them to accommodate teaching methods, demonstrations, and physical guidance, which required reshaping to online communication; latency and poor sound quality required compromise and adjustment. They shared perceptions of online learning, coping methods, creative approaches, attentiveness to students, temporary solutions to technical problems, and forward-looking insights. The role of the teacher as a source of empathy and human connection was highlighted, as was the need for face-to-face, intimate lessons. Findings indicate that online music lessons enable creative methods that may enrich future post-pandemic lessons, but that their positive effect on the learning process is of a short-term nature. The study's limitations include teachers' nationality, and future research could examine cultural and gender coping differences. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "Covid-19 has affected the everyday educational lives of students, teachers, administrators, and parents. Parents who are living in low-income and disadvantaged communities are probably more likely than others to have been affected by the pandemic in relation to their children's distance learning. This study focused on the perceptions, predictions, and suggestions of female breadwinner parents from low-income families regarding their children's distance learning. Data were collected from 12 mothers who participated in a three-stage focus group study. The data from the focus group discussions were thematically analyzed into three categories: (1) financial issues, (2) social and cultural issues, and (3) educational issues. Additionally, the findings presented the breadwinners' general and technological reasons for their predictions for enhancing education in the future if schools return to face-to-face learning or pursue a blended learning approach. The breadwinners suggested three approaches to teaching and learning for the following academic year. The findings of this study may be useful in the development of educational policies and training programs to provide essential social and technological support to low-income families to address their needs in the online learning environment and to improve digital equity for low-income families who are likely to be educationally disadvantaged.

        "In this study, we adopt an ecological perspective to reflect on how a specific Italian school cluster adapted to the challenges of the COVID‐19 pandemic by focusing on how students experienced the interplay between continuity and change in school teaching and learning practices caused by the pandemic. Specifically, the study investigates how the school's physical/virtual learning system was (re)configured to provide new opportunities for learning to a thousand‐plus population of primary and secondary students, and how they reacted to the transition to distance learning in terms of participation, autonomy, motivation and engagement. The research adopts a mixed method approach, based on school management system data and a survey tool, and analyses the students' response to the emergency from the perspectives of the students themselves, their teachers and their parents. While these converged in positive evaluation of the experience, a number of lessons were learnt, such as the importance of building on favourable pre‐existing conditions and leveraging a solid shared school culture to promote a prompt reaction to the emergency. Significantly, students with an immigrant background displayed varying degrees of participation in online activities. Overall, for each of the three stakeholder groups surveyed, solid pre‐existing digital competence levels and close collaboration within the school community were the most important factors for non‐traumatic transition to distance learning. Practitioner notesWhat is already known about this topic? Research on the relationship between the COVID‐19 pandemic and the effects on teaching and learning processes is constantly increasing.Most recently published studies focus on higher education, while very few investigate the impact of the COVID‐19 pandemic on K‐12 education.Very few papers have studied the interplay between change and continuity within an educational ecosystem in times of crisis.What this paper adds? This is one of the first studies to analyse the process of systematic transition from onsite learning to online learning within the Italian school system in response to the pandemic.This study employs a multiple perspective research approach to analyse Emergency Remote Education in a sizeable school cluster, with a specific focus on student response.Teachers, students and their families all saw solid pre‐existing digital competence and close school community collaboration as key factors facilitating rapid adjustment to the emergency.Implications for practice and policy Having a solid common school culture to rely on facilitates prompt emergency reaction.Encouraging the creation of professional communities of practice that comprise both expert and novice teachers can help prepare educators to deal with an educational emergency through adoption and appropriate use of technological solutions.Collaboration between school and families proves to be a key factor for dealing with emergencies.

        "The current educational disruption caused by the COVID‐19 pandemic has fuelled a plethora of investments and the use of educational technologies for Emergency Remote Learning (ERL). Despite the significance of online learning for ERL across most educational institutions, there are wide mixed perceptions about online learning during this pandemic. This study, therefore, aims at examining public perception about online learning for ERL during COVID‐19. The study sample included 31,009 English language Tweets extracted and cleaned using Twitter API, Python libraries and NVivo, from 10 March 2020 to 25 July 2020, using keywords: COVID‐19, Corona, e‐learning, online learning, distance learning. Collected tweets were analysed using word frequencies of unigrams and bigrams, sentiment analysis, topic modelling, and sentiment labeling, cluster, and trend analysis. The results identified more positive and negative sentiments within the dataset and identified topics. Further, the identified topics which are learning support, COVID‐19, online learning, schools, distance learning, e‐learning, students, and education were clustered among each other. The number of daily COVID‐19 related cases had a weak linear relationship with the number of online learning tweets due to the low number of tweets during the vacation period from April to June 2020. The number of tweets increased during the early weeks of July 2020 as a result of the increasing number of mixed reactions to the reopening of schools. The study findings and recommendations underscore the need for educational systems, government agencies, and other stakeholders to practically implement online learning measures and strategies for ERL in the quest of reopening of schools. Lay Description: What is already known about this topic: The current educational disruption caused by COVID‐19 pandemic has led to a plethora investment and the use of educational technologies for Emergency Remote Learning.There are wide mixed perceptions about online learning for Emergency Remote Learning during the current pandemic.There is little to no research conducted to examine public perception about online learning for Emergency Remote Learning during COVID‐19.The research paper's significant contribution is to investigate the opinions and perceptions of people around the world on COVID‐19 and Online Learning related issues. What this paper adds: Twitter was selected for this study due to its wide application and the ease of collecting tweets.Machine learning techniques, including world clouds, sentiment analysis, cluster analysis, correlations analysis, and trends analysis, were applied to identify useful insights..The study revealed topics like 'covid', 'learning', 'online', 'distance', 'students', 'schools' and 'pandemic' as the most mentioned words worldwide with nearly half of the public sentiments being positive (48.9%) and neutral (36%).Reopening of schools has received lots of mixed reactions and online learning appears to be a sustainable option during these unprecedented times. Implications for practice and/or policy: Theoretically, this study corresponds to literature relating to COVID‐19, online learning, and Emergency Remote Learning by exploring word frequency, discussed topic, public sentiments, relationships between themes, correlation, and trend analysis.This study recommends that educational institutions, government agencies and other stakeholders should work together to ensure an efficient and effective online learning policies, implementation, and its utilization for Emergency Remote Learning (ERL) as we fight the pandemic.Also, schools need to consider providing further support for educators and students by delivering workshop trainings on the importance and effective use of the online learning system for Emergency Remote Learning (ERL).Further, counselling services are strongly recommended to be made available online for educators and students to increase their teaching and learning morale.

        "The years from birth to five are critical for building the emergent literacy skills that precede learning to read and write. Early childhood education and care services are in a unique position to support emergent literacy development, particularly for children in socio-economically disadvantaged communities. This article reports the findings of a small cluster randomised controlled trial of the Let's Read professional development program involving 12 centres and 223 educators in Australia. Through eLearning and on-site coaching, the program of relatively short duration and intensity supported educators of children from birth to school age. While the small sample size means the results must be interpreted with caution, the findings were promising. Despite variation in the fidelity of implementation, educators and centres in the intervention group showed more positive scores after participating in Let's Read than those who did not across all areas of educator practice and classroom quality. Changes were most encouraging for educators of infants and toddlers. These results suggest there is measurable value in professional development involving coaching for improving emergent literacy-promoting practices of early childhood educators, including those working within disadvantaged communities. Concurrent fidelity and impact research should be undertaken with any wider implementation. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "Motivation theory is indispensable when discussing processes of learning. Learners who are motivated can learn almost everything. Students' motivation is probably one of the most important factors for teacher effectiveness both for engagement in the learning process and high academic performance. To have effective environmental education, it is not only necessary to inform the public about the ocean but also to involve and engage them is essential. Motivation and engagement are some of the most commonly mentioned concepts in gamification, thus, a gamified application seems to have the necessary features to improve the motivation of students in the learning context of Ocean Literacy topics. The main aims of this work were: i) to understand through a systematic evaluation, how game elements affect the different motivation layers; and ii) to compare them in terms of enhancing the motivation to recycle among secondary school students (11-14 years). To measure students' motivation, a pre-test and a post-test using a recycling situational motivation survey were administered in a classroom environment in Portugal and the UK. Findings show a trend regarding the effect of game elements mainly on the most autonomous forms of motivation. The different game elements, each one with different degrees of effects, were shown to have potential to increase motivation. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "The K-12 Spring 2020 COVID-19 school closures saw teachers move into an online learning environment, and use their knowledge of technology, pedagogy, and content (TPACK) to develop online learning for the remainder of the school year. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between teachers' self-efficacy as measured by TPACK and their perceived success and satisfaction for delivering online learning during the emergency COVID-19 school closures. A web-based survey was conducted of in-service K-12 teachers instructing remotely. While teachers felt competent in technology integration and felt successful with the remote instruction in Spring 2020, teachers were not always satisfied with their online experience. Furthermore, content area proved to be a factor in predicting both success and satisfaction with online instruction. Teachers with a stronger understanding of their content area and instructional strategies related to the content did not feel their students were successful nor did they feel satisfied with their work online. Results from this study suggests additional support is needed for teachers to bring their teaching to an online platform. School districts should invest in the support and resources needed to provide teachers with professional development specific to grade level and content. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "Initiantinnen und Initianten von Schulreformen warteten meist mit ambitionierten Versprechen wie Effizienzsteigerung, Individualisierung oder Humanisierung auf. So auch in der Unterrichtstechnologiedebatte der 1960er und 1970er Jahre, in der die Wortführenden dank neuer Unterrichtsmedien wie Schulfernsehen, Sprachlabore oder sogenannter Lernmaschinen u.a. eine Effizienzsteigerung des Unterrichts versprachen und mitunter gar die baldige Ersetzbarkeit von Lehrkräften durch Maschinen prophezeiten. Während jüngst die \"Digitalisierung\" der Schulen ausgiebig diskutiert wird und bereits einige Studien zu Unterrichtstechnologien im zwanzigstes Jahrhundert vorliegen, ist die Bedeutung von Technologien für den Schulalltag bisher weitgehend unerforscht geblieben. In einer Fallstudie untersucht der Beitrag eines der seltenen Schulexperimente mit Lernmaschinen, das von 1968 bis 1972 im Schweizer Dorf Gelfingen im Kanton Luzern durchgeführt wurde. Gefragt wird nach den Umständen des Beginns, Verlaufs und Ausgangs des Experiments sowie nach der Bedeutung der Lernmaschinen im Schulalltag. Dabei geraten die Mechanismen von Schulreformen am Beispiel eines avancierten Schulexperiments ins Blickfeld der Untersuchung. (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",
        "School reformers regularly came up with ambitious promises such as increasing efficiency, individualisation, or humanisation. This is evidenced as well in the debates on the role of educational technology such as school television, language laboratories, or the so-called teaching machines in schools in the 1960s and 1970s. Additionally, the advocates of educational technology promised an increase in efficiency of teaching and sometimes even prophesied that teachers could be made redundant. This was especially the case for teaching machines that were based on cybernetics and the theory of behaviourism. Those machines made it possible to fantasise about \"electronic schoolmasters\", since they promised to be able to take over the essential functions of teachers. Whilst the \"digitisation\" of teaching in schools has been discussed extensively recently, and there are already some historical studies on debates about technology in teaching in the twentieth century, the relevance of technologies for everyday school life has remained largely unexplored. The case study examines one of the rare school experiments with teaching machines from 1968 to 1972 in a Swiss elementary school in the canton of Lucerne. The study asks about the circumstances of the beginning, development, and outcome of the experiment as well as the importance of teaching machines in everyday school life. To this end, the (1) beginnings of the school experiment by means of planning documents from one of the former teachers is first analysed. An (2) analysis of the newspaper reports in the local press which aim to clarify how the experiment was publicly presented and how the experiment ended is then conducted. An exemplary (3) analysis of the euphoria and disillusionment of school reforms based on the publication of the initiator Lothar Kaiser supplements the case study, before finally, (4) the relevance of the teaching machines in this school experiment is evaluated. In addition to the archive documents and publications, interviews with Lothar Kaiser and Gotthard Amstutz, the two key figures who implemented the experiment, are used. In the end, this case demonstrates the extraordinary fusion of progressive education concepts and teaching technologies. Furthermore, the analysis of this experiment sheds light on how school reforms are intertwined with local political contexts and how crucial social networks are, and raises questions concerning the relevance of technology for everyday learning in school.

        "This study aims to investigate the effect of chatbots that work with artificial intelligence on the success of students and their opinions about chatbots in the 'Matter and the changing state of matter' unit in the 5th grade science course. In addition to text-based functions, the designed chatbot includes a video accessed on the web to support students visually and aurally. The chatbot was designed using the Dialogflow program and an instant messaging program made available to students through a group created on Telegram. The study, which used a quasi-experimental pretest-posttest design, included 41 participants (n = 20 for the experimental, n = 21 for the control group) studying in the 5th grade of a state secondary school in the 2020-2021 academic year. Results suggest that although there was no significant difference between the experimental and control groups in terms of academic achievement, it was determined that the chatbot application positively affected the online learning experience of the experimental group students. Students' opinions about the chatbot included that it was useful and fun, they would like to use it for other courses, it provided useful assistance in learning outside the classroom, and it allowed them to repeat the course again. The results showed that, especially during the Covid-19 pandemic, such applications could contribute positively to students' learning. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "Educational indicators have revealed that a significant portion of Brazilian Basic Education students have a less than satisfactory skill level in reading and solving Mathematics problems. Despite several proven benefits, adaptive learning technologies are scarcely used with low-income students in public schools' due unavailable resources and lack of technological infrastructure. Nonetheless, there is a great expectation that the access to new technologies will assist and improve teaching practices and contribute to enhance learning performance. This study aimed to identify good and bad pedagogical practices from teaching and learning processes using a gamified Intelligent Tutor System (ITS) in Elementary Education. In order to achieve this goal, a case study was conducted with a qualitative research approach based on observations made in classrooms in a 9 months period and the application of Framework Analysis as a data analysis technique involving 6 teachers and 112 students aged between 9 and 21 years old from public schools in Brazil. Results presented provide evidence of significant improvement in the domain of Portuguese Language and Mathematical skills. The highlights of the paper are the seven good practices and six bad pedagogical practices with the use of gamified ITS. Additionally, while gamified ITS are important to improve learning and promote more engagement, this study also sheds light on the importance of using gamified ITS aligned with the school curriculum and a clear intervention proposal instead of voluntary use.

        "This paper reports on a mixed-methods study of the Total Reading Approach for Children Plus (TRAC+) program, with a particular focus on its mobile learning element, where tablets and an app called Aan Khmer (Read Khmer) were introduced into Cambodian schools to assist 'struggling students' in Grades 1 to 3 learn early reading. This paper focuses primarily on survey and interview data collected in 2017 from relevant staff members, namely school directors, literacy coaches, teachers and librarians, about this intervention program. 73 school directors participated in the survey and following this, 68 staff members were interviewed, including 15 of the school directors surveyed. Findings indicate that staff members were positive about the program, including the app, and observed improvements in the children's reading. However, several implementation challenges were noted, which echo challenges reported in the literature on carrying out technology-based interventions. This paper offers insights into the importance of alignment between program design and user readiness, which may inform other technology-based programs intended to raise literacy standards in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).

        "This article reports on teachers' experiences of ICT training in rural areas of Nepal. It discusses aspects of policy documents to help understand the Nepali educational context, before highlighting the challenges of establishing and maintaining infrastructure and professional learning opportunities across a country with challenging terrain and extreme environmental conditions. It then examines teachers' perceptions in five rural primary schools about their experiences of training to use modern educational technologies in instructional activities. The findings indicate that none of the teachers received training in the use of ICT in their initial teacher education and that the Government has allowed non-governmental organisations to provide ICT infrastructure and training for rural schools and teachers. Although this is a small study, it offers insights into the gap between policy and practice and highlights the contextual challenges of Nepal's attempts to operate on a global educational level as well as the challenges for teachers.

        "Background: There has been increasing interest in online professional learning networks in a variety of social media platforms, especially in Twitter. Twitter offers immediacy, personalization, and support of networks to increase professional knowledge and the sense of membership. Knowing the topics discussed in Twitter and the factors that affect the duration of a topic would help to sustain and reconstruct Twitter‐based professional learning activities. Objectives: The purpose of this study is to analyse the topics discussed and what factors affect the duration of a specific topic in 6 years within a virtual professional learning network (VPLN) using #Edchat in Twitter, based on media richness features. Methods: Internet‐mediated research and digital methods are used for data collection and analysis. Various text, natural language processing, and machine learning algorithms were used along with the quantitative multilevel models. This study examined 504,998 tweets posted by 72,342 unique users by using #Edchat. Results: There were 150 topics discussed over the 6 years and multilevel random intercept regression model revealed that a specific topic discussed in the #Edchat VPLN is discussed longer when it has more tweets, rather than retweets, posted by a high number of different users along with moderate text, high or moderate mentions with more hashtags. Takeaways: The study developed an automated social media richness feature extraction framework that can be adapted for other theoretical applications in educational context. Emergent topics discussed in Twitter among #Edchat VPLN members for professional development were identified. It extends the social media richness theory for educational context and explore factors that affect an online professional learning activity in Twitter. Lay Description: What is already known about this topic: Professional Learning Communities have started to use both synchronous and asynchronous Web 2.0 and social media platforms where they may exchange information and develop a sense of belonging with others who share common interests.Synchronous online activity in social networking sites, such as Twitter, can be an effective, informal and a free way to convey information and create and develop personalized networks.Twitter offers immediacy, personalization, and support of networks to increase professional knowledge and the sense of membership.There have been a great number of hashtags in Twitter for educational context and those hashtags are used by teachers to find information and resources and gain new perspectives and ideas from their colleagues or experts.The richness of a social media post varies according to how it is structured and constructed. What this paper adds: By using #edchat in Twitter, educators discussed 150 topics in 6 years.The most discussed topics are Creating, changing school culture; Classroom management, teaching methods; Classroom settings, Educational technologies; Support – Needs; Students' subject skills and interest; and School environment.A specific topic stays longer when it has more tweets, rather than retweets, posted by a high number of different users.Topics that have moderate text, high or moderate mentions with more hashtags are discussed longer on Twitter.The duration of a topic can be changed according to the educators' behaviours in a synchronous online chat. Implications for practice and/or policy: Importance of social media for professional learning and how to sustain a topic for better learning and understanding.Developing and applying an automated computational discourse analysis social media learning.Applying media richness theory to understand the affordances of social media learning.Quantifying the influence of various factors on the discourse in social media learning.

        "In wealthy countries such as Australia, learning and teaching practices in schools have become increasingly digitised as educational technology (EdTech) initiatives gather momentum. This digitisation inevitably involves rendering many dimensions of students' bodies, activities and practices into digital data formats across learning areas: including health and physical education (HPE). These data can be used by schools and third parties to conduct surveillance of students' bodies and learning. This article draws on findings from a project involving interviews with HPE teachers in a diverse array of schools located in eastern Australia about the ways they were using digital technologies for pedagogical purposes. The interviews included questions concerning to what extent the teachers were aware of personal data security and privacy issues related to their students. While the use of datafication technologies such as apps and wearable devices for HPE teaching was common among our participants, for the most part, these teachers were not considering issues such as who could gain access to students' personal information and how these data might be breached or exploited by third parties. These findings are discussed within the broader contexts of young people's personal data privacy rights and schools' role in protecting students' information. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "Constructionism has different meanings for what the learner is constructing, a concrete object or an idea, and whether this construction is done through the use of digital technology. In the embodied‐based environment created in this study, children carry out or \"construct\" a series of actions, a performance, which allows them to solve the task of directing an already programmed robot to a particular target. The activity was based on an adaptation of the Little Red Riding Hood narrative. Children played the role of rangers (instead of hunters) who had to coordinate their actions in order to help a robot (an mBot characterized as a Robot‐Wolf) find Grandma's laboratory, so she could fix its GPS. The children wore boots, which were used to interact with the Robot‐Wolf. The main question we addressed was how to create this embodied‐based environment for kindergarten children, and how to identify the actions children performed and the concepts they used in this construction. The research was based on the Socially‐Aware Design, and the study was conducted in a school setting for kindergarten students. 26 children (11F, 15 M), between 4 and 5 years old, participated in this study. The children's activities were recorded and analysed using the Grounded Theory methodology. The results show that the children's performative sequence of actions is distinct from the hands‐on, heads‐in processes that are part of classical constructionist environments. For the children, the process and the product of their (body) \"dance\" were underlying their movement (perceiving and acting), working together so as to accomplish the given task in the environment. Practitioner notesWhat is already known about this topic Constructionism has shown as a way for learning via materialization of tangible objects or construction of ideas.There are very few examples of constructionist learning environments for kindergarten children to interact with digital technology.What this paper adds The creation of the constructionist embodied‐based environment for supporting kindergarten children interacting with digital technologies.The constructionist embodied‐based environment created was effective in supporting kindergarten children interacting with an already programmed robot.Children's performative sequence of actions reveals no separation of the hands‐on, heads‐in processes as in classical constructionist environments.The creation of a constructionist environment in which children can act and collaborate to construct a series of actions which allow them to solve a specific challenge.Implications for practice and/or policy Concepts like leadership and anticipation which were embodied are expressed by the children help to understand how the robot‐based activity can help children to construct knowledge related to, for example, computational thinking.

        "Digital pedagogies, blended, hybrid, and online learning are not new, indeed discussions about their role in higher education are well documented. With some notable exceptions however, many of these discussions, and many more attempts at implementation, have been small in scale, operating at the level of a single course, or even single members of staff. Barriers at national, institutional and personal levels all contributed to slow uptake of digital learning. The summer of 2020 though saw institutions across the UK, and indeed the world, forced into rapid transition to online learning in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper examines our work supporting a school - which achieved high student satisfaction rates - within a large post-92 university in this transition. With specific attention to academic identity and efficacy, we examine the approaches that were taken in helping academics to climb over the digital hurdle towards good online teaching. We suggest that a three-pronged approach is needed to overcome these barriers and create the belief in digital that is needed for a successful online transition, and for continued growth. This is a collective 'all in it together' approach, placing curriculum, rather than technology at the heart of the work, and also ensuring solid institutional support that does not rely on early adopters.

        "The purpose of this paper is to investigate the mediating role of online learning motivation (OLM) in the COVID‐19 pandemic situation in Bangladesh by observing and comparing direct lectures (DL), instructor–learner interaction (ILI), learner–learner interaction (LLI), and internet self‐efficacy (ISE) as predictors of OLM and online learning satisfaction (OLS). Data were collected from 442 undergraduate and graduate students from more than 35 universities in Bangladesh. To test the hypotheses, the PLS‐SEM approach was applied using SmartPLS 3.0. The study shows a significant mediating role of OLM between the independent variables and learning satisfaction. In addition, DL, ILI, and ISE are shown to be significant predictors of student satisfaction. The findings have a number of valuable implications for education policy makers, universities, instructors, and students. Moreover, the study suggests some new research perspectives to overcome the limitations of this research and to gain precise knowledge on students' learning motivation and satisfaction regarding other online classes for different categories of students (e.g., high school and college, professional, and PhD). Lay Description: What is already known about this topic: Previous studies have been designed to show direct lectures, interactions, and internet self‐efficacy as predictors of student satisfaction in pre‐ COVID‐19 situations.Most of the previous scholarly articles found a mixed result; whether a positive or negative relationship between predictors and the dependent variable. What this paper adds: This study is the first study to explore the mediating effect of online learning motivation on student's satisfaction during the COVID‐19 pandemic from the perspective of a developing country.It concluded, among othe things, that more attention should be paid to students' and instructors' trainings for online learning. Implications for practice and/or policy: Developing countries are implementing online education for the first time, so this study contributes to policymakers, faculties, and universities to design appropriate instruction methods, interactions, course, and curriculum design to cope up with the new normal.This study will contribute concern policymakers to initiate and design necessary training and development programmes to enhance online learning skills and better learning experiences/satisfaction in this pandemic situation.

        "This study aimed to explore how 50 in-service primary school teachers enhanced self-efficacy beliefs in artificial intelligence (AI)-based technology integration into English speaking teaching through a professional development program. Grounded in social cognitive theory, this study revealed that community support assisted the teachers in overcoming challenges in implementing AI-based technology in lessons, leading to the development of enactive mastery experiences. Through these experiences, teachers increased self-efficacy beliefs in AI-based technology integration into English speaking teaching regarding classroom management, student engagement, and instructional strategies. These findings suggest that such experiences can support teachers in transitioning from traditional to AI-based instructional practices. • Professional development programs help teachers gain mastery experiences. • Professional development programs have lesson planning, enactment, and reflection. • Community support helps teachers enact technology-integrated teaching. • Mastery experiences enhance teachers' efficacy for technology-integrated teaching. • Teachers' efficacy changes from traditional to technology-integrated instruction.

        "This paper explores future digital technology policy for education with reference to the Irish context. Framed within the global context of commercial influence on education and related discourses, it addresses the Irish context with particular reference to identifiable 'push' and 'pull' factors seen as influencing policy provision in any next phase. The paper then proceeds to outline a number of intersecting factors or issues that will likely influence digital technology policy and practice in Irish schools in the future, taking into consideration the political, corporate, social, economic and educational backdrop. Likely ethical, environmental and educational factors are proposed and discussed. Looking across these factors, the paper concludes that establishing a clear vision of the role and purpose of technology in education, coupled with a more complex understanding and appreciation of the interaction between technology and education (which is contextually bound and relational, and reflects greater teacher rather than corporate agency) are significant prerequisites to any consideration of the future of digital education in the Irish educational policy context.

        "This small-scale design-based study describes a cyclical model of professional learning between three stakeholders in initial teacher education (ITE) namely: university-based educators (UEs), student teachers (STs) and co-operating teachers (CTs). This model promotes the development of digital learning leaders through an innovative mentoring process. This process started with university-based educators (UEs) mentoring their student teachers (STs) in the pedagogical use of Virtual Reality (VR) and the creation of re-usable learning objects (RLOs). STs were supported and encouraged to cascade this learning to their placement schools as digital learning leaders connecting the innovative practice from the university directly to their classroom practice. Through bi-directional reverse-mentoring the STs and CTs supported each other technically (with the VR) and pedagogical (through the links to the curriculum) to create additional subject-specific RLOs which the STs were able to demonstrate to the UEs on their return to university. Thus, providing the final link in the cycle of learning leaders across the triad of partners in ITE. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "An investigation of teacher and student use of digital devices and tools to inform others about ways to create twenty-first-century digital learning experiences in the classroom and at home. The researchers used a qualitative research design to elicit teacher perceptions and use of 1:1 (device to student) and 1:2 digital devices and tools through survey data from third, fourth, and fifth-grade teachers who were a part of a digital learning pilot in a large public-school district in the Southeastern United States. Teachers used station rotation, individual rotation, and flipped classroom models of blended learning to differentiate instruction and provide digital learning experiences to their students. Teacher-selected digital tools allowed students to use multiple levels of Bloom's Taxonomy. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

We will explore which findings can be generated from freely accessible user reviews within the app stores and on YouTube regarding users' personal backgrounds. the usage contexts, emotions and attitudes. as well as the subjectively perceived qualities and shortcomings of digital learning offerings. 1268 user reviews of frequently used apps and explanatory videos with content from priman· and secondary school mathematics fbi· m the data basis of the article. The results indicate that tile selected digital learning opportunities are predominantly evaluated positively by the users. 11'herebi the perceived qualities mentioned are rather to be classified as surface features. Perceived shortcomings of the digital learning opportunities are mentioned rarely. Regardless of whether the content of the digital learning oppormnities is Clirricularly located in the primary or secondary level. they are more likely to be used by learners from the secondary level. The users also state that they use the learning opportunities primarily for exam preparation as well as for learning and understanding mathematics. However. the latter two fields of uses seem less suitable from a subject didactic perspective. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "This study focuses on preservice Chinese-as-a-second/foreign-language (L2 Chinese) teachers with a theoretical perspective based on prior technology acceptance research in the educational context, to investigate factors influencing preservice L2 Chinese teachers' intention to use educational technology in their future classrooms. Six relevant constructs—intention to use technology, perceived usefulness, attitudes toward use of technology, technology self-efficacy, facilitating conditions and experience of technology use—were incorporated into three hypothesized models. A total of 331 preservice L2 Chinese teachers from two national key universities in China participated in this study. Data were collected via a self-report questionnaire and analyzed through structural equation modeling. Model comparison results showed that the third hypothesized model fit the data best. Specifically, perceived usefulness, technology self-efficacy, and facilitating conditions had direct positive effects on attitudes toward use of technology, while perceived usefulness, attitudes toward use of technology, and experience of technology use showed a positive influence on intention to use technology. This study enriches our understanding of technology acceptance by extending consideration to under-studied preservice L2 Chinese teachers in China. Implications for schools and teacher educators are also discussed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "3D printing is an emerging educational technology that is said to prepare learners for a more technologically designed world. In this review, 3D printing studies are analyzed to identify the dominant theoretical approaches and learning outcomes associated with 3D printing in education. Five theories are identified, including situated learning (Lave & Wenger, 1991), experiential learning (Kolb & Kolb Academy of Management Learning & Education, 4, 193- 212, Kolb & Kolb, 2005), and critical making (Ratto in The Information Society, 27, 252-260, 2011), but concepts from constructionism (Papert & Harel Constructionism, 36, 1-11, 1991) and self-directed learning (Garrison Adult Education Quarterly, 48, 18-33, 1997; Knowles, 1975) are common amongst all approaches. Learning outcomes attributed to 3D printing include critical thinking, creativity, design thinking, and collaboration (Trust et al., 2018; Trust & Maloy Computers in the Schools: Interdisciplinary Journal of Practice, Theory, and Applied Research, 34, 253-266, 2017), with proponents arguing that the domain general outcomes go beyond knowing simply how to use a 3D printer. Given the identified, theoretical approaches, outcomes, and common barriers to use, recommendations are made for how educators approach and implement 3D printing in the classroom.

        "This paper addresses how students design multimodal digital text when making digital stories in school. Drawing on the perspective of 'multiliteracies', multimodal analysis of video recordings was used to understand the data. Findings revealed that (a) multimodal digital text making requires particular digital and modal text‐making skills and knowledge, such as knowledge of photography, film, film editing, image searching, and audio recording; (b) students' prior knowledge was crucial for mastering the digital and modal affordances offered when making digital stories; and (c) making multimodal digital texts in school offers increased opportunities for students to perform and succeed in text making. These findings point to the need for schools to offer education that makes it possible for all students to gain knowledge and master skills needed for contemporary text making. Such knowledge goes beyond skills and practices needed when making paper‐based text, and borders on other disciplines such as art and technology. Practitioner notesWhat is already known about this topic Text making in the 21st century entails working in various modes, such as images, writing, and video, and is often performed with digital resources.Today's students must be competent in designing multimodal texts that are commonly associated with digital technology and multimedia.Students' modal choices when creating digital texts are influenced by prior experiences and knowledge of text‐making practices obtained outside school.What this paper adds This paper provides examples of the differing prerequisites of students designing a digital multimodal story.This paper offers insights into the particular digital and modal text‐making skills and knowledge necessary for students to become competent text makers.Multimodal digital texts activities in school offers increased opportunities for students to perform and succeed in text making.Implications for practice and/or policy The results of this study have implications for literacy practices as well what is included in the literacy curriculum. This study provides implications for education that intends to reduce inequalities in students' prerequisites concerning making digital multimodal texts, and examines the text‐making experiences, knowledge, and skills students already possess upon entering the classroom.Classroom‐based instruction and opportunities for digital creation can bridge the gap between student's informal text‐making activities and formal text‐making activities at school and help to close the digital divide among students.

        "About half of the world's population remains without access to internet in an era of digital transformation. In this study, we aimed to investigate the impact of implementing the use of logic and mathematics through digital literacy on a population of elementary school students in a town in Northeast Brazil. In a non-randomized experimental longitudinal intervention study, 5th-grade students were followed during one semester. They underwent observational testing during class with the use of scales to evaluate their activities in a digital environment, and they were evaluated with respect to their ability to use digital devices. A logic/math assessment was applied prior to and at the end of the course for intervention group and compared to a control group. Questionnaires were used to assess the educators', legal guardians' and students' perceptions on digital habits and their respective sociodemographic features. The intervention consisted of a 16-h long course developed consisting of 8 2-h long classes which focused on digital technology, digital culture, and computational thinking. The students had a strong interest in the classes. Although some students did not have prior contact with computers, their development was outstanding. Digital literacy competencies and technology-use behavior increased throughout the semester independent of family income and use of digital devices at home. Students progressively improved their interaction with the computer (e.g. touchpad and typing skills) and their confidence in the digital environment. Students' scores on the logic/math assessment showed significant improvement. This was not observed in the control group, demonstrating the importance of this type of intervention even with one provided by a 16-h course. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "The purpose of this concurrent mixed-methods study was to assess the quality of online learning with a focus on student motivation in the context of a talent development program. Data were collected from 221 Indian students from fifth to tenth grades for three academic years during their participation in 14 online and 10 in-person courses. Students, teachers, and parents responded to a measure of classroom quality assessing five constructs—appeal, meaningfulness, academic self-efficacy, challenge, and choice. In addition, 41 online sessions were observed by program staff using an additional measure of instructional quality. Participants rated online learning to be highly supportive of learning motivation. No significant differences were observed in student motivation by program format, gender, or program level. Qualitative analysis revealed specific affordances and challenges in supporting student motivation in online learning. Implications in the context of out-of-school programs for students with intellectual gifts and talents are discussed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "The Covid-19 global pandemic has resulted in many countries moving teaching and learning online. South Africa is a country with major inequalities in terms of access to electricity, internet and information technologies, which have created considerable problems for online learning at institutions of higher learning in the country. In this paper, we analyse student feedback from two large undergraduate English courses at a school of Education of a major South African university. We specifically focus on two qualitative questions which asked students about the challenges they faced and the skills they developed in online learning. Results are considered through the lens of critical digital pedagogies and decolonisation. Our findings indicate that a lack of access and resources, disruptive home environments and unfamiliarity with online learning methods were significant obstacles for students. In addition, many students indicated developing computer skills and learning how to use online resources during the courses. The study suggests that online teaching and learning in South Africa and similar contexts exacerbates inequalities, and must be accompanied by rigorous support structures for students who are vulnerable in these contexts.

        "• A total of 68 studies on AI in classroom discourse over the past decade were identified. • Most studies focused on science- and language-related at the primary and secondary school levels. • Various dimensions of classroom discourse were modeled and analyzed by AI. • AI in classroom discourse impacted learning gains, emotions, behavior, and the perception of AI. Over the past decade, multiple artificial intelligence-based models and systems have been developed and employed in classroom discourse as a means of facilitating learning and teaching. To provide valuable guidance for future studies seeking to effectively integrate powerful artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, this paper presents a systematic review of the literature on artificial intelligence in classroom discourse (AICD) over the past decade. Following the latest PRISMA framework, we searched the Web of Science database and the relevant conference proceedings and identified a total of 68 studies. Five themes across the studies were examined: basic sample statistics, educational contexts, data sources, AI technologies, and the effects of AICD. The findings revealed that most AICD studies focused on science-related and language-related at the primary and secondary school levels. Various AI models and systems were developed and used to analyze student-related interaction and learning (e.g., speech acts and collaboration), teacher-related instructional behavior (e.g., question-asking and uptake), and whole-class dialogue (e.g., topic evolution) based on their discourse data in both online and offline classroom settings. Furthermore, the use of AI in classroom discourse was found to be impactful on learning gains, emotions (e.g., willingness and affordance), behavior (e.g., teachers' uptake and students' conversation), and perception of AI. We further discussed the future directions of the field, such as the increasing popularity of deep learning models (e.g., ChatGPT) in investigations of classroom discourse and the urgent need to evaluate the effect of AICD in practice.

        "e‐Textbooks and e‐learning technologies have become ubiquitous in college and university courses as faculty seek out ways to provide more engaging, flexible and customizable learning opportunities for students. However, the same technologies that support learning can serve as a source of frustration. Research on frustration with technology is limited, especially in educational settings. This study examined student frustration with e‐textbooks and the factors contributing to the frustration within undergraduate general biology courses through the development of an E‐Text Frustration scale (ETFS). Exploratory factor analysis of the ETFS revealed a three‐factor structure that provides quantified support for frustration with (1) e‐textbook interactions on the screen, (2) problems with technology and (3) e‐text curriculum integration. This structure was supported by a confirmatory factor analysis. The construct validity of the scale was established using a correlation analysis that revealed significant relationships among the three e‐text frustration measures, cognitive load and motivation variables. Furthermore, the measurement invariance analyses indicated that the scale measures the same construct in the same way in males and females. Overall, the study findings suggest that the ETFS is a useful instrument with high reliability and validity evidence that can be used by researchers and practitioners. Implications for future research on frustration in technology‐rich learning environments are discussed. Practitioner notesWhat is already known about this topicProlonged student frustration can be harmful to learning.Educational technology may introduce an additional layer of factors that contribute to end‐user frustration with technology.Research on frustration with educational technology is scarce.What this paper addsWe developed and validated a scale for assessing students' frustration with e‐textbooks.The E‐Text Frustration scale includes three factors: frustration with technology, e‐text screen interactions and e‐text curriculum.The three factors correlated with students' e‐text cognitive load and motivation to learn.Implications for practice and/or policyThe identified factors represent barriers to students' successful learning with e‐textbooks.Educators can reduce student frustration by aligning the curriculum with e‐text materials.Student sources of frustration with technology should be studied systematically to reduce frustration in technology‐rich learning environments.

        "Because of the heath measures taken during the outbreak of Covid-19, the lack of educational methods has become the primary concern among educational professionals who have been using technology as a motivational tool. Gamification is very important because it helps students to represent their study contents and enrich their experiences of higher education when learning in-person is unavailable during the Covid-19 period. This study seeks to present an Android-based gamification app to evaluate the effect of using gamification and e-quizzes on college students' learning. We used the visual blocks language from the MIT App Inventor platform to develop an application, available at (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=appinventor.ai%5fmekomerofofo.projectGamification). The participants were students from level 2 who used digital lessons for learning MATLAB. The study included gamified learning and non-gamified learning, both integrated into lesson plans, to investigate the differences in learners' performance. Two types of quizzes were used for instruction: gamified e-quizzes and paper-based quizzes. The outcomes plainly showed that using the new gamified e-quiz was more effective than using paper-based quizzes. They are better for assessing the learning performance of the students in question, specifically in terms of formative assessment. It is very important for instructors to apply games as a modern and innovation-oriented tool through which students can be engaged in an attractive, competitive experience. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "The emotional participation of online learning is a process-oriented emotional indicator that measures learners' learning effects. Existing studies have shown there is little research on online-learning emotional participation, and even fewer have studied the online learning participation of ethnic college students. In order to study the online learning participation of ethnic college students, this paper tried to build the online-learning emotional participation theory model, which included four dimensions: learning interest, self-efficacy, self-worth and the sense of belonging. Based on the survey of 723 students from Yunnan Minzu University in China, we analysed the structural and quantitative relationships among the four dimensions of online-learning emotional participation of ethnic and Han college students respectively. The results show that there are significant differences in the online-learning emotional participation between ethnic and Han college students, especially their sense of belonging. Furthermore, in order to build a better online learning environment for ethnic college students and enhance their sense of belonging, an online learning community model is proposed.

        "Students' attitudes and satisfaction are important predictors of educational quality, especially under such special situation as large scale home-based online education during the COVID-19 epidemic. This study investigated middle school students' attitudes and satisfaction about home-based online education during COVID-19 epidemic and potential influential variables. Survey data were collected from 788 middle school students in two typical Chinese public schools. Multinomial logistic regression analysis and ordinal logistic regression analysis were used to identify influential variables. We found that more than half of surveyed students felt that home-based online learning was either the same as (35.9%) or better than (18%) traditional face-to-face learning, while 46.1% felt that it was worse than traditional face-to-face learning. More than six tenth of surveyed students felt satisfied or very satisfied with their home-based online education, while less than one third kept neutral attitudes and very few felt unsatisfied or very unsatisfied. Importantly, the study found some influential variables impacting students' attitudes and satisfaction about home-based online education and they included individual variables (gender, time spent in doing homework, level of learning engagement), organizational variables (school type), and relational variables (time spent on communication and relationship with family members).

        "This study extends the community of inquiry (CoI) framework and self‐regulated learning (SRL) theory through an exploration of the structural relationships among existing CoI variables, learning presence (i.e., self‐efficacy and online SRL strategy) and learning outcomes in the context of K‐12 online learning. To help understand the influence of K‐12 mentoring – which is unique to online learning in the U.S. – mentor presence is also included. Structural equation modelling of 696 online 8th through 12th graders' survey responses and final grades showed that adding learning presence to the CoI framework helped to explain how these learners translated their online‐learning perceptions into cognitive and affective learning outcomes. We also found that mentor presence significantly and positively predicted online SRL strategy, one of the two components of learning presence. Lastly, we established a connection between the CoI model and various types of learning outcomes that are indicators of K‐12 online learning success – though it should be noted that important differences existed between a model based on final grades and two other outcome models. It is hoped that the processes identified in this study will be useful and relevant to K‐12 online‐learning institutions and educators seeking to improve their offering via a wide range of approaches. Lay Description: What is already known about this topic: Community of Inquiry (CoI) framework has been found capable of capturing the interrelationships of collaborative thinking and learning in an online learning settingLearning presence captures learner's metacognitive, motivational, and behavioral aspect.Mentors helped to facilitate students' online learning. What this paper adds: Adding learning presence to the CoI framework helped to explain how learners translated their online‐learning perceptions into cognitive and affective learning outcomes.Mentor presence significantly and positively predicted online SRL strategy, one of the two components of learning presence.Established a connection between the CoI model and various types of learning outcomes that are indicators of K‐12 online learning success. Implications for practice and/or policy: It is important for teachers and mentors to trigger the self‐regulation aspect of the learning presence.Contact between instructors and mentors needs to be strengthened if students' self‐regulation is to be triggered.The importance of establishing and maintaining a positive classroom environment to boosting learning presence.

        "The recent novel coronavirus (COVID-19) crisis has affected humanity and education worldwide as continued learning amidst massive school closures required the unprecedented decision to make a rapid transition from in-person learning to remote online learning. This abrupt and temporary shift to remote online learning due to crisis circumstances was described as emergency remote teaching (ERT). Using a multi-method approach, this study aimed to explore college students' emergency remote teaching experiences during the COVID-19 crisis. Analysis of online survey data revealed the various detrimental effects of the recent outbreak of COVID-19 and emergency remote teaching on the participants' educational and personal experiences. The results revealed not only that the participants have experienced learning loss and lack of motivation, but also that the pre-existing educational and social inequities seemed exacerbated and amplified during ERT and the COVID-19 crisis. Issues in terms of accessibility, digital divide, inequity, and mental/emotional/physical health that the participants, more likely females, experienced during emergency remote learning were especially concerning. The results highlighted the importance of addressing and combating the inequities, creating and maintaining a sense of community, and most significantly providing socio-emotional support, 'TLC' (Tender Loving Care; TLC (Tender Loving Care) is an expression, describing extra attention to make someone or something look or feel better), and compassion, to college students and the instructors during the uncertain times and as we move forward.

        "Adults perceive the world using existing knowledge and experience (Gregory, 1970). However, adults may then impose their perspectives onto their children, whilst failing to understand the world through their child's eyes (Christakis, 2017). This qualitative study provides an exploratory insight into the perspectives of 19 children, aged 7-11 years, during the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic lockdown in the UK, when national restrictions on movement and online learning for all children were mandatory. Over a 10-day period, parents asked their children four short open questions at the end of each day: 1) 'What was the best thing that happened today?', 2) 'What was your least favourite part of today?', 3) 'What did you learn today that you didn't know yesterday?', and 4) 'What made you smile or laugh today?' Parents were specifically asked to make no mention of lockdown or school or virus (Covid-19). Thematic analysis revealed the importance of technology (both for online lessons, social communication, and recreation), proximity to family (parents and siblings), time with pets, and joint pastimes (walking, cooking, creative arts). This study provides insight into the world in which children were living and coping with the challenges of a lockdown during a national crisis and provides alternative methods for obtaining and evaluating qualitative data within a population of young children.

        "In their prior research on adaptive instruction for multi‐representational learning, the researchers explored various perspectives on designing visual representations and scaffolds. However, controversies and discrepancies regarding the fidelity of visual representations and self‐explanation prompts have yet to be resolved. This research thus examines types of visual representations and self‐explanation prompts and thereby suggests instructional strategies for multi‐representational adaptive learning. Sixty‐nine college students participated in a 2 × 2 between‐subjects study design (schematic only and adaptively increasing the fidelity of visual representation as well as fixed and fading self‐explanation prompts). Adaptively increasing visual fidelity was shown to be effective for mental model construction. Knowledge inference was most enhanced in the group utilising both adaptive approaches. The increased germane cognitive load appears to have mediated, in particular, the effects of visually adaptive instruction. This research suggests that visually adaptive instruction should include customized self‐explanation supports to ensure successful multi‐representational adaptive learning. This research reveals that sequencing visual representations with increasing fidelity as learning progress in instructional materials and offering fading support for prompts tailored to learning progress are the two effective and complementary ways to ensure customized learning. Lay Description: What is already known about this topic: Various perspectives on designing visual representations and scaffolds have been taken into consideration to construct optimal adaptive instruction for multi‐representational learning: the varying degree of visual representation fidelity (i.e., schematic up to realistic) and the level of support for self‐explanation (i.e., structured or less‐structured prompts). What this paper adds: Adaptively increasing the fidelity of the visual representations can enhance learners' pictorial constructions of mental models and promote knowledge inference.Fading scaffolding of self‐explanation prompts helps prevent the expertise reversal effect by averting any possible cognitive overload, and promote knowledge inference.Adaptive approach may influence the increase in the germane cognitive load to the most optimal degree to mediate the learning outcome. Implications for practice and/or policy: Sequencing visual representations with increasing fidelity as learning progress in textbooks and other instructional materials, whether analogue or digital, and offering fading support for prompts tailored to learning progress are the two effective and complementary ways to ensure customized learning.The results regarding the effects of visual representation fidelity and self‐explanation prompts can be used to guide the application of adaptive instructional algorithms in intelligent tutoring systems.

        "This article explores how the digital strategy for schools policy 2015–2020, Ireland's national digital technology in education policy and its enactment in schools prepared them for school closures as part of the Covid-19 response. The educational, economic and social context in which the digital strategy for schools was published in 2015 was vastly different from the current living with Covid-19 context. When schools eventually recalibrate, lockdown induced school closures will have provided a collective perspective and richer evidence base for the triumvirate of student, teacher and parent to contribute to the technology in the education debate. This paper utilises Ball, Maguire, and Braun's concept of context as a heuristic tool to illuminate the enactment of the Digital Strategy for Schools 2015–2020. The approach taken is discursive drawing on the digital strategy for schools policy document and the corpus of national and international reports and literature that have been published during Covid-19. Findings are fused with a detailed theoretical discussion about what we understand by digital learning for a post-pandemic society, how the current digital strategy speaks to this new reality and where attention should be directed in future reviews and strategy documents.

        "Recently, the education system has faced an unprecedented health crisis that has shaken up its foundation. Given today's uncertainties, it is vital to gain a nuanced understanding of students' online learning experience in times of the COVID-19 pandemic. Although many studies have investigated this area, limited information is available regarding the challenges and the specific strategies that students employ to overcome them. Thus, this study attempts to fill in the void. Using a mixed-methods approach, the findings revealed that the online learning challenges of college students varied in terms of type and extent. Their greatest challenge was linked to their learning environment at home, while their least challenge was technological literacy and competency. The findings further revealed that the COVID-19 pandemic had the greatest impact on the quality of the learning experience and students' mental health. In terms of strategies employed by students, the most frequently used were resource management and utilization, help-seeking, technical aptitude enhancement, time management, and learning environment control. Implications for classroom practice, policy-making, and future research are discussed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "The process of teaching and learning handwriting is complex and laborious. A digital learning environment in the form of a tablet app could enhance teachers' knowledge of writer characteristics and their management of classroom diversity. This study aims to identify the needs of cursive writing teachers from a survey of 164 kindergarten teachers in France teaching writing skills for children aged 5 to 6 years. The results provide insights into teacher needs and, therefore, can be used to identify the acceptability criteria of a tool designed to scaffold the teaching of writing gestures. The results of needs analyses have been interpreted in the light of new scientific findings on reading and writing skills, and there is a discussion on the potential of such a digital learning environment for the classroom, particularly during the training and skills assessment phases. Questionnaire answers show that the teachers interviewed rarely use digital tools in the classroom and this prompts reflection on the value and meaning that preschool children give to the digital trace.

        "Schools, teaching, and learning environments have long been understood and idealised as places of care. Within feminist studies and Science and Technology Studies (STS), scholars have proposed a shift to include non-humans in what we propose to conceive as care arrangements. Drawing on Tronto's feminist ethics of care [1993. Moral Boundaries: A Political Argument for an Ethic of Care. Routledge], we investigate educational technologies as 'matters of care', facilitating and enabling different modes of care. We pay particular attention to the role that educational technologies assume in schools' care arrangements. The paper is based on a study of four school information systems in Germany. We identify how these systems can be conceived of as antagonists, intermediaries, recipients of care or means to receive care and critically reflect on how this allows us to imagine modes of care with technology in order to create good educational futures.

        "This study examined the dynamic and complex development of college students' engagement in an online English for academic purposes (EAP) course. The study adopted a case study design, collecting data from multiple sources such as class observations and student interviews. Data analysis revealed the learners' engagement profiles and patterns throughout the duration of the course, highlighting the interactions and transactions between learners and the learning environment. In this online learning environment, the behavioral, cognitive, emotional, and social dimensions of learner engagement underwent dynamic development through interactions between learners and contextual complexity. The features and developmental trajectories of learner engagement were influenced by a series of language, cultural, course, technical, and individual factors, such as full English instruction, cultural differences in educational philosophy, course mode, technical support, learners' language proficiency, and motivation. These findings shed light on learner engagement in an online EAP learning context and have the potential to enrich our understanding of the multifaceted, situated, and dynamic nature of engagement. The study has implications for language pedagogy, curriculum design, and program innovation in a globalized world. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "Using 13,584 observations of 4772 undergraduate students enrolled in 523 online classes offered synchronously at a research university in China, and using online-learning platform data and administrative data, this paper examines the impacts of class attendance on academic performance. Based on student-level and course-level fixed effects models with a unique set of student-course level control variables, this paper finds class attendance to have a significantly positive impact on academic performance. This effect is larger for low-performing students and smaller for students in courses with larger class sizes. The above findings survive a number of robustness checks, including a bounding technique, restricting sample to compulsory courses and limiting variation in attendance caused by whole day absence. • This paper represents the first attempt to examine the effects of class attendance on academic performance of college students in synchronous online courses. • Based on 13584 observations of 4772 students enrolled in 523 online classes at a research university in China, this paper uses a larger sample with a diverse range of courses and more accurate indicators of class attendance. • Employing student and course fixed effects, we find that students' class attendance has a significantly positive impact on their academic performance. For a one standard deviation increase in class attendance, academic performance increases by 0.08 standard deviation. • The positive attendance effect is stronger for lower-performing students and students in smaller classes, and remains substantial even for courses without mandatory attendance requirements.

        "Health Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the potential to improve health care, but at the same time, raises many ethical challenges. Within the field of health AI ethics, the solutions to the questions posed by ethical issues such as informed consent, bias, safety, transparency, patient privacy, and allocation are complex and difficult to navigate. The increasing amount of data, market forces, and changing landscape of health care suggest that medical students may be faced with a workplace in which understanding how to safely and effectively interact with health AIs will be essential. Here we argue that there is a need to teach health AI ethics in medical schools. Real events in health AI already pose ethical challenges to the medical community. We discuss key ethical issues requiring medical school education and suggest that case studies based on recent real-life examples are useful tools to teach the ethical issues raised by health AIs.

        "Spaced education is a learning strategy to improve knowledge acquisition and retention. To date, no robust evidence exists to support the utility of spaced education in the Family Medicine residency. We aimed to test whether alerts to encourage spaced education can improve clinical knowledge as measured by scores on the Canadian Family Medicine certification examination. Method: We conducted a cluster randomized controlled trial to empirically and pragmatically test spaced education using two versions of the Family Medicine Study Guide mobile app. 12 residency training programs in Canada agreed to participate. At six intervention sites, we consented 335 of the 654 (51%) eligible residents. Residents in the intervention group were sent alerts through the app to encourage the answering of questions linked to clinical cases. At six control sites, 299 of 586 (51%) residents consented. Residents in the control group received the same app but with no alerts. Incidence rates of case completion between trial arms were compared using repeated measures analysis. We linked residents in both trial arms to their knowledge scores on the certification examination of the College of Family Physicians of Canada. Results: Over 67 weeks, there was no statistically significant difference in the completion of clinical cases by participants. The difference in mean exam scores and the associated confidence interval did not exceed the pre-defined limit of 4 percentage points. Conclusion: Further research is recommended before deploying spaced educational interventions in the Family Medicine residency to improve knowledge. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "As the world went suddenly into lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic, sending individuals to their homes and shutting businesses and institutions, the closing of schools posed big problems. The majority of the world's children were out of school, leading to the longest sustained period of school closures in history. We saw educators turning towards responses not aimed at collegial and community-engaged strategies for education in an emergency but at online learning cast as education/business as usual. This study explores the logic driving this global response through analyses of the documents released by three key global education actors: (1) the OECD and its paper A Framework to Guide Education Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic of 2020; (2) UNESCO's Global Education Coalition #LearningNeverStops; and (3) the World Bank's Guidance Note on Education Systems' Response to COVID-19; and Guidance Note: Remote Learning and COVID-19. The authors of this article draw on Carol Bacchi's approach to poststructural policy analysis to make visible the key concepts and binaries used within policy texts and to understand the \"technologies of saving\" that were invoked in each policy response, locating the education programmes, activities and actors within knowledge practices in educational reform. This article explores the World Bank, OECD and UNESCO responses using an analysis of knowledge harmonisation and difference among these institutions as well as their location as key norm-setters and governing actors in the field of education. The authors argue that all three responses privilege private-sector providers of digital technology. The consequence of these responses is that technologies of saving have centred on privatised, corporate edu-business and edu-tech aimed at online education delivery, bringing significant risks for the erasure of local knowledges. The authors' study suggests that local policymakers, including community-based and national actors, must be invited into the discussion to envision other possibilities and to name the potential destructiveness embedded in the international organisations' actions.

        "Résumé: Que sauvons-nous ? Sur la piste du savoir dominant et du discours de vérité dans les réponses politiques mondiales à la COVID-19 – Quand le monde s'est brusquement confiné à cause de la COVID-19, renvoyant les gens chez eux et fermant entreprises et institutions, la fermeture des écoles a posé de gros problèmes. La majeure partie des enfants dans le monde se sont retrouvés hors des établissements scolaires, ce qui s'est traduit par la plus longue période de fermeture des écoles de toute l'histoire. Nous avons vu des pédagogues se tourner vers des réponses qui ne visaient pas à trouver des stratégies éducatives collégiale et axées sur la communauté dans une situation d'urgence mais à simplement adopter une forme d'apprentissage en ligne pour continuer d'enseigner comme d'habitude. Cette étude se penche sur la logique qui sous-tend cette réponse globale en analysant les documents publiés par trois acteurs clés de l'éducation : (1) Un cadre pour guider une réponse éducative à la Covid-19 en cas de pandémie de 2020 de l'OCDE; (2) la Coalition mondiale pour l'éducation #ContinuitePedagogique de l'UNESCO et (3) deux notes d'orientation de la Banque mondiale : Note d'orientation sur la riposte des systèmes éducatifs au COVID19 et Note d'orientation mise à jour:Apprentissage à distance et COVID-19. Les auteures de cet article s'inspirent de l'approche analytique de la politique poststructurelle de Carol Bacchi pour mettre en relief les concepts clés et les binaires utilisés dans les textes politiques, et pour comprendre les « technologies de l'économie » invoquées dans toutes les réponses politiques, situant les programmes, les activités et les acteurs de l'éducation dans des pratiques du savoir en réforme éducative. Cet article examine les réponses de la Banque mondiale, de l'OCDE et de l'UNESCO en recourant à une analyse de l'harmonisation du savoir et des différences au sein de ces organismes ainsi que leur position en tant que décideurs clés qui imposent des normes et acteurs déterminants dans le secteur de l'éducation. Les auteures affirment que les trois réponses privilégient les fournisseurs de technologie numérique du secteur privé. En conséquence, les technologies de l'économie se sont focalisées sur un entrepreneuriat et une technologie privatisés en vue de proposer des services éducatifs en ligne, ce qui met considérablement en danger les savoirs locaux risquant ainsi d'être effacés. L'étude des auteures indique que les politiques locaux, y compris les acteurs communautaires et nationaux, doivent être invités à prendre part au débat afin d'envisager d'autres possibilités et dénoncer le pouvoir destructeur potentiel que recèlent les actions des organisations internationales.

        "This study examines the influence of perceived social presence on online graduate students' value and expectancy beliefs. Forty‐nine participants enrolled in an online teacher leadership graduate program completed questionnaires that measured perceived social presence and value and expectancy beliefs. A series of simple linear regression analyses revealed that social presence positively predicted students' value for online learning. Social presence did not predict participants' expectations of future success in teacher leadership. Results partially supported the assumption of the expectancy‐value model that motivational beliefs are influenced by the information students receive from social partners. Moreover, the study tested and confirmed the application of the model in online settings and for students pursuing graduate education. Lay Description: What is already known about this topic: Value and expectancy motivational beliefs are influenced by perceptions of the classroom social climate.In online learning environments, social presence characterizes the classroom social climate.Existing studies mostly examine the social determinants of value and expectancy beliefs of children in K‐12 face‐to‐face educational settings.The role of social presence in shaping value and expectancy beliefs in fully online graduate programs needs more empirical attention. What this paper adds: A study that examined the impact of social presence on value and expectancy beliefs of online students pursuing graduate education.Social presence predicts value beliefs in online graduate students.Social presence is a social determinant of motivational beliefs. Implications for practice and/or policy: Promotes more careful attention to social presence and motivation in online graduate programs.Identifies social presence as a legitimate social precursor to value and expectancy beliefs.Broadens the scope of research on social determinants of motivational beliefs.

        "Rational number and fractions concepts are inherently difficult; and lack of mastery often holds students back from success in subsequent mathematics courses. This paper describes design characteristics of a software based, adaptive, rational number tutor with virtual manipulatives, realistic contexts, and procedural feedback. Then, the paper presents findings from a randomized crossover trial designed to evaluate the impact of the described intervention on student fraction achievement. The trial was conducted in two districts in two states with 17 elementary school teachers and 297 4th and 5th grade students. Half of the participating classrooms replaced worksheet practice time (over 10 instructional hours) with Woot Math Adaptive Learning (WMAL), a digital tutor that incorporates dynamic digital manipulatives, video tutorials and automatic feedback to students and teachers. After 10 instructional hours the groups switched conditions for another 10 instructional hours so each student would have exposure to the treatment and control conditions. Analysis shows that regardless of treatment order, student performance gains on assessment items (mostly from NAEP and TIMMS) were statistically higher, (d = 0.39, F(1,589) = 5.73, p < 0.05), after 10 days of instruction with WMAL than they were after 10 days of business‐as‐usual instruction. This difference of 0.39 standard units corresponds to an improvement index of 10.9 (percentile point gain compared to non‐treatment). The results demonstrate how the described approach to software and instructional design can work together to support significant increases in student achievement in rational number domains by combining best practices in feedback, curricular design, and adaptive instructional sequences. Practitioner notesWhat is already known about this topic?Fraction difficulties are common and compound into greater math difficulties and math anxiety.Best practices for teaching fractions include the use of manipulatives and a focus on conceptual understanding. Feedback should focus on both the process of learning and the products that students produce.Adaptive software systems have the potential to support student practice but there are limited studies in authentic classroom environments with comparable control groups.Other adaptive systems have not implemented best practices in adaptability, design for feedback and curricular design.What this paper adds?Describes a software‐based intervention designed with best practices in curricular design for student development of conceptual understanding of fractions.Describes adaptive features of the software intervention for pacing and automated feedback on both student responses and their work.Reports on a randomised crossover study to evaluate the effectiveness of this intervention as compared to business‐as‐usual instructional methods for student practice time.Implications for practice and/or policy?Provides evidence to support curricular materials that use manipulatives and are designed to promote conceptual understanding in addition to procedural fluency.Describes how technology can efficiently scale best practices and support teachers in helping students make sense of fractions.Reports on how classroom technology can support and extend teaching through personalised learning and improved feedback used during independent practice time.

        "From March 2020, the Mathematics Support Centre at University College Dublin, Ireland, and the Mathematics Education Support Hub at Western Sydney University, Australia, moved wholly online and have largely remained so to the point of writing (August 2021). The dramatic and swift changes brought on by COVID-19, in particular to fully online modes of teaching and learning including mathematics and statistics support (MSS), have presented students and tutors with a host of new opportunities for thinking and working. This study aims to gain insight both from students and tutors about their experience of wholly online learning and tutoring in the COVID-19 era. In this sense, it represents a 'perspectives' study, the idea being that before we examine specific aspects of this experience, it would be best to know what the issues are. Employing a qualitative analysis framework of 23 one-on-one interview transcripts with tutors and students from both institutions in Australia and Ireland, we identified five key themes as central to the shared experiences and perspectives of tutors and students. In this study, we discuss three of these themes in relation to the new normal with the intention of supporting MSS practitioners, researchers and students going forward. The themes describe the usage of online support, how mathematics is different and the future of online MSS. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has required faculty and students to adapt to an unprecedented challenge and rapidly transition from traditional face-to-face instruction to distance learning formats through virtual classrooms. While most campuses trained faculty to ensure quality and maintenance of the curriculum through virtual classrooms, less consideration has been given to training students, who face equal challenges in adapting to this abrupt change in the delivery of the curriculum. Few approaches have been developed for students to facilitate their involuntary transition to virtual classrooms and maintenance of appropriate online learning behaviours and etiquette. Presented here are a series of propositions to help to maintain and enhance the quality of college student engagement and activity in the virtual classroom. These guidelines are from one example of the State University of New York public educational system perspective, at the pandemic's epicentre, while serving a diverse student population. Initiating a meaningful dialogue between faculty, who are engaged in efforts to cope and adapt to the pandemic, may prove useful in re-envisioning and re-designing future curriculum. This may facilitate future discussions on creating best practices guidelines for asynchronous/synchronous virtual classrooms post the pandemic. The present rapid communication suggests a framework for faculty to develop such guidelines to address the current gap in the literature. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "In the context of the nationwide shift to online learning due to the COVID-19 pandemic and its possible effect on mental health, this study investigated the relationship between demographic, gadget and Internet profiles, and disease and consequence related COVID-19 anxiety among Filipino college students. This is a quantitative cross-sectional study. A total of 952 students participated in the online survey. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used to draw insights from the data. Findings suggest that majority of the student respondents had high levels of disease and consequence related COVID-19 anxiety. Students from poorer households, who do not own laptops and desktop computers, and those with limited Internet connection exhibited higher levels of disease-related COVID-19 anxiety. Younger, poorer, female students who were enrolled in lower year levels, do not own laptops or tablets, and have limited or borrowed Internet connectivity demonstrated higher levels of consequence-related COVID-19 anxiety.

        "Project‐based learning (PjBL) engages students in knowledge acquisition, application, and construction through artefact development. Based on the Community of Inquiry framework, this study characterized college students' social and cognitive presences in online PjBL and examined how presence was related to their academic performance. Twenty‐four groups of students participated in a 3‐week project via WeChat discussion groups and created a final product. Transcripts of students' online discourse were collected and analysed by a coding scheme. The quality of students' artefacts was evaluated by a grading rubric. Descriptive results showed that the component of affectiveness and the level of exploration accounted for the majority of students' social and cognitive presences, respectively. Stepwise regression analyses revealed that certain components and sub‐components of students' social presence, and levels and sub‐levels of their cognitive presence were positively associated with their academic performance. Practical implications for teachers and suggestions for further research are provided. Lay Description: What is already known about this topic: Social and cognitive presences predict academic performance in non‐project‐based online learning. What this paper adds: Various components of social presence predict group artefact performance in online project‐based learning.Different levels of cognitive presence predict group artefact performance in online project‐based learning. Implications for practice and/or policy: Students should acquire basic content knowledge before participating in online project‐based discussions.Teachers might consider assisting students with the direction of online project‐based discussions.

        "Background: Exploring using constructivist learning has become a focus of educational research in recent years. However, no available research has been found which examines the contribution of constructivist learning through the implementation of handheld computers and tablets (in the literature, a constructivist mobile learning environment refers to constructivist learning with the implementation of mobile devices) to student knowledge across cognitive levels, while their opinion on that contribution in biological education in primary schools is as yet unreported. Purpose: The main aim of this research is to examine the contribution of the Dichotomous Mobile Key (DMK) and the Dichotomous Printed Key (DPK), implemented in the classroom through constructivist learning, to student achievement and the sustainability of the primary school students' biological knowledge about the Systematic and classification of plants at all cognitive levels. The research also analyses students' opinions about the applied dichotomous keys in the constructivist learning process and the correlation between student knowledge and their opinion about the application of the DMK or the DPK. Design and methods: This research uses a quasi-experimental design and involved 140 eight-grade students from Montenegro assigned to two experimental groups, learning through: 1) the DPK (Group C) and 2) the DMK (Group E). Results and conclusions: The results indicate that studying using a DMK is more suitable than a DPK for learning botany in primary schools when implementing a constructivist approach. This is because the DMK is better suited to enhancing some elements of certain constructivist approaches, notably eliciting students' prior knowledge; facilitating exploratory learning; creating cognitive dissonance; and receiving continuous feedback during the entire learning process. The contribution of the DMK is greater than that of the DPK to students' knowledge and opinions to the contribution of the applied dichotomous key to their knowledge and greater desire to learn about plants.

        "This article develops four school education scenarios to help educators consider the role of digital technologies in future teaching and to provoke discussion of how education might be done differently. The context for these scenarios is a world shaped by the COVID19 pandemic. The development of education scenarios is a useful device for thinking about the future and is often used as a methodology to stimulate discussion about possible variations in education. We use our empirical data from a recent study of Australian schools illustrating exemplary remote-teaching, to generate four alternative scenarios for future school education, with a particular focus on learning agency, and the level of educational technology use. We show how different contexts and different student needs are supported by each of the four scenarios. This set of scenarios challenges the common perception that remote learning is only effective through high end use of online technologies, and suggests there is a role for both student-led and teacher-led approaches, depending on the particular contexts. The article discusses the place of innovation in disadvantaged and technology-restricted contexts. It concludes with an analysis of the ways in which school education might respond to future challenges and opportunities. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "Background: In 2018, it was found that only a quarter of Grade 3 children in India were reading at grade level. A growing demand for English education has further limited children's literacy achievement. Despite a strong evidence base in favour of using systematic phonics for building English literacy skills, many teachers in India continue to use rote‐methods of literacy instruction. Objectives: We aimed to examine the efficacy of GraphoLearn (GL) English Rime, a computer‐assisted reading intervention, in improving the foundational literacy skills of 1st and 2nd grade students who were attending an English medium school in India. Methods: A total of 136 students across 6 classrooms were randomly allocated to play either GL or a control math game over a 5‐week intervention period. Students were pre‐ and post‐tested on various English literacy skills using tasks built into the GL software as well as through oral and paper‐based tasks. Results and Conclusions: Students who played GL showed significantly greater and faster development on in‐game measures of letter‐sound knowledge, rime unit recognition, and word recognition as compared to students who did not play GL. In addition, GL resulted in greater effects on these measures for students with stronger English literacy skills prior to the start of the intervention. No differences were found between groups on the oral and paper‐based tasks. Implications: GL was able to quickly and effectively teach critical sub‐skills for reading. However, a lack of effects on the out‐of‐game measures opens the door for further discussion on the successful implementation of such interventions. Lay Description: What is already known about this topic:India has an ongoing literacy crisis with many children failing to acquire functional literacy skills.Under‐resourced schools,outdated pedagogical methods, and a demand for English‐medium education are partially to blame.Globally, technology is being increasingly looked at to help improve student learning levels across all subject areas.There are a lack of studies examining the efficacy of various ed‐tech tools to improve literacy in the context of India.What this paper adds:The study aimed to test GraphoLearn English (GL), a mobile game designed to teach and practice early reading skills through phonics with first and second graders.Results showed that children who played GL outperformed those who did not play on critical literacy skills such as letter‐sound knowledge and word recognition.In addition, GL was more effective for those who had higher pre‐existing English literacy skills.However, improvements were only seen on measures assessed in the game and not on measures assessed orally or on paper.Implications for practice and/or policy:GL and other educational technologies can be extremely effective tools which allow for an individualized learning experience.However, it is important that for any educational game, learning moves beyond the game itself.Teachers are critical players in this process and must ensure that tech‐based instruction is integrated with teacher‐led instruction.Policy makers and school administration must ensure that teachers are adequately trained on when, with whom, and how to use such technologies before they are introduced.

        "With the support of various personal and institutional mobile technologies, numerous physical and virtual spaces can be turned into interesting and motivating hybrid learning settings. By its nature, outdoor mobile learning happens on the move is connected to specific locations and settings inviting learners to study their surroundings, inquire about natural phenomena and solve complex real‐life problems. This poses challenges for teachers to design meaningful, contextualized and comprehensive learning experiences. The paper aims to explore what kind of mobile learning scenarios K‐12 teachers create and what are the limitations and development perspectives of these scenarios. Content analysis of 25 location‐based outdoor learning tracks with 465 questions and tasks was carried out. The results demonstrate that designing and implementing learning activities outside the safe, familiar classroom environment in new hybrid learning spaces is a challenging task for the teachers on many different levels. Taking Bloom's revised taxonomy, types of contextualization and integrated learning models as frameworks for content analysis of the learning scenarios, the study shows that the teachers do not perceive the potential hybrid spaces and mobile technologies offer in order to design consistent learning experiences that emphasize higher order thinking levels, encompass contextual information and integrate knowledge from multiple disciplinary sources. The paper concludes that there is a need for more teacher training and systemic interventions into current teaching practices that encourage teachers to step outside of their existing teaching paradigms to acknowledge the pedagogical potential of hybrid learning spaces as well as the technological affordances.

        "In recent years, tertiary institutions have engaged more with digital education, especially blended and online learning. One institution sought to transform its existing provision, and enhance learning and teaching, through a substantial strategic funding initiative comprising almost 20 individual projects. To capture the learning from this substantial investment, 20 semi-structured interviews were carried out with staff involved in setting up or working on these projects, typically early adopters. Interviews sought to revisit motivations to engage with the project, and capture perceived benefits including lessons learned, challenges, enablers, support needs and recommendations going forwards. Participants were motivated to enhance their own teaching practice and improve student learning experience/outcomes. Recognised benefits included enhanced learner experience, transformed teaching practice, flexibility and access, teaching efficiencies, and developmental opportunities for staff. Significant challenges related to the time required to design, develop and implement courses, as well as technological and student-related issues. Despite these challenges, participation in the project led to the development of new skills and transformed teachers' learning and teaching practice. This was made possible through a number of enablers including prior experience of blended learning, and supportive others from across various services, schools and colleges. The study highlights the importance of strategic projects in expanding the digital capabilities of an institution to meet the expected--and unexpected--demands of the future. The findings are discussed in the context of the current literature on blended and remote learning, and existing institutional frameworks that support transitions to blended learning.

        "While response time and accuracy indicate overall performance, their value in uncovering cognitive processes, underlying learning, is limited. A promising online measure, designed to track decision‐making, is computer mouse tracking, where mouse attraction towards different locations may reflect the consideration of alternative response options. Using a speedy arithmetic multiple‐choice game in an online adaptive learning environment, we examined whether mouse movements could reflect arithmetic difficulties when error rates are low. Results showed that mouse movements towards alternative responses in correctly answered questions mapped onto the frequency of errors made in this online learning system. This mapping was stronger for the younger children, as well as for easy arithmetic problems. On an individual level, users showed more mouse movement towards their previously made response errors than towards other alternative options. This opens the possibility of adapting feedback and instruction on an individual basis through mouse tracking. Lay Description: What is currently known about this topic: In online learning environments, detecting systematic difficulties for students during learning is challenging due to the required high success rate.Previous studies have found that computer mouse tracking offers a window into the cognitive process of considering multiple alternatives before deciding.What is lacking is a validation outside the lab, whether mouse tracking can be a source for detecting systematic difficulties students might have. What the paper adds to this: Mouse tracking was implemented outside the lab in a large‐scale online learning environment for primary school children practicing maths.Novel mouse metrics were developed to measure attraction towards multiple distractors instead of one.Findings show that mouse movements reveal cues to arithmetic difficulties without the need for errors. Implications of the study findings: Mouse tracking is a useful tool to investigate difficulties in the learning process in a motivating practice system.Diagnosing these arithmetic misconceptions for individuals can help to adapt feedback and instruction.The developed mouse method can be used for more daily‐life complex designs with multiple attractors.

        "During school closures prompted by the Covid-19 pandemic, educational technology (EdTech) was often used to continue educational provision. In this article, we consider EdTech effectiveness using a holistic framework, and synthesise findings from 10 primary research studies of EdTech interventions conducted in low- and middle-income countries during the pandemic. The framework includes five main lenses: learning outcomes, enhancing equity, implementation context, cost and affordability, and alignment and scale. While in-person schooling has largely resumed, there continues to be further integration of EdTech into education systems globally. This analysis provides evidence-based insights and highlights knowledge gaps to shape holistic analysis of both EdTech mainstreaming and future research into the effective use of EdTech to strengthen learning. • Educational technology (EdTech) was used around the globe in response to school closures caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. • In this paper, we analyse EdTech effectiveness across 10 empirical studies undertaken in low- and middle-income countries. • The analysis considers 'effectiveness' holistically through five main lenses: learning, equity, context, cost, and scale. • The findings provide insight on good practice in EdTech implementation as its use continues to grow post-pandemic.

        "Gamified learning tools refer to the websites, software or mobile applications that use game design elements for educational purposes. Though theoretically promising in engaging leaners, gamified learning tools were not widely accepted in practice. This paper seeks to better understand what encourages and constrains teachers' use of gamified learning tools in secondary schools in China in order to better realise the potential of gamification in formal learning contexts. The research comprises a survey and an interview that involves 347 and 14 secondary school teachers respectively, who were recruited with the use of convenience sampling method. Using the thematic analysis approach, the author obtained 16 themes that influence teachers' acceptance intention to gamification, followed by a list of sub-themes that furtherly explain the themes. Research limitations, implications and future research lines were addressed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "Recent developments in educational technology have led to a renewed interest in the utilisation of user-generated microgames for facilitating learning. The advantages and disadvantages of microgames which have been voluntarily created, modified, shared and used by users on open learning platforms to support learning are not yet clearly understood. The present study explores the strengths and weaknesses of user-generated microgames for assisting learning followed with some recommendations for the development and effective use of microgames from elementary teacher perspectives. This study is exploratory research conducted within the GeoGebra application with the participation of elementary school teachers from Indonesia. The study found that, on the one hand, user-generated microgames have multiple advantages to support learning mainly by their simplicity and short duration gameplay. On the other hand, the games have several disadvantages, especially due to the lack of content directly related to learning objectives and less interesting interfaces. It is recommended for users of open learning platforms to create more targeted microgames respecting a particular learning objective and for teachers to creatively connect games to learning for mastering knowledge, skills, or literacies.

        "Do generative learning strategies influence the motivational and affective factors of learning with augmented reality? This article explores this highly topical new question in the field of research on educational technology and reports the results of a value-added study that compares two mobile AR learning environments with or without additional learning strategies. A total of 56 primary school students participated and learned with augmented reality (AR) learning materials either in an experimental group or a control group. The experimental group learned with AR and additional learning strategies based on generative learning theory, namely, self-explanation and self-testing. The control group learned only with AR. It was investigated whether the addition of learning strategies would lead to a reduction in positive attitudes towards AR as a learning technology. The experimental group of students showed overall positive attitudes towards AR as a learning technology at approximately the same level as the control group. However, significant differences were found for the skepticism subscale, indicating that learners who learned with both AR and learning strategies were more skeptical about AR as a learning technology than those who learned only with AR. Gender differences were also found for the accessibility subscale, with male participants considering the AR technology to be easier to access outside of the classroom too. The impact of these results on theory and practice as well as further research directions is discussed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "The number of students accessing Alternative Provision (AP) in the UK is growing and the ways in which such provision is facilitated is evolving with the use of EdTech. However, there is very little evidence of such provisions being evaluated in terms of their educational impact nor regarding the way in which students engage with them. This results in the voices of students participating in AP being further marginalised by being out of mainstream education, as they fail to be heard by their educators, schools or local authorities. Within this exploratory paper digital data collection methods are shown to offer a solution to this problem and reveal student voice insights into how they engage with and experience one specific form of synchronistic online AP. This study provides evidence of how student voice can effectively be collated in order to provide an opportunity for marginalised student voices to be heard. Practitioner NotesWhat is already known about this topic Student voice is a critical tool in both engaging students and student engagement.There is a preference in students to give anonymous feedback and this facilitates more honest, open responses.AP uptake is increasing.There has been little evidence of any effort to obtain student voice from students in AP.What this paper adds Gathering student voice from students in AP is critical to assess how students view and respond to their provision.Digital data collection facilitates AP student voice; students both younger and potentially more vulnerable to disengagement can have their voices heard more easily.A substantial majority of students in AP who have left mainstream education perceive online learning delivery methods to have positive impacts.Implications for practice/pedagogy Practitioners should strive to ensure AP students have avenues through which they may have their student voices heard to gain insights into the effectiveness of the provision from a student perspective.Anonymous feedback, which enables students to be confident in expressing their views, even when verbally expressed, can be facilitated through digital data collection methods.Use of live, online interactive lessons are a valuable form of AP worthy of further exploration.

        "Background: Augmented reality (AR) has been incorporated in context‐aware ubiquitous learning (CAUL) designs to guide learners but few of the designs adopt specific learning theories. Furthermore, there are no CAUL design models that align learning theories to CAUL effectiveness. In addition, CAUL review papers have not documented CAUL developments since AR technology has become normalized. Objectives: A phenomenological research method with expert design input was adopted to build theoretically informed CAUL design models and provide guidelines for AR‐driven CAUL. Methods: The researchers reviewed 38 empirical AR studies in education from 2016 to 2019 in seven high‐impact journals of educational technology using a taxonomy based on CAUL learning theories. Seven domain experts reviewed the findings and provided insights into current developments, patterns of variables, and the proposed AR‐guided CAUL model. The expert feedback was used to refine the CAUL models. Results and conclusions: Research into humanity‐related subjects are growing due to the features of AR, and the majority of studies were in primary education as AR corresponds well with lower‐level cognitive learning tasks. Many AR functions cooccurred with situated learning theory, inquiry‐based learning theory, and collaborative learning theory. A macro‐design model and three micro‐design models of AR‐guided CAUL with specific learning theories was proposed. Major takeaways This study offers a set of AR‐guided CAUL design models aligned with established learning theories. The variables in the CAUL studies are linked with learning theories to clearly show how AR guides learning. The models can guide instructors to meet their students' needs. Lay Description: What is already known about this topic?: Computer assisted ubiquitous learning (CAUL) can assist learners in developing various skills and knowledge.Augmented reality (AR) has been widely incorporated in context‐aware ubiquitous learning (CAUL) designs to enrich and guide learners.Lower‐level cognitive developments are research‐proven features of AR‐based systems. What this paper adds?: This paper offers a set of AR‐guided learning design modes aligned with learning theories.Humanity‐related subjects like English and history are growing due to the features of AR.Three stages of context‐aware ubiquitous learning were found: tag‐searching, image‐tracking, and panorama‐recognizing. Implications for practice and/or policy: The proposed model provides variables and patterns of the variables with learning theories to guide users.This paper can inform researchers on the potential of learning theories to guide learning designs, help instructional designers revise curricula, and help teachers by highlighting effective learning strategies to guide learners with AR.

        "Social Work's Grand Challenge to Harness Technology for Social Good calls for educators to reevaluate their role and its significance for the future of social work. Information and communication technology (ICT)-mediated practice methods like artificial intelligence, virtual reality, gamification, and big data, among others, represent a new arena for social work practice. However, educators have been mostly inactive in developing curricula that support student knowledge, training, and decision-making on the adoption of technology for practice. In the United States, the Council on Social Work Education Futures Task Force highlighted this inaction as a matter of critical uncertainty for the field's future. In contrast, this paper describes how a school of social work rapidly deployed a free, CE training program on the basics of telebehavioral health practice to the social work community to aid their response to COVID-19. The rapid deployment of that training has been distilled as 'lessons learned' for those wanting to join in efforts to address the field's critical uncertainty regarding the adoption of technology. Information is presented about the reach of this training and includes feedback from participants. Additionally, the authors discuss whether COVID-19 can influence social work's future rate of technology adoption. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "This study is a systematic review of 20 years of research on the usage of virtual reality (VR) in K‐12 and higher education settings, which aims to consolidate, evaluate, and communicate evidence that can inform both the theory and practice of VR‐based instruction. A total of 149 articles were selected from three major academic databases using search strings and manual screening protocols. The literature analysis emphasized four interrelated aspects of VR‐based instruction: instructional context, instructional design, technological affordances, and research findings. The results revealed evolving trends in the VR literature in terms of publication patterns, pedagogical assumptions, equipment usage, and research methodologies, as well as the contextual factors behind VR adoption in education. Additionally, a meta‐analysis was conducted to examine the efficacy of VR‐based instruction, with results indicating an overall medium effect and several moderating factors. Finally, practical implications and a future research agenda for VR‐based instruction are discussed. Lay Description: What is currently known about the subject matter: VR is a promising educational technology with several learning benefits.Research findings on VR‐based education have been conditional and inconclusive.Contemporary research on VR in K‐12 and higher education settings lacks a comprehensive review and meta‐analysis. What this paper adds: This paper systematically reviewed 20 years of empirical research on VR application in K‐12 and higher education.This paper revealed evolving trends in the VR literature in terms of publication patterns, pedagogical assumptions, and equipment usage.This paper synthesised the key pedagogical and technological features of VR interventions.This paper reported an overall medium effect size of VR‐based instruction and several moderating factors. Implications of this study for practitioners: Decision to adopt VR technology should be based on the careful assessment of learning domains and tasks.Embedded functions for learning assessment, collaboration, and data collection are recommended for future VR interventions.Research in VR is needed with focus on advanced technology, cross‐disciplinary comparison, holistic instructional process, and cost‐benefit analysis.

        "Music education technology continues to open significant possibilities for composing, improvisation and other creative music-making activities in school classrooms. However, these possibilities are not always fully realized in the everyday life of the school, often due to limitations in teachers' digital competencies. This article aims to examine the conditions necessary to facilitate continuing education that best supports teachers' professional development in digital technology-supported classroom composition. By analysing the data material collected during a development project Future Songwriting (2018–20), this case study examines how professional development in music education technology was enhanced or constrained by the project. Future Songwriting was a European cooperation project, co-funded by the European Commission under the Creative Europe programme along with seven consortium partners and designed to provide teachers in three European countries (Finland, France and Germany) with hands-on training to upgrade their skills and knowledge related to the use of music education technology. This article focuses on the activities that took place in Finland (five schools) and Germany (five schools) from March 2019 to October 2020. Although many elements in the project promoted the participating teachers' skill development and knowledge acquisition, opportunities for the teachers to engage in critical reflection to develop capacity in learning to learn in digital environments were limited. The article discusses the possibilities of continuing education projects for enhancing teachers' digital identities. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "The Covid-19 pandemic forced many American schools to hastily transition to online learning. I assess how the online learning experience of students enrolled in brick and mortar schools that transitioned to online learning in Spring 2020 compared to the experience of students who were already enrolled in virtual schools when the pandemic began. Absent formal assessments to quantify learning loss, such comparison can help contextualize the performance of brick and mortar schools in their transition to online learning, and perhaps inform how policy can promote higher-quality online schooling, a burgeoning policy concern amidst widespread school closures forecasted for the 2020–2021 academic year. I hypothesize that, owing to experience and expertise, virtual schools provided a higher quality education than did brick and mortar schools operating online. I test this hypothesize by administering surveys to parents of students enrolled in online schools. When applicable, parents also complete a survey about the online learning experience of siblings enrolled in brick and mortar schools that switched to online learning in Spring 2020. I compare survey outcomes across four constructs: active learning, communication, pedagogical efficacy, and classroom management. Overall, I observe that virtual schools earned substantially higher marks across the four constructs. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "The rise in online courses and virtual learning avenues in the last few decades, and more recently the Covid-19 pandemic has seen traditional design schools imparting learning seamlessly by transitioning to the virtual realm partially or completely. This study helps understand the perspective of students from various design schools across India regarding their learning experience in online courses, virtual classrooms and their perceived social connectedness with peers and educators. We report findings from a mixed-methods study, which combined both quantitative and qualitative data collection and analysis, wherein ninetyfive students from five design schools across India responded anonymously to the online questionnaire survey. We assessed the factors that impacted perceived social connectedness of the students with their educators and peers in online classes. We also discuss some of the reasons for this perception, as articulated by the participants, and report a significant correlation found between felt connectedness and various factors in online learning, such as visibility of participants, level of interaction during class, interest in course and understanding of the subject. It was observed that while the target student group seemed adept in online interaction and exchange of information, their feedback on online learning revealed unique insights into aspects that affect overall experience of design education. In addition, we submit some of the features or elements of traditional face-to-face (F2F) classrooms that students miss the most in the current online setting and some of the measures taken by students and educators to stay connected and overcome the virtual gap in learning.

        "During the pandemic many museums and galleries pivoted from onsite, in‐person delivery to develop a remote offer and to create digital learning resources and activity packs for children and young people. In this article, I draw upon my experience as practitioner researcher on the schools and teachers' programme at the Fitzwilliam Museum to consider different approaches to supporting participatory creative pedagogies while the museum was closed. After discussing how the work built on and extended existing programming for this audience, I consider effective strategies for facilitating authentic and inclusive encounters with objects and artworks remotely. While some were empowered to take part and to engage, others were locked out through the ever widening social and digital divide. How can we overcome these challenges and make the most of the opportunities which this work has revealed? What are the implications of this work for our understanding of the role, function and future of museum and gallery learning? [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "The COVID-19 pandemic has confronted mathematics teachers with the challenge of developing alternative teaching practices—in many cases at a distance through digital technology—because schools were closed. To investigate what distance practices in secondary mathematics education have emerged and how teachers experienced them, we set out online questionnaires in Flanders—the Dutch-speaking part of Belgium—, Germany, and the Netherlands. The questionnaire focused on teaching practices, teacher beliefs, didactics, and assessment. Data consisted of completed questionnaires by 1719 mathematics teachers. Results show that the use of video conferencing tools increased massively, while the use of mathematics-specific tools that teachers used before the lockdown reduced substantially. Further findings are that teachers' confidence in using digital technologies increased remarkably during the lockdown and that their experiences and beliefs only marginally impacted their distance learning practices. Also, we observed some differences between the three countries that might be explained by differences in educational policies and in technological facilities and support. For future research, it would be relevant to investigate long-term changes in teachers' practices, as well as students' views and experiences related to the teacher's practices.

        "Student engagement in online learning enhance students performance and the outcomes of the learning process in online learning environment. The existed literature revealed various factors influencing student engagement in online leaning, however these studies were before the COVID-19 crisis. The purpose of the current paper is to explore the factors that influence student engagement in online learning during the COVID-19 crisis in middle school settings in developing countries where is a lack of studies about the factors influencing student's engagement in emergency remote learning during the crisis. A qualitative approach was used for data collection and analysis. Semi-structured interviews with 34 participants (14 students, 13 teachers, and 7 parents) were conducted for 20–30 min. Furthermore, online class observations were used for data collection; 13 online classes were observed. Each class was 40 min. A thematic analysis was used to categorize the findings into themes and subthemes. The findings of the study revealed that various factors influence student engagement in online learning during the crisis including infrastructure factors, cultural factors, digital inequality, and the threat to digital privacy. Cultural factors were the important factor that influences females because of parents' culture and their bias against females using online learning compared to male students. Teachers' presence and quality of content were the major factors that influence student engagement, where parental concerns, norms, and traditions emerged as the major factors in the crisis, influencing engagement. Most of the participants reported that teaching and learning online during the crisis has broadened the digital inequality and threatened their digital privacy which influenced negatively student engagement. The limitations of this research included the limited number of participants covering a large geographic area, and the research design using diverse and often limited educational software and delivery methods. Future studies could utilize a mixed-method approach and include more participants. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "Health and safety concerns during the COVID-19 pandemic required many face-to-face United States schools to suddenly shut their doors, moving classes to virtual learning environments. Amidst concerns of technology overuse, adolescents across the country saw dramatic increases in both personal screen time use and social isolation as they learned to navigate online schooling. Understanding the impact of the pandemic-related shutdowns upon adolescent well-being, learning, and social life is critical for designing effective online learning experiences, but research provides few insights from the adolescent perspective. This mixed methods study works to fill this gap by investigating adolescent needs and perceptions during the pandemic. The main questions asked are: To what extent does adolescent well-being during the pandemic differ from pre-pandemic well-being? What factors do adolescents view as influences upon their learning during the imposed shift to online schooling? What social changes and concerns do adolescents report during the pandemic? Twenty-one adolescents completed Likert scale surveys and participated in semi-structured one-to-one interviews. Results showed a significant decrease in positive affect and a significant increase in negative affect during the pandemic, suggesting a decline in well-being. The majority of participants reported high distractibility and noted the lure of entertaining technology, but also described their smartphones as \"connecting\" and \"necessary\". Social interactions were a priority for all participants, but participants agreed that opportunities for social connectedness in online education were limited. The challenges of online learning, the importance of identifying and responding to student needs, and suggested strategies for online education are discussed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "Recently, the whole world has faced the deadliest and dangerous consequences due to the transmission of infectious novel coronavirus (nCov). With the outbreak of COVID-19, the education learners, practitioners, and other stakeholders were at the sake of a loss, as it causes the suspension of physical classes and physical interaction of the learners. In these circumstances, Electronic learning (E-learning), Online learning, and the use of Information and Communications Technology (ICT) tools came in handy. It helped the learners in the dissemination of ideas, conducting online classes, making online discussion forums, and taking online examinations. Like the government of each country, the Indian government was also caught off-guard but the existing E-learning infrastructure was able to leverage on while devising plans to tailor them to new situations and launching new ones. The initiatives at the forefront of this noble battle launched by the Department of School Education and Literacy, Ministry of Human Resources Development (MHRD) includes Diksha, Swayam Prabha Channel, Shiksha Van, E-Pathshala, and National Repository of Open Educational Resources (NROER). It worth noting that apart from the Indian central government efforts, each state has various online education initiatives that are tailored to their needs. This research evaluated each of these initiatives commenced by central and state governments and present a detailed analysis of most of the relevant initiatives. Additionally, a survey is conducted to get insights of learners in concern to online learning. Despite the issues raised in this learning, the outcomes come to be satisfactorily favoring online learning. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "There is evidence that sustainability and efficiency are challenges for mobile learning adoption methods. The objective of this study is to identify, categorize and evaluate the critical factors that shape the adoption and sustainable use of mobile learning.. The study will investigate the factors that affect mobile learning adoption, how they can be categorized and what is the prioritization of these categories in the context of Catalonia. The research in this study was designed according to a mixed methods paradigm applying a mixed research approach weighted toward quantitative data, including a literature review, a systematic review, and an expert judgement. A total of 361 factors were identified by reviewing 74 studies; twenty-six studies were included in the systematic review; and seven Catalan experts participated in the expert trial, including three school leaders, two university experts and two education inspectors. This study provides a taxonomy to categorize and orchestrate the factors affecting the adoption of mobile learning providing a holistic and coherent vision.. This categorization contributes to improving sustainability in the adoption of mobile learning. Overall, participants prioritize the five categories from the most challenging to the lowest impact as follows: leadership; personal character, attitudes, and ethics; digital literacy; pedagogical; and technological resources. The major limitation of this study is the lack of contextualization of the proposed categorization. Future research should offer different perspectives in order to generalize the results. Findings may vary with technological advances. The findings are expected to be useful both in academia and for school stakeholders as insights for further research and efficient and sustainable mobile learning adoptions. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "The use of digital technology to support teaching and learning in schools has been rising for years, but in March 2020, it became the only option when the Covid-19 pandemic resulted in the closure of almost all educational institutions worldwide. This article reports on a survey of secondary school leaders (n = 72) in Ireland, conducted three months after the closures. Leaders' beliefs about technology, digital practices before the pandemic and responses to the emergency are considered. The findings suggest that leaders are positively disposed towards technology, and that, prior to the crisis, approaches to digital learning were aligned with some best practice recommendations. Although schools endeavoured to continue provision during the closures, challenges were reported, particularly in rural schools and those serving disadvantaged cohorts. Leaders perceived teachers' 'digital competence' as an area in need of development, and noted that the pandemic may have provided an impetus for this. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "Student engagement in online courses may be more ambiguous, and complex to understand than in face-to-face (FtF) classrooms settings.

Science, 331, 1447–1451. doi: 10.1126/science.1198364) and a course's online learning climate (Kaufmann, Sellnow, & Frisby, 2016, The development and validation of the online learning climate scale (OLCS). Communication Education, 65, 307–321. doi: 10.1080/03634523.2015.1101778), as potential predictors of online student engagement. Results from hierarchical multiple regression models provide evidence of the predictive potential for these elements on online student engagement. Some possible evidence for the predictive potential of student GPA and age is provided as well. Implications of these findings, and future research opportunities are discussed.

        "This study aimed to assess the extent to which healthcare students use five informational technologies for daily academic purposes and to examine the changes in student perceptions toward these technologies over five years. This was a cross-sectional descriptive study in 10 different colleges in seven governorates. We conducted a survey using the instruments developed from the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). The surveys were administered to convenience samples of students at the colleges of pharmacy, medicine, and dentistry in the participating universities. The survey was conducted three times over three different years: 2015, 2018, 2020. Five Information and Communication Technology components were included in the study: electronic course management (ECM), internet, computer, audio recording/commentary, and PowerPoint slides. The surveys were electronic and administered using Qualtrics Survey Software. For most respondents, the survey links were administered electronically via Facebook groups to convenience samples of students of the Bachelor programs. Kruskal–Wallis test was used to measure the difference among the three (years) surveys results. The multiple linear regression analysis was used to measure the associations between the five predictors of the TAM and the outcome variable (actual use of technology). There was a total of 3,113 valid surveys collected in 2015, 2018, and 2020. Nearly two thirds of participants were females. Most students did not have enough experience in using ECM before classes closure in March 2020. Lack of facilitating conditions and infrastructures like an expert technical support team and stable internet connections are negatively impacting students' acceptance of technology use in education. Moving from mainly face-to-face learning with partial electronic use in 2015 and 2018 to totally virtual learning in 2020 had a negative impact on the perceptions of healthcare college students of the five technologies across the five TAM domains (perceived usefulness, facilitating condition, ease of use, attitude toward use, intention to use) and the actual use of these technologies. The TAM successfully explained the factors influencing the actual use of technologies by healthcare college students. Continuing technical support and training can reduce students' electronic challenges. Technical status assessment needs to be done at the beginning, mid and end of the semester to evaluate the technical challenges facing students in online learning. The study tools are internationally adoptable to evaluate the student perceptions of the ICT implementation for research and academic annual assessment purposes. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "To curb the spread of the COVID‐19 pandemic, the federal government and the federated entities of Belgium suspended all face‐to‐face learning starting 14 March, 2020. A continuity of learning was to be ensured by teachers through distance‐learning. However, teaching during the confinement period was complicated for teachers: the respect for policies and rules differs from one teacher to another and there has been a lack of follow‐up on online learning for some learners. The purpose of this article is to contribute to initial responses to the vast question of educational inequalities created and exacerbated during the crisis. More particularly, this article provides a situational analysis of some potential causes for inequalities in primary and secondary schools and identifies differences between the two education levels. Our analysis draws on responses from almost 500 teachers participating in a large‐scale survey in the French speaking Community of Belgium. The analysis focuses on teaching practices and observations made by teachers during the confinement period. Various factors contributing to inequalities are identified as well as differences between the two levels of education. Relevant factors include the technological equipment available to students, and the use of pedagogical practices such as differentiation and Remediation‐Consolidation‐Surpassing (RCS). After confinement, at the beginning of the 2020–2021 school year, teachers have faced more diverse classes, with learners who have experienced very different confinement situations. In light of our analysis of survey responses, we highlight the role of the technological equipment used by the teacher as a factor that increases inequalities. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "This research paper evaluates how schools have embraced technological platforms as they shift from traditional learning methods to online learning methods, prior and during the covid-19 pandemic. Technological platforms are a suite of online tools that permit collaboration between teachers and students, as well as provide parents/carer visibility of their child's school work in real-time. Such platforms permit equality, the creation of authentic learning material and collaboration that previously was inaccessible. Professional development and student boot camps were found to play a considerable role in all school stakeholders to use the technology. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "The study presented here was aimed at understanding how teachers go about appropriating technology from the iRead EU Horizon 2020 Project into the classroom. iRead provides an adaptive personalised literacy game called Navigo that is deployed in tablets and intended for regular usage in the elementary school classroom. In our case, the game was provided for beginning readers of German. The goal of iRead was to develop these games and then understand how these can be deployed successfully into the classroom. The adaptation of technology by teachers has been a well‐studied phenomenon for decades in some countries. However, in Germany, elementary schools lag behind in digitalisation, making such studies more difficult, resulting in a knowledge gap this study seeks to fill. Appropriation of the Navigo game by the teachers was studied through a series of semi‐formal interviews with 21 teachers from 9 schools, scheduled at the beginning, middle and end of the project, resulting in a total of 55 interviews. Results show that teachers had similar experiences within the project, and faced common stumbling blocks, such as (a) technology, (b) digital literacy and (c) understanding the pedagogical use of adaptive learning games. While teachers generally accepted that interacting with tablets taught pupils the important skill of digital literacy, most teachers did not fully understand how pupils acquired language skills through Navigo. Those teachers who understood the academic benefit of the learning game appropriated Navigo fully by purposefully leveraging the adaptivity of the games to support pupils in a personalised manner. Using thematic analysis and automatic clustering of keyword occurrences in the interviews, we were able to identify four 'personas' on the continuum of teacher characteristics. Mapping teachers to these 'personas' determined the level of support required during the appropriation process. It was shown that the 'personas' are relatively stable and can be identified within the first weeks of appropriation to ensure a successful process as soon as possible. Practitioner notesWhat is already known about this topicAppropriation of technology models.Technology use in school for older pupils.Educational games outside of school.What this paper addsA view on technology usage in elementary schools particular to the German context with large amount of teacher interviews from diverse schools.Personas that can be identified early on in the process of appropriation based on simple interviews.Particular challenges of using adaptive technology in the classroom.Implications for practice and/or policyA simple model for picking appropriate teacher support in appropriation.Results show a clear need for improving technology support in the schools.Teacher training must include digital competence and openness to the idea of independent learning paths.

        "The problem motivating this research is the rapid introduction of educational technologies and the strong push to use new technologies in technical and vocational training in China coupled with varied responses and uneven adoption of new tools on the part of practitioners. This study investigated the factors that influence technical and vocational college teachers' adoption and appreciation of information and communication technology (ICT) in China using the technology adoption and gratification (TAG) model. At total of 535 teachers from public technical and vocational colleges were surveyed using a purposive sampling procedure. The survey data were analyzed through structural equation modeling. Findings suggest that the use of ICT had three primary determinants: teaching purpose, research purpose and academic purpose. Technical and vocational college teachers' technology adoption and gratification was directly and indirectly predicted by their computer self‐efficacy, intention to use, perceived ease of use and usefulness of ICT. Most importantly, the TAG model accounted for 77% of the variance in teachers' gratification using those predictive variables. This research successfully applied the TAG model and it further fosters recommendations for future investigations. This study contributes to theoretical, methodical and practical understandings of the use of ICT in technical and vocational education, which has been much less explored than in K‐12 education and university settings.

        "Students' engagement has been a hot topic since the origin of teaching and learning; and is developing rapidly with time and technology. With the recent advances in Information and Communication Technology (e.g, Internet of Things, Artificial Intelligence and 5G), it is a need of the hour to revive its smart use in academia. In underdeveloped countries, parents are offended by financial burdens and educating children is not a priority, resulting students are not effectively engaged in learning. Smartphones are mostly used for fun and entertainment, why not for teaching, learning and monitoring to reshape pedagogy. This study investigated the role of social media in learners' engagement (l = 734) by making a productive relationship among the parents (p = 400), teachers (t = 21) and Principal in underdeveloped countries' schools. The results of the study are promising. The statistics for 2018-2019 (i.e, without social media), shows only 3% to 4 % parental participation in meetings and scarce teachers interest in schooling, resulting in the learner disengagement. However, the statistics from 2019-2020 (i.e, use of social media), shows improvements in the parental engagement up to 20% and teachers engagement up to 70%, resulting in a productive learners engagement. It is worth mentioning here that the school (located in the village), learner average attendance increased to 95% (dropped the truancy to almost zero), which got higher authorities admiration.

        "In 2019 a pilot project called 'Homeless Monopoly' evolved in Coventry to investigate how arts methodologies, dramatic scenarios and gamification could be used to raise awareness in young people regarding homelessness. This article investigates the origins and collaborative development of this project, but specifically focuses on how piloting the game in schools, colleges and universities has raised questions about the ways in which resourcefulness and resilience might be taught as adaptive and sustainable strategies through processes of rehearsing and discussing unpredictable challenges, vulnerabilities, support mechanisms and different life outcomes rooted in 'real-world' scenarios.

        "Scientific advances, particularly in evolutionary biology, genetics, neuroscience and artificial intelligence, present many challenges to religious and popular notions of personhood. This paper reports the first large-scale study on students' beliefs about the interactions between science and widely held beliefs about personhood. The paper presents findings from a questionnaire survey (n = 530) administered to English secondary school students (age 15–16) in which their beliefs and concepts regarding personhood and the position of science were investigated. The survey was motivated in part by an interview study and a previous, smaller survey which revealed that many students struggle to reconcile their beliefs with what they suppose science to say and also that some have reluctantly dismissed the soul as a 'nice story' which is incompatible with scientific facts. The results from this larger-scale survey indicate that a majority of the students believe in some form of soul. Even so, and regardless of whether or not they identified themselves as religious, most students expressed a belief that human persons cannot be fully explained scientifically, a position that some students perceived as a partial rejection of what it means to hold a scientific worldview.

        "The explosion of medical information demands a thorough reconsideration of medical education, including what we teach and assess, how we educate, and whom we educate. Physicians of the future will need to be self-aware, self-directed, resource-effective team players who can synthesize and apply summarized information and communicate clearly. Training in metacognition, data science, informatics, and artificial intelligence is needed. Education programs must shift focus from content delivery to providing students explicit scaffolding for future learning, such as the Master Adaptive Learner model. Additionally, educators should leverage informatics to improve the process of education and foster individualized, precision education. Finally, attributes of the successful physician of the future should inform adjustments in recruitment and admissions processes. This paper explores how member schools of the American Medical Association Accelerating Change in Medical Education Consortium adjusted all aspects of educational programming in acknowledgment of the rapid expansion of information.

        "Currently, we are at the beginning of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, where the rapid developments in genetics, artificial intelligence, robotics, nanotechnology, 3D printing and biotechnology are growing rapidly. It is expected that the majority of the children entering primary school today might end up working in jobs that do not yet exist. In such a fast‐changing employment landscape, the ability to prepare for future skills will be required to take advantage of the opportunities presented by these trends. National Dual Training System has been implemented by the Ministry of Human Resource to ensure TVET graduates are equipped with the employability skills needed in the job market. Questionnaires were distributed to employers from different training institutions, industries and agencies. The employers were to evaluate the level of employability skills obtained by the graduates that had gone through the National Dual Training System and then, the employers were asked to identify employability skills needed to meet employment demands in the Fourth Industry Revolution. The findings provide insights to the policymakers and curriculum developers on the appropriate interventions that need to be taken to ensure our graduates are well equipped with the employability skills needed for the future.

        "With the swift pivot to online learning, teachers and students have been forced to adopt a new way of teaching and learning, which has required students to become more self‐directed in their learning. In addition, teachers are faced with the challenge of preparing students for the workforce and lifelong learning. One emerging approach for addressing both these challenges is that of heutagogy, or self‐determined learning. This paper discusses the rising demand for lifelong learning skills and the role that heutagogy can play in supporting students in developing self‐directed and lifelong learning skills. Specifically, the paper presents a case study of a higher education institution that has introduced heutagogy, using interviews with programme leaders/instructors to investigate how a college in Israel incorporated heutagogy into their master's education programmes. Case study results reveal that there are challenges in incorporating heutagogy (eg, difficulty for students in adopting the approach), but once adopted, students preferred learning in a self‐determined way. Practitioner notesWhat is already known about this topic?Lifelong learning skills are critical to student employability, and there is a need for exploring new theories and approaches for developing these skills.The current pandemic has forced traditional learning into the online space, requiring more self‐directed learning skills in learners.Heutagogy has been identified as a net‐centric teaching and learning theory for online learning.What this paper addsPositions heutagogy for use in traditional and online classroom settings in order to develop learners' self‐directed and lifelong learning skills.Explores the pedagogy‐andragogy‐heutagogy continuum and its use as an instructional strategy.Presents a case study of a higher education institution that has implemented self‐determined learning.Implications for practice and/or policyThis study encourages further research into use of heutagogy for developing self‐directed and lifelong learning skills.This study provides guidance for those who want to introduce self‐determined learning into classroom settings.

        "A major controversy facing the field of gifted education is the underrepresentation of low income, minority, and dual language students. Strategies for addressing this challenge have been to use universal screening and local norms; however, these useful recommendations continue to focus on traditional testing procedures that measure what students already know and overlook other important traits that contribute to high levels of creative productivity. Assessment for learning examines traits such as interests, instructional preference styles, preferred modes of expression, and executive function skills. Although sometimes referred as the \"soft skills,\" they have gained much more attention on the parts of college admission officers and employers, especially for higher level leadership positions. Instruments that assess these traits are often completed by the students themselves; and technology and artificial intelligence now allow us to administer and analyze them with the same ease used for traditional standardized tests.

        "Research relating to the development of computational thinking (CT) at primary school level is still in its infancy despite indications that it is most effective when introduced in primary/early secondary education. Teachers are pivotal to ensuring children develop CT, so it is essential they are effectively prepared, starting at preservice level, to incorporate CT into pedagogical practices. Grounded in constructionist principles and adopting the stance that CT be developed as part of subject areas other than computer science, this qualitative study presents findings focused on the understandings of CT of 51 preservice teachers who engaged in a digital learning specialism. Carried out over a 2‐year period, the research investigated preservice teachers' understandings of CT and how the design of the specialism helped to develop their understanding. Findings highlight deep understandings of CT among the preservice teachers who were able to make connections between constructionism and the development of CT. They also demonstrated a high level of pedagogical knowledge, indicating they understood why they designed particular challenges for children as part of their classroom experience. Findings are relevant for the design of teacher preparation programmes illustrating how CT can be effectively embedded to combine theory and practice. Practitioner notesWhat is already known about this topic Existing research base in relation to preservice teacher education and computational thinking is limited.When computational thinking is introduced as part of initial teacher education, preservice teachers: develop more accurate and increased understandings of computational thinkingdemonstrate more positive attitudes towards the implementation of computational thinking in the classroom.Duration of module seems to be a significant factor. A 1‐week module might be enough to develop preservice teachers' surface‐level understanding of computational thinking, but it would not provide them with enough knowledge to embed computational thinking in meaningful ways in the classroom (Yadav et al., 2014).What this paper adds Adopting the stance that computational thinking should be developed as part of subject areas other than computer science.This paper presents and discusses findings from the implementation of a model for preservice teacher education grounded in constructionism, that supports preservice primary teachers in building an understanding of CT as well as the pedagogical knowledge necessary for embedding CT into their classroom practice.Implications for practice and/or policy The insights gained from this study are particularly relevant for the design of teacher preparation programmes indicating how CT can be effectively embedded to combine theory and practice.This will ensure that CT concepts are not developed in a decontexualised manner but are embedded within the prescribed curriculum in a relevant and meaningful manner.

        "In the context of trying to improve reading proficiency in elementary school students, this study investigated the use of digital technology as part of a blended learning program, Core5, in kindergarten and first grade classes. A quasi‐experimental design compared 283 treatment students instructed in schools using Core5 with 237 control students in schools using traditional instruction in an urban school district. At the beginning of the school year, all students were pretested with Dynamic Indicators of Basic Early Literacy Skills (DIBELS), a commonly used reading assessment. During the school year, the treatment schools implemented Core5, which includes the online component and offline teacher‐led lessons. The English Language Arts curriculum was evaluated and found to be similar across treatment and control schools. At the end of the school year, all students were post‐tested with DIBELS. Results from propensity score analyses showed that treatment students outperformed control students and that the discrepancy between treatment and control groups on post‐test scores was more pronounced when students had lower pretest scores. These outcomes point to the value of using Core5 for reading instruction in early elementary grades. Lay Description: Only one‐third of US elementary school students are proficient readers, and to address this problem, a growing number of schools are adopting blended learning programs designed to support for literacy skill growth through scaffolded online and teacher‐led offline activities.This study evaluated the effectiveness of this approach in a real‐world school setting using a quasi‐experimental design that compared students in schools using a blended learning program to students in schools using traditional English Language Arts curricula.Students in schools using blended learning outperformed students in schools using traditional curricula.These findings point to the value of blended learning in school settings.

        "In the modern education system, new technological teaching aids are used to support learning, to increase motivation and adaptation of students. Game-based Learning (GBL) is one of such aids that it can be successfully integrated to improve teaching and learning in diverse courses. In computer science courses, the concept of programming is found confusing and difficult to understand by students. This study is conducted to investigate and analyze the disposition of 5th grade primary school students on programming through a digital game-play. Sixty-three 5th grade primary school students, with little or no programming knowledge, performed various activities through a digital game framework. The study is based on a descriptive survey model and was carried out by using convergent mixed method design for data collection process. The data were collected through quantitative and qualitative approaches consecutively after the students were experimenting on the given digital game-based activity. The findings indicated that digital game-play helped the students to understand the concept of programming and it is observed that students have developed positive disposition towards programming through game-based activities even if they can have preconceptions.

        "The use of head mounted displays (HMDs) to experience virtual realities (VR) has become increasingly common. As this technology becomes more affordable, immersive and easier to use, it also becomes more serviceable in educational and training contexts. Even though the technology, content and feasibility for K-12 school purposes are still being developed, it is reasonable to expect that the call or 'push' to use HMD VR in K-12 schools will increase, especially as there is now a greater economic interest in the use of digital technologies in educational contexts. This article aims to inform the process of implementing HMD VR in K-12 contexts by researching the preconditions and challenges of use from a teacher perspective. It does this by analysing the organisational, institutional, contextual and practical challenges and opportunities in the implementation of HMD VR in K-12 school contexts. The data draws on (a) interviews, informal conversations and observations of teachers testing HMD VR and different VR applications in a Digital Learning Lab (DLL) and (b) data from a project involving upper secondary school history teachers discussing the planned implementation of HMD VR in their teaching and being in the DLL. The main findings are related to: (a) economy and technology, (b) initial learning barriers, (c) organisation and practical enactment for teaching and learning, (d) curricula, syllabuses and expected learning outcomes and (e) teachers' competences, professional development and trust. The consequences for educational contexts and possible ways forward are also discussed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "General chemistry are key gateway courses for many Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) majors. To improve student outcomes, it is critical both to identify at-risk students and implement evidence-based instructional strategies and interventions. These remain active areas of investigation, with recent literature showing that cognitive, affective and demographic characteristics all contribute as risk factors. Here we report an assessment of demographic characteristics and early-course cognitive measures in predicting student outcomes in first-term general chemistry (GC1), comparing an adaptive learning pre-assessment using ALEKS (Assessment and LEarning in Knowledge Spaces) with a traditional diagnostic exam. Student performance was evaluated across three sections (345 students) in a quasi-experimental pre-test/post-test design using a common ACS final exam. We find that ∼57% of variance in ACS final exam scores and ∼60% of variance in final course grades is related to three predictors: initial ALEKS knowledge check, diagnostic exam score, and predicted first year QPA, an internal metric based upon high school GPA, ACT/SAT scores, and college of admission. While no single metric could identify even one-half of students scoring lowest in the course (i.e. in the bottom 15%, consistent with the percentage of D's, F's and withdrawals in our sections), in combination ∼ 80% were identified.

        "The adoption of technology in teaching has been identified to relate to various factors from attitudes and self‐efficacy to subjective norms and digital references. The aim of this study is to broaden the perspective to hierarchical grouping effects. Multilevel modelling of the study utilizes the data of 2355 Finnish basic education teachers. The results show that, before the coronavirus pandemic, Finnish teachers used digital devices in teaching at least once a week, on average, and many times on a daily basis, varying according to the subject being taught. The variation in teachers' technology usage occurs mainly at the individual level, with a small proportion between schools; higher‐level hierarchies proved redundant in the context of Finland. At the teacher level, digital skills, age, and digital self‐efficacy increase technology usage in teaching. At the end, the significance and limitations of the research and the direction of future research in the post‐pandemic era are discussed. Lay Description: What is already known about the topicTechnology usage in teaching is related to teachers' attitudes, skills and self‐efficacy.The importance of subjective norms and digital referents has also been identified.There is a need for a multidimensional approach that goes beyond the individual level.What this paper addsBefore the pandemic, digital technology was adopted on a weekly basis among Finnish teachers.The subject taught by the teacher has an impact on the quantity of digital technology usage.The technology usage varies at individual‐level, rather than at the higher‐levels. Implications for practiceTeachers' digital maturity is expected to influence the experiences of the pandemic period.The dominance of the individual‐level impacts the implementation of education policy.Research needs to take into account the context and hierarchies of different education systems.

        "Mobile learning (M-learning) is currently popular. Although M-learning has a positive effect on the interest, attitude, initiative, and learning of learners, it comes with the negative effect of distraction. Exploring the factors that influence M-learning concentration have become a popular research subject. Environment (quiet and noisy) and posture (sitting, standing, and moving) are two typical factors that directly influence the concentration of mobile learners. This study focuses on the influence of environment and posture on concentration in M-learning. A total of 120 college students were randomly divided into two environment groups, namely, the quiet and noisy environments. The two groups were subjected to M-learning experiments by adopting sitting, standing, and moving postures. This study shows that (1) interaction effects on Mlearning concentration existed between environment and posture and a quiet environment and a sitting posture enable learners to concentrate better; and (2) no interaction effects on M-learning achievement existed between environment and posture, while environment and posture alone had a significant effect on learning achievement. This study presents several implications of the M-learning practice, deficiencies of the research, and the direction of future studies in this field. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "This article considers how the development of for-profit artificial intelligence (AI) technologies fosters the privatization of public education and erodes the values and practices of democratic education. The introduction situates the advent of digital technologies in the context of the structural economic and ideological shifts of the past 40 years. Such changes include neo-liberal restructuring, the repressive school and social turn, changes in the use of positivist ideology in schooling, the role of new technologies in social and cultural reproduction and changing imperatives for capital accumulation. The article illustrates different uses of AI as part of the technological turn of public education privatization. Examples include: (1) adaptive learning technology, and transformations to teacher work and conceptions of knowledge and learning; (2) biometric pedagogy and the cultural politics of locating learning in the body; and (3) the convergence of impact investing and digital surveillance technologies. The article considers how changes in the ownership and control over different aspects of public education relate to the cultural politics of knowledge and learning. It also examines how, under the guise of disinterested objectivity and neutrality, particular class and cultural ideologies and interests are promoted through new technologies, with significant pedagogical, cultural, economic and political implications. The article concludes by arguing that AI education is a site of cultural and political contestation and must be comprehended as a form of representational politics. By showing a critical pedagogical AI project, the article suggests that the anti-democratic tendencies of most AI education is hardly inevitable or determined, but rather represents a replication of long-standing ideologies.

        "Revising is central in the process of writing and for acquiring writing skills. Setting revision goals is challenging especially for novice writers: students do not revise frequently, especially in homework conditions that demand high levels of self-regulation. Empirical studies of goal-setting interventions providing a detailed list of goals show positive effects on students' revisions, and researchers have argued that individualizing such goal-setting interventions could increase intervention effectiveness. The present study investigated an individualized goal-setting intervention that provided a list of goals based on students' previous writing using automated writing evaluation. Participants were 345 academic track students from upper-secondary schools in Germany. We asked students to write a text in English as a second language (ESL) as homework and then to revise it. In a hierarchical sequence of four groups, we expanded the information to support students in self-evaluating their texts and setting appropriately challenging revising goals in a stepwise manner. Students received a textbook passage showing a list of process goals (all groups), an assessment rubric (groups two, three, and four), an automated performance score (groups three and four), and individualized goal-setting instruction based on their performance score and the textbook passage (group four). Students receiving individualized goal-setting instructions showed the largest revision performance compared to the other groups, with and without controlling for text length. We discuss how goal-setting support in ESL writing can benefit from automated writing evaluation to provide individualized support and thus improve the effectiveness of goal-setting interventions in supporting students' revision performances. [Display omitted] • Experimental study investigating the effects of goal-setting interventions on student writing. • We individualized the provided goals based on automated writing evaluation. • Individualized goals outperformed control goal-setting interventions. • We integrated research from writing studies, educational technology, and psychology.

        "Aim: This study aims to hear the voices of autistic learners to investigate the meaning they made of their learning experiences during the lockdown period of school closures necessitated by the Covid-19 pandemic - particularly, what were the factors that contributed to positive engagement in remote digital learning, and were there any challenges? Method/Rationale: Three mainstream secondary schools in Scotland were asked to identify pupils who they perceived to have demonstrated increased engagement with learning via virtual means. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with seven pupils, ranging from S1 - S3 (Years 8 - 10 in England and Wales) during lockdown, to ask about their experiences of learning at home. Findings: Thematic analysis identified six key themes - life at home, technology, working independently, curriculum, adult support and peer support - involving key elements that supported the young people's engagement. Although all the participants identified supportive elements, aspects of remote learning that presented challenge to engagement were also expressed. These emerged under the same themes. Limitations: The sample size was small and allowed exploration rather than generalisation. The research is based on pupil voice and not triangulated with additional quantitative or qualitative measures. Conclusions: The study explored autistic young people's experiences of learning during lockdown and found, consistent with prior literature, how tasks are mediated online and the nature of adult contact to support this, were key to supporting engagement in learning. Flexibility and control over a goal-directed timetable was also important. Reflections suggest planning implications for schools and educational psychologists, particularly as remote learning remains a key tenet for curricular delivery and development.

        "At a time of widespread concern over the decline of art teaching in schools, this article considers the findings of a practitioner led action research project exploring the potential of art museum and artist‐led CPD (Continued Professional Development) programmes to develop primary teacher knowledge, skills and confidence teaching in art and design. The project involved 68 teachers from over 40 primary schools who were introduced to a Renaissance painting of Cupid and Psyche in a series of training sessions at the museum in early 2019. Schools were then invited to submit art work to an end‐of‐project exhibition which opened in December. Over the course of the year, more than 500 children aged between 4 and 11 visited the museum to look at the painting and more than 3,800 studied it at school using specially created digital learning resources. We draw on survey and email feedback, interviews, blog posts, photographs and artwork collected during the project to discuss how the project provided expert training about art objects, materials and processes and brought teachers together to transform practice and extend pupil outcomes. We also consider how a constructivist pedagogy might encourage more participatory, open ended and playful approaches to teaching art and design to stimulate careful looking, deep thinking, and experimentation with materials and techniques. The article concludes with a discussion of the potential of communities of practice to bring together artists, teachers and art museum professionals to support the development of visual literacy and creativity in children and young people.

        "This research consisted of two studies to investigate how the Chinese rural educational system supported students' online learning and to determine the factors that influenced students' online learning quality (satisfaction and cognitive and social presence) during the COVID‐19 pandemic. Study 1, based on interviews with three curriculum officers, seven principals and 30 course teachers, found that great efforts were made to realize digital equity and education for all students. The necessity of providing resources and support to teachers and students (facilitating conditions) was recognized, along with the importance of teachers' online course design and organization and the facilitation of discourse (teaching presence and social presence). Based on the findings of Study 1 and the literature review, a conceptual model of facilitating conditions and teaching presence reported to influence students' online learning quality was generated. In Study 2, 1,409 students from three rural primary schools were surveyed to test the conceptual model. The results indicated that facilitating conditions influenced students' online learning quality through enhanced technology self‐efficacy and perceived usefulness. Teaching presence directly and positively predicted students' online learning quality. This research highlights the importance of creating a learning community and providing technology access and support to ensure online learning opportunities and quality for rural students. Practitioner notesWhat is already known about this topic Chinese students from rural or migrant schools have fewer opportunities to access computers and the Internet, lower frequencies of online activity and technology self‐efficacy and less training and parental and teacher support.Providing support and resources to encourage and facilitate technology use among teachers and students in rural and underdeveloped schools is of great importance.Identifying the factors that contribute to online learning quality among rural school students to tackle the transition to online learning is necessary.What this paper adds The rural government and schools have made great efforts to ensure digital equity and education for all students, despite family conditions.Facilitating purposeful interactions and providing timely feedback is critical for effective learning in online teaching.Facilitating conditions represented by available support and resources and teaching presence influence students' online learning quality in rural areas.Implications for practice and/or policy Providing digital equipment and resources to all students is the first step towards distance learning.Providing opportunities to improve teachers' digital competency is critical for providing quality online instruction.Providing students timely assistance and useful and learner‐friendly technologies to enhance their satisfaction and social and cognitive presence is necessary.Online instructors should create a friendly online learning environment, facilitate active discussion and purposeful reflection and create opportunities to promote students' open communication, group cohesion and meaning construction.

        "To support young children's learning during the coronavirus 2019 (COVID‐19) pandemic, preschool educators in Hong Kong were required to teach with digital technologies. In this study, 1035 educators from 169 preschools reported their views and practices in an online survey, which we examined via multilevel mixed‐response analysis and thematic analysis. More than half of the respondents (53%) expected future online teaching to continue, and only 11% of educators believed that parents would reject this form of delivery. Administrators and teaching assistants were more likely than teachers to expect online preschool teaching to continue in the future. In addition, respondents with existing online platform experience, who taught the upper levels of preschool, or incorporated specific teaching practices (eg, after the online lesson, they assessed children and assigned homework tasks), were more likely than others to expect online teaching in the future. Many of these respondents also reported (a) difficulty with engaging their children when online and (b) inadequate support from parents for learning activities, which reduced the respondents' perceived likelihood of future online teaching. Administrators and teaching assistants were more likely than teachers to believe that parents would accept online teaching in the future. Respondents who felt they had inadequate training to teach online, children in families with inadequate technical skills and parents who believed that online lessons harmed children's well‐being, were less likely than others to believe that parents would accept online teaching in the future. These educators believed that online learning communities could connect parents and schools and foster interaction that could help align with educator's support for children's learning needs. Practitioner notesWhat is already known about technology integration for young children during COVID‐19COVID‐19 led to the closure of many schools, requiring teachers to teach online.Barriers to integrating technologies in preschool settings existed before the pandemic.Online teaching can support students' learning, but few studies have examined technology integration for preschoolers at home during a pandemic.What this paper addsThis paper adds new data on schooling during a pandemic. During the closures, preschool teachers applied two major online teaching approaches: (a) digital content interaction and (b) online human interaction.Technology integration was added to provide evidence of how teachers applied online learning resources for young children during COVID‐19.During closures, teachers often delivered learning resources via digital‐mediated learning platforms, but they were less likely than other educators to expect online teaching in the future.Educators who perceived greater engagement of children or support from parents were more likely to expect online teaching in the future.Implications for practice and/or policyThis study showed that some preschool teachers integrated technology into their teaching during a pandemic, and future studies can explore how to facilitate or extend this integration after the pandemic.This study showed the need for more interactive online teaching preparation to address young children's learning needs.Some teachers were responsive to feedback from children and monitored their learning during the online teaching process.

        "Digital technology offers the potential to address educational challenges in resource‐poor settings. This meta‐analysis examines the impact of students' use of technology that personalises and adapts to learning level in low‐ and middle‐income countries. Following a systematic search for research between 2007 and 2020, 16 randomised controlled trials were identified in five countries. Studies involved 53,029 learners aged 6–15 years. Coding examined learning domain (mathematics and literacy); personalisation level and delivery; technology use; and intervention duration and intensity. Overall, technology‐supported personalised learning was found to have a statistically significant—if moderate—positive effect size of 0.18 on learning (p = 0.001). Meta‐regression reveals how more personalised approaches which adapt or adjust to learners' level led to significantly greater impact (an effect size of 0.35) than those only linking to learners' interests or providing personalised feedback, support, and/or assessment. Avenues for future research include investigating cost implications, optimum programme length, and teachers' role in making personalised learning with technology effective. Practitioner notesWhat is already known about this topic?Promoting personalised learning is an established aim of educators.Using technology to support personalised learning in low‐ and middle‐income countries (LMICs) could play an important role in ensuring more inclusive and equitable access to education, particularly in the aftermath of COVID‐19.There is currently no rigorous overview of evidence on the effectiveness of using technology to enable personalised learning in LMICs.What this paper adds?The meta‐analysis is the first to evaluate the effectiveness of technology‐supported personalised learning in improving learning outcomes for school‐aged children in LMICs.Technology‐supported personalised learning has a statistically significant, positive effect on learning outcomes.Interventions are similarly effective for mathematics and literacy and whether or not teachers also have an active role in the personalisation.Personalised approaches that adapt or adjust to the learner led to significantly greater impact, although whether these warrant the additional investment likely necessary for implementation at scale needs to be investigated.Personalised technology implementation of moderate duration and intensity had similar positive effects to that of stronger duration and intensity, although further research is needed to confirm this.Implications for practice and/or policy:The inclusion of more adaptive personalisation features in technology‐assisted learning environments can lead to greater learning gains.Personalised technology approaches featuring moderate personalisation may also yield learning rewards.While it is not known whether personalised technology can be scaled in a cost‐effective and contextually appropriate way, there are indications that this is possible.The appropriateness of teachers integrating personalised approaches in their practice should be explored given 'supplementary' uses of personalised technology (ie, additional sessions involving technology outside of regular instruction) are common.

        "This study was conducted during the transition to emergency online learning, imposed by the spread of a worldwide pandemic known as COVID-19. The study aimed to examine the factors that influenced student agency during this sudden transition to synchronous online learning in the College of Education at Qatar University. By adopting a mixed methods research design, a total of 202 student teachers responded to a newly developed survey which explored four factors known to influence agency, and provided numerical data on their perceptions towards these factors. Results indicated a three-factor structure, namely: motivation and self-efficacy beliefs; self-regulated learning; and socio-cultural support. Following initial quantitative analysis, nine student teachers were recruited to engage in in-depth interviews. Qualitative analysis supported the theoretical framework of the factors influencing student agency, and further provided a nuanced understanding of the particularities involved in the way these factors were manifested within this novel context. Implications of the findings on the future implementation of emergency online learning are discussed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "The purpose of this study is to explore the effect of a pedagogical model of digital games on students' scientific competencies that are advocated by the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA). As a single game‐based learning strategy may not be enough to enhance such competencies, the online game in the current study incorporated the design of the proposed pedagogical gamification, assessment, modeling, and enquiry (GAME) model. The participants were 69 sixth grade students at one primary school in Taiwan. A quasi‐experimental design was adopted. The experimental group students learned with the GAME model, whereas the comparison group students only learned with traditional learning way. The results showed that the learning gain in scientific competencies of the experimental group was better than those of the comparison group. This study revealed that the GAME model has potential to promote students' PISA scientific competencies. It is suggested that the integral GAME model may serve as one kind of strategies to enhance students' scientific competencies. Lay Description: What is already known about this topic: The existing literature suggested that GBL has the potential to improve science learning.Studies of the effect of GBL on students' scientific competencies are still limited. What this paper adds: This study proposed the pedagogical GAME model that consists of gamification, assessment, modeling, and enquiry.This study revealed that the GAME model led to differences in primary school students' scientific competencies. Implications for practice and/or policy: The enquiry activities embedded in games were shown to be crucial for students' learning gains of scientific competencies.The GAME model may serve as a reference for improving students' scientific literacy.

        "The University of Glasgow Bachelor of Dental Surgery (BDS) degree programme is a professionally regulated, practical clinical discipline. Given the mode of transmission of SARS Cov-2 the dental profession and associated degree programmes of study have like other university programmes been significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, necessitating a rapid pivot to online and blended learning. This case study shows how the work of early adopters of technology enhanced learning and teaching (TELT) at the dental school, and a timely staff-student partnership helped to lay the foundations for this pivot in response to the challenges brought about by a Global Pandemic. A large amount of teaching required modification and adaptation to support remote delivery, and through collaboration, innovation and supported creativity, we were able to produce some very effective models for learning and teaching. To illustrate this, two specific examples have been presented: a novel approach to support the delivery of essential local anaesthesia training for second year dental students using collaborative wikis and online learning; and the use of Microsoft Teams to support student integration and a sense of community among our first year dental students through active, small group collaborative learning. The challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic have provided the opportunity to align the teaching of practical skills with technology and instil a positive shift in institutional practices. The effectiveness of this shift within the BDS degree programme and the impact on the development of our students will remain the focus of the school's TELT partnership. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "Peer feedback is referred to as comments provided by one student to another with the intention to aid their peers' progress in learning. The responses or feedback provided by peers has been recognised as an integral part of the learning process in online learning environments. However, the research on using peer feedback to stimulate students' higher level of thinking, especially at the secondary school level, in asynchronous online discussions is rather limited. Hence, this is a gap that the researcher attempts to address in this study. A case study was conducted among Economics students from an all-girls high school located at the northern part of Malaysia. The findings show that the most common type of feedback provided by students in the four AODs was categorised at cognitive dimension, with the affective and the metacognitive dimensions following behind. Even though most of the students had positive perceptions toward peer feedback of their learning in AODs, the findings show that there was a lack of constructive feedback found in AOD forums. Therefore, based on the findings of this study, some recommendations for future research have been proposed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "Constructionism, long before it had a name, was intimately tied to the field of Artificial Intelligence. Soon after the birth of Logo at BBN, Seymour Papert set up the Logo Group as part of the MIT AI Lab. Logo was based upon Lisp, the first prominent AI programming language. Many early Logo activities involved natural language processing, robotics, artificial game players, and generating poetry, art, and music. In the 1970s researchers explored enhancements to Logo to support AI programming by children. In the 1980s the Prolog community, inspired by Logo's successes, began exploring how to adapt logic programming for use by school children. While there have been over 40 years of active AI research in creating intelligent tutoring systems, there was little AI‐flavoured constructionism after the 1980s until about 2017 when suddenly a great deal of activity started. Amongst those activities were attempts to enhance Scratch, Snap!, and MIT App Inventor with new blocks for speech synthesis, speech recognition, image recognition, and the use of pre‐trained deep learning models. The Snap! enhancements also include support for word embeddings, as well as blocks to enable learners to create, train, and use deep neural networks. Student and teacher project‐oriented resources highlighting these new AI programming components appeared at the same time. In this paper, we review this history, providing a unique perspective on AI developments—both social and technical—from a constructionist perspective. Reflecting on these, we close with speculations about possible futures for AI and constructionism. Practitioner notesWhat is already known about this topicThere exist excellent broad surveys of the current status of teaching machine learning in schools, for example Marques et al. (2020). There are historical collections of AI and education research papers that include descriptions of constructionist activities, for example Yazdani (1984).What this paper addsThis paper adds an in‐depth focus on historical and current efforts on AI and education that support constructionist teaching. This focus enables us to delve deeper than a broad survey. Uniquely, we provide a 50‐year historical perspective on constructionist AI tools, trials, and research. Grounded in this history and our survey of current tools and projects, we provide speculations about future directions.Implications for practice and/or policyWe hope our descriptions of current AI programming tools for non‐experts placed in a broad historical context will be of use to teachers wishing to introduce AI to their students in a constructionist manner, as well as to developers and researchers aiming to support such teaching.

        "Teaching complex studio processes requires methods beyond linear step‐by‐step instruction and methods more consistent with authentic studio practices. Instructors have to be able to deconstruct their own decision‐making processes, processes that have become somewhat automatic through experience, and then use this insight to anticipate how learners with less experience might respond when presented with a similar series of creative dilemmas. The author outlines a project in which pre‐service art teachers in a secondary methods course employ technology‐mediated methods, i.e. graphic organisers, instructional videos and online learning guides, to better understand complex studio processes and how to teach those processes through ubiquitous technologies The qualities of this work became evident during the 2020 coronavirus (COVID‐19) pandemic and consequent school closures, when the pandemic presented teacher preparation programmes with a unique challenge in how to negotiate pre‐service teaching practicums in a semester where students did not have ready access to a secondary art classroom.

        "This article describes how the emergency shift to remote teaching at the Adam Smith Business School (ASBS) in 2020 led to the emergence of a new framework for blended and online learning and teaching (BOLT). We explain how a quorum of early adopters and innovators developed this framework from first principles and how it differs from existing frameworks for digital development. Rather than adopt an existing set of procedures, the framework was developed from the bottom-up with the advantage of high levels of agility, and commitment. Early adopters of technology enhanced learning and teaching (TELT) became bricoleurs, adapting and repurposing existing technologies and processes rather than adopting an entirely new strategy. This article will describe the process of empowering early adopters to enhance crisis response as well as giving a detailed overview of the framework, which can be used in other contexts. Beginning by describing the principles for developing remote teaching from scratch, we provide a case study in implementing such a framework. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "This study investigated how peer comments made using a video annotation tool (VAT) through an online learning community improved student-teachers' level of reflective thinking and communication competence throughout the simulated (i.e., role-play) context of consultation practice. Eighty student-teachers from two classes of the course \"Comprehensive School Guidance\" participated in this study, and all recorded two videos for their tripartite practice on parent consultation for self-evaluation and peer comment. Forty student-teachers were in the comparison class and provided general comments to their peers on the learning platform, while those in the experimental class used the VAT on the learning platform to provide specific comments to their peers. Two post-practice online questionnaires and reflective journal entries, which aimed to measure communication competence and reflective thinking ability, were administered to the student-teachers after the first and second consultation practice. The reflective journal entries were segmented into units of analysis that were scored using a 4-level model of reflective thinking (from 1 to 4), with a higher score indicating demonstration of a higher level of reflective thinking for that particular segment. Both the number of reflective notes made and the average level of reflective thinking in student-teachers' journal entries were indicators of reflective thinking ability. Two mixed ANOVAs were conducted to examine whether student-teachers in the experimental (VAT) class improved their reflective thinking ability and communication competence more significantly than those in the comparison (non-VAT) class. The results showed that student-teachers in both the VAT and non-VAT classes had statistically higher scores for communication competence and reflective thinking in the second role-play practice. Student-teachers with the support of VAT, in comparison to those without, significantly improved their average reflective thinking ability. Focus group interviews were also conducted to investigate how VAT could support student-teachers' learning process and to learn their perceptions of the strengths and limitations of the VAT. The results indicated that the VAT could enhance student-teachers' learning by reducing communication barriers created by the tendency to avoid direct observations of peers' weaknesses, enhancing reflection-in-action during practice, and contextualizing written comments by referring to specific video segments. However, student-teachers felt that the VAT should also allow users to draw on the video screens. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "With the advancement of technology, eLearning is increasingly adopted as an instructional method in a wide range of educational settings and has opened up new possibilities in teaching and learning practices. However, there is insufficient empirical evidence to illustrate how eLearning benefits teaching and learning practice in its real-world applications. Therefore, an important question is raised – How can eLearning technology facilitate pedagogical advancement practically in the classroom? In this study, we focus on constructivist pedagogies, emphasizing the dramatic educational reform from teacher-centered pedagogy to a student-centered, constructivist approach. Based on observations of 79 eLearning classes in eight primary schools, four secondary schools, and two special education schools in Hong Kong, this study illustrates how eLearning technology can advance at least five constructivist pedagogies: 1) active learning, 2) student-centered learning, 3) peer learning, 4) personalized learning, and 5) differentiated learning. We illustrate that the interactive, self-paced, repetitious, and customizable features of eLearning systems facilitate the implementation of these five constructivist pedagogies. Successful examples from classroom observations are drawn to illustrate how teachers make practical use of eLearning technology. This article serves to stimulate further discussion on how eLearning can be applied across various settings to advance the effectiveness of constructivist pedagogies and to encourage practitioners to consider how to make use of eLearning technology in the classroom.

        "Background: The importance of digital technologies for enhancing learning in formal education settings has been widely acknowledged. In the light of this expectation, it is important to investigate the effects of these technologies on students' learning and development. Purpose: This study explores longitudinal empirical research on digital learning in the context of primary and secondary education. By focusing on a small selection of the peer-reviewed literature, the aim is to examine the kinds of longitudinal study published on this topic during the period 2012–2017 and, thorough categorisation, to bring together insights about the reported influences of digital technology use on students' learning. Design and methods: The databases searched for the purposes of this review were Scopus and Web of Science. Of 1,989 articles, 13 were finally included in the review. Using qualitative content analysis, these were analysed, coded and categorised. Results: The reviewed studies were found to have approached digital learning in different ways: they varied, for example, in terms of research methods and design and the digital technologies used. The studies addressed different aspects of learning, which we assigned to six categories: affection, attitude, and motivation; subject-specific knowledge and skills; transversal skills; learning experience; elements of the learning environment; and identity. We identified both positive and negative influences of technology on learning. Conclusions: This review offers a snapshot of the variety of research in this fast-moving area. The studies we explored were found to approach digital learning from several different perspectives, and no straightforward conclusions can be drawn about the influences of digital technology use on students' learning. We conclude that further longitudinal studies of digital learning are needed, and this study assists by highlighting gaps in the existing literature. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "As online K–12 education continues to expand, concerns about its quality have taken centre stage. This study utilised online learning satisfaction as an outcome indicator for the success of online learning, and investigated student- and teacher-level factors that affected it among 226 high school students taking online world language courses from 15 teachers at a Midwestern virtual school in the US. Hierarchical linear modelling revealed that, at the student level, learner–content interaction was the only significant predictor of satisfaction; while at the teacher level, satisfaction was positively and significantly correlated with teachers' adoption of pedagogical roles, but negatively predicted by their adoption of managerial ones. The findings particularly highlight the importance of content-based teaching and learning in the context of K–12 world language learning. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "Contemporary young students in Asia and in the Nordic region are increasingly learning English outside the classroom by using technology (a.k.a. Informal Digital Learning of English [IDLE]). This comparative study examines to what extent IDLE influences Korean and Swedish students' willingness to communicate in a second language (L2 WTC), a critical antecedent affecting actual L2 communication behaviour. After having achieved a cross‐cultural equivalence of the research instrument, Korean (n = 388) and Swedish (n = 144) secondary school students were surveyed. Results of hierarchical regression analyses show that Frequency of IDLE (the total amount of IDLE activities) predicts both cohorts' L2 WTC, while Receptive IDLE activity (consuming English content) and Productive IDLE activity (producing English content) are predictors for only Koreans' L2 WTC. Results suggest that Korean and Swedish students tend to more frequently initiate English communication when engaging in IDLE activities. Results also suggest how Receptive and Productive IDLE activities could uniquely facilitate the L2 communication behaviour of Korean EFL learners, who learn English in a linguistically and culturally homogeneous society. Apart from context‐specific pedagogical implications, this study could provide insights for L2 learners worldwide who have been learning language remotely with minimal supervision. Practitioner notesWhat is already known about this topic Informal Digital Learning of English (IDLE) has been found to be beneficial in Korean and Swedish EFL students' communication skills and productive vocabulary knowledge.Diversity (a combination of form‐ and meaning‐focused activities), not frequency (amount of time) of IDLE activities, is a significant predictor of Korean learners' scores on a productive vocabulary test. These results stand in contrast to results found in Sweden that reported a positive relationship between frequency of IDLE activities and productive vocabulary test scores.After having achieved a cross‐cultural equivalence of the questionnaire, this comparative study aims to examine to what extent IDLE influences Korean and Swedish students' willingness to communicate in a second language (L2 WTC), which is a critical antecedent affecting actual L2 communication behaviour.What this paper adds Frequency of IDLE predicts both cohorts' L2 WTC.Receptive (consuming English content) and Productive IDLE activities (producing English content) seem to uniquely facilitate the L2 communication behaviour of Korean EFL learners, who learn English in a linguistically and culturally homogeneous society.Implications for practice and policy Informed by these results, L2 policymakers and teachers can design and implement socio‐culturally and contextually appropriate curricula and pedagogical practices to enhance learners' L2 WTC and, ultimately, L2 communicative competence.This study also provides insights for L2 learners worldwide who have been learning language remotely, with minimal supervision.

        "In this paper, we discuss the need for new approaches to research regarding coding to support students in developing practices in computational thinking, such as abstraction and decomposition, in multidisciplinary contexts. We explore students' activities with a tool integrating constructionist textual programming activity with game‐based learning and specifically game modding. In this context, we designed a programmable 'design‐to‐play' game developed with the computational environment MaLT2. MaLT2 offers the affordances of textual programming, dynamic manipulation, and 3D navigation for the design of 3D animated models aiming to give children access to, otherwise, complex, computational and mathematical ideas. To develop an understanding of children's learning activity regarding computational practices, we organised an empirical study with middle‐school students, who played a game called 'Code‐the‐Mime'. It is a charades‐based game in which the players manipulate, programme, and modify a digital human model to describe a word to their teammates. The preliminary findings indicate that the affordances of MaLT2 in conjunction with the game context enabled students to express and develop key computational practices, including decomposition, pattern recognition, analysis and abstraction, in a meaningful and multidisciplinary context. Practitioner notesWhat is already known about this topic Computational Thinking is considered a key 21st‐century skill in preparing the young to become digital citizens. It involves concepts and practices that can be used to solve problems computationally across multiple fields. However, there is still limited knowledge of how students develop computational practices, such as abstraction, pattern recognition, decomposition, and how they may express and apply them in diverse contexts. Students' engagement with computational practices is unlikely to be supported either by closed, simplified coding tasks or higher‐level advanced programming exercises. There is a need to clarify the manifestation of these practices and how they can be realised and expressed and used by learners in meaningful and transdisciplinary contexts.What this paper adds It suggests the design of constructionist computational games that integrate design and programming into the gameplay, aiming to engage students with computational practices in a multidisciplinary, authentic context. It provides an example of a 'design‐to‐play' charades‐like game, developed in a 3D modelling programming environment, that embeds real‐life representations into computational design, to enable 'syntonic learning' of computational practices. Furthermore, it analyses student learning activity to elaborate on arguments and issues related to this approach.Implications for practice and/or policy There is added value in disconnecting computational thinking from positivist diagnostic approaches related to respective concepts and studying it in ways more related to realistic problem‐solving situations and multidisciplinary contexts. The study contributes to the scientific clarification of computational practices concerning how they are being realised and expressed by the students in different contexts through an original example of educational practice. The discussed approach and tools can contribute to the design and development of innovative digital media, embedding affordances for concepts and practices while maintaining relevance and interest for their users.

        "While Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) education is increasingly valued in China, there is little research to understand how science, technology, engineering, and math are best integrated into early childhood education. This study aims to examine Chinese educators' views and perspectives on early technology education – 'the missing T & E in early childhood' – in Shanghai, the largest and the most developed city in China. Altogether, 120 educators were surveyed, including kindergarten principals (N1 = 12), administrators (N2 = 11), and teachers (N3 = 97), and three were also interviewed individually. The results indicated that: (1) most of the Shanghai kindergarten teachers were not literate in information technology; (2) children's development levels, teachers' technological literacy, and limited resources were widely regarded as obstacles to early technology education; and (3) the technology curriculum and digital technology should be carefully designed to cater to young children's needs.

        "Background: A novel pedagogical approach that is becoming increasingly popular in educational contexts is called Gamification. To our knowledge, empirical research on its effectiveness in education is scarse, and almost absent in physical education. Purpose: The goal was to explore how Gamification can be used in physical education, and what experiential effects may have on students and teachers. Participants and settings: Two hundred and ninety students (age range 6–14 years) enrolled in four schools located in four regions of Spain agreed to participate. The study involved five different grades (from year two of primary school to year two of secondary school), and 12 different classes. Four physical education teachers, one from each school, also agreed to participate. All participating classes experienced the same intervention programme: MarvEF [MarvPE], based on the Marvel universe of super heroes. The project lasted 15 weeks, the whole fall semester, for a total of 30 physical education sessions (2 per week/50 min each). Gamification was the basic methodological approach used to design the three consecutive learning units experienced by all the participating students. Research design: The study followed a pre-experimental, one group pre-test-post-test design, where the same dependent variable (intrinsic motivation) is measured in only one group of participants prior and after the intervention. Data collection: A mixed methods approach was followed. It included quantitative information obtained from a questionnaire for the older students (n = 161), and qualitative information extracted from the younger students' drawings (n = 126), discussion groups with the participating teachers (n = 5), and teachers' diary (n = 2). Data analysis: Quantitative data was analysed using the statistical package SPSS (version 22.0). Qualitative data was assessed through content analysis and constant comparison. Findings: Quantitative results showed a significant increase in the students' intrinsic motivation after experiencing Gamification. Students' responses reflected one major theme: enjoyment, and two minor themes: friends and learning. On the other hand, teachers' responses showed three themes: workload, portfolio and narrative. Conclusions: Gamification, implemented on a long-term basis, has been found an instructional framework capable of increasing students' motivation towards physical education, beyond the initial 'novelty effect'. Students enjoyed the different approach, and some, despite their young age (seven-eight years), believed that they have learned (which upgrades the education value of the subject). Four of the five elements identified as central to promote meaningful experiences in physical education and sport appeared in this study (Beni, Fletcher, and Ní Chróinín [2017]. 'Meaningful Experiences in Physical Education and Youth Sport: A Review of the Literature.' Quest (grand Rapids, Mich) 69 (3): 291–312.): social interaction, fun, challenge and learning. Therefore, Gamification has the ingredients to foster significant physical education experiences in different educational levels (primary and secondary education), in students with different social (low, medium and high socio-economic status) and educational backgrounds (urban, rural) and teachers with different expertise on Gamification (novel and experienced). Finally, as expected, teachers showed concern for the workload of the new pedagogical approach. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "In a very short time, secondary school education across the globe transitioned to online learning and teaching, in response to the Covid-19 pandemic. This study aims at identifying teacher profiles in secondary education to better understand perceptions of both individual and institutional readiness to transition to online teaching. To do this, the current study grouped teachers on the basis of their TPACK self-efficacy beliefs, online presence and perceived institutional support for online teaching. To date, data have been collected from teachers (N = 222) from 20 countries. The data were submitted to latent profile analysis to identify readiness profiles. The added value of the current study lies in the combined view of individual and institutional readiness and the uniqueness of the dataset. It provides a large-scale international perspective and a wide range of possible experiences. Findings inform how education institutions can personalise and support transitions to online teaching.

        "The aim of this study was twofold: (a) the design and development of a set of open, interactive, digital Learning Objects (LOs) for high school Physical Education (PE), and (b) the evaluation of the newly-created LOs by PE teachers, experienced both in teaching PE and in Information and Communication Technology (ICT), as to their quality and usefulness, before the dissemination of the use of the LOs in schools. The design and development framework, which was included in an innovative national project, is first presented, followed by descriptions of the 19 LOs that were produced, grouped in two categories (instructivist-oriented and constructivist-oriented LOs). Thirteen (13) of the LOs were subjected to external, summative evaluation by 19 qualified PE teachers, each of whom evaluated all 13 LOs through completing an online evaluation form for each. The form consisted of a standard LO evaluation instrument comprising 4 criteria of quality (interactivity, design, engagement, usability), and of an additional item assessing the usefulness of the LO in the teaching of PE. The LOs were found to be adequate in terms of interactivity, design, engagement, usability and usefulness, which corroborates their suitability for use in schools. Instructivist-oriented LOs and constructivist-oriented LOs were not found to differ significantly in terms of design and usability. However, the latter were found to be significantly more interactive, engaging, and useful in PE teaching than the former. The study provides useful guidance for the future design and development of LOs for PE. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "The appearance of tablet technology in the classroom is considered an obvious modernisation milestone. In the last few years school professionals in Poland have made large investments in digitalisation, especially through one to one model (1:1), using digital devices such as tablets. Researches on tablet technology integration in school classrooms convince that digital technologies are closely related to the discourse of educational change. What really changes when digital technology is used in the classroom? This is a driving question for the present study. This research contributes knowledge and new insights into learning and teaching practices in two classrooms in a Polish primary school that were observed over a longer perspective of three school semesters. The design of teaching and learning with tablet technology was explored using the didactical design framework. This perspective focuses on both teachers' practices and students' learning activities in the classroom and how tablet technology is integrated into teaching and learning practices. Although the research project was performed on a small scale, it can be defined as one that documents the changes to learning and teaching practices happening in the traditional educational culture of the school under analysis. These changes were identified through the data collected by means of classroom video ethnography (63 teaching hours of recording) and follow-up interviews (18) with classroom's teachers. The analysis resulted in three distinct maps of emergent teaching and learning practices and a series of conflicts and tensions teachers experience in their everyday tablet-mediated teaching practices. The findings point out that tablet technology integration needs the alignment of the classroom pedagogy - technology relationships. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "This study examines Grade 9 students' mathematics achievement and cognitive engagement under three different instructional approaches: traditional learning, flipped learning with gamification, and online independent study with gamification. The duration of the study lasted an entire school year. The central theories underpinning flipped learning with gamification design were based on the first principles of Instruction and self-determination theory. A mixed methods approach was used with quantitative (i.e., tests and an optional assignment) and qualitative (i.e., student interviews) methods applied. The test results indicate that students in the flipped class (n = 28) significantly outperformed those in the traditional (n = 27) and online independent study (n = 21) classes. In addition, flipped learning with gamification promoted students' cognitive engagement better than the other two approaches. The findings of student interviews suggest that peer interactions inside the flipped classroom were critical to promoting students' mathematics achievement and cognitive engagement, as opposed to online learning resources and gamification per se. In future practice, teachers can ground their flipped classroom design in the theoretical framework proposed in this study. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "The effective teaching of the concept of programming, where critical thinking is an important factor, is not so easy in secondary education. New teaching approaches, including, game-based learning, may provide a solution due to their inclusion of more fun and diverse activities but they still lack the active participation of the students in the creation of the material. In this context, we develop new teaching and learning materials to teach programming principles, like conditionals, loops and variables, to secondary education students based mainly on the constructivistic philosophy. The aim is to help students learn the basics of programming though creating games using a block-type programming environment and not only through the use and the playing of games. This approach combines the use of game design and creation with learning and results to the developing of basic programming skills. In order to evaluate the produced material quantitative and qualitative methods, such as questionnaires, classroom observations and discussions have been used. The results depict an improvement of the students' knowledge and skills in programming through this game creation process. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "The purposes of this study were twofold: (1) determine the level of digital competence that Spanish teachers have in the use of technological devices, Web 2.0 general tools and Web 2.0 music tools, according to the proficiency profiles established by the European Framework DigCompEdu; and (2) identify the significant predictors which affect Spanish teachers who have a high level of competence. The study uses an ex-post facto design with 115 Spanish secondary school music teachers. The results showed that teachers had a profile between Novice and Expert regarding the use of educational technology. In addition, age, attitude towards ICT and motivation in teaching practice are predictive variables that help predict high competence in the use of Web 2.0 general resources and technological devices in the classroom, while having studied at a conservatory and working as a teacher in a conservatory significantly influence the use of Web 2.0 music tools.

        "This paper examines the incorporation of new literacies to an adapted framework by Parsons et al. in Journal of Computers, 2(4), 1-8, (2007) to design mobile learning applications for \"Elements of Business Skills (EBS)\" for a group of lower academic ability secondary school learners in Singapore. Accounts of the actual process of designing a mobile learning application for teaching and learning are used to consider factors in incorporating new literacies into the modified mobile learning design framework based on mobile learning design principles. The suggested framework incorporating mobile learning and new literacies looks at the interaction dimension, individual learning needs and collective learning for mobile learning through these four perspectives: generic mobile environment issues, learning contexts, learning experiences, and learning objectives. The accounts of the app development process highlight how new literacies come into play when enhancing learning through blending text, sound and imagery, and how app users underscore the importance of mobility and ubiquity for anywhere and anytime continuous, on-the-go learning in terms of the dimensions of new literacies. This paper contributes to the ever evolving and dynamic field of designing future mobile learning systems for the twenty-first century, in a new seamless learning environment.

        "The author is Teaching and Learning Manager at the college with rsponsibility for observation of all teaching staff and their professional development. This research looks at differing concepts of pedagogy through an investigation of observation data and an analysis of 'blended learning sessions' at a college that is at the forefront of using technology as a tool for learning. Located in South Central England this is a relatively small vocational college with two sites in Hampshire. The observation data collected was analysed using the concepts of Pedagogical Content Knowledge (PCK), Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPCK), Signature Pedagogies and expansive vocational education to see how these concepts applied to practice. The conclusion shows that whilst there were differences in the pedagogical content approach, the concept of signature pedagogies was strong across all the curriculum areas looked at. It also highlights the possibility of further international research into post compulsory online learning using this college as an example of good practice. Finally, it observes that the college has the capacity in terms of a dedicated team of technologists to really improve the TPCK of the teachers further, together with a comprehensive digital strategy that encompasses a coherent and planned curriculum using 'joined up' schemes of work. In this way the PCK and the TPCK of teachers will be strengthened. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "In Hong Kong, the principle of 'one curriculum framework for all' applies to all students, including students with special educational needs (SEN) (EDB 2020. \"Special Education Needs.\" ). Students with intellectual disabilities (ID) are expected to achieve the same learning targets as their counterparts in mainstream schools. Within this common curriculum framework, students (age 6–14) study Music with one of its overall aims 'to develop creativity' (CDC 2003. Music Curriculum Guide (Primary 1 – Secondary 3). Hong Kong: CDC, 11). This qualitative multiple case study reports a sample of nine music teachers fostering the musical creativity of students with ID. A discussion of the findings reveals that in this sampling: (1) instructional strategies focus on the process not product of musical creativity, (2) creative fostering strategies embody gamification and (3) these music teachers re-frame creativity as being innate and commonly held by their students with ID.

        "DALDIS is a three-year EU-funded Erasmus+ Project on Digital Assessment for Learning (2019–2022) involving five European countries. DALDIS is pilot testing a digital assessment for learning solution focused on Science and Modern Foreign Language Learning in years 5–9. Underpinned by the Study Quest technology, which is designed to drive students' learning progression using well-designed question-sets and student feedback, DALDIS is built on the principle that formative assessment is one of the best methods to encourage student achievement. Although Assessment for Learning (AFL) using technology has great potential for learning, it is not widely used in Europe. As the project lead Ireland was responsible for the first adaptation of StudyQuest, known as JCQuest for its Junior Cycle science and French curriculum. Unexpectedly, the commencement of DALDIS coincided with school closures due to Covid-19 and this appears to have influenced the uptake in student usage of JCQuest to support online learning and exam preparation. This paper provides an insight into how students engaged with JCQuest, key usage patterns and types of devices used based on Google Analytics data during two crucial school closure periods during Ireland's pandemic.

        "This study utilizing a sequential explanatory mixed-methods design explored the impact of mobile-based dynamic assessment (MDA) on EFL learners' writing skills. Three intact classes (N = 30), including intermediate EFL learners attending a private English language school in Iran, participated in this study. They were evenly divided into two experimental and one control groups. The DIALNG online diagnostic test was used to assess the participants' written proficiency and also as an instrument to collect the pre-and post-test scores. During the treatment sessions, the students were required to complete writing tasks over their Google Docs mobile app shared with the instructor. She provided text- and voice-based mediations to the experimental groups following an interactionist DA using both WhatsApp and Google Docs. Follow-up interviews were conducted to assess the experimental groups' perceptions towards each mediation type. T-test and ANOVA along with the thematic analysis were used to analyze the quantitative and qualitative data, respectively. The findings showed that only the text group's post-test scores significantly improved and there was a significant difference among the three groups in their post-test scores which indicated outperformance of the voice group. The overall results showed that MDA enhances EFL learners' written proficiency as a result of the collaborations between the learners and the instructor using text and voice-based mediation. The thematic analysis of data revealed the participants' satisfaction with both mediation types in terms of being efficient, convenient, and causing less social pressure. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

There has not been any recent effort to synthesize or critically analyse the systematic reviews in the area of educational technology. This study analysed 73 systematic literature reviews, including meta‐analyses, focused on the evaluation of technology in educational contexts, in order to holistically understand the impact of learning technology use across different aspects of evaluation. Among these reviews, the most common theme examined was learning outcomes (89%), followed by affective elements (45%), behaviours (25%), technological elements (21%) and teaching/pedagogical aspects (19%). Most of the reviews found that the use of technology improved learning outcomes and affective perceptions. Approaches involving interaction, gamification, constructivism, student‐centred learning and feedback were most effective. The analysis highlighted the need for more reviews focusing on multiple aspects of learning technology evaluation, on school level education and on the use of technology in naturalistic (non‐interventional) settings. Critical reflections are also cast on the methods used to conduct systematic reviews in the educational technology field. Lay Description: What is already known about this topic Systematic literature reviews are often used to understand trends in specific areas of educational technology research and evaluation.There has not been any recent effort to synthesis or critically analyse the reviews in areas of educational technology research. What this paper adds A critical analysis of 73 systematic reviews to understand trends in learning technology evaluation.Technology use consistently improves outcomes across reviews of different learning domains, technologies, and levels.Approaches involving interaction, gamification, constructivism, student‐centred learning and feedback were most effective.The majority of systematic reviews did not evaluate the quality of the primary papers which they examined. Implications of study findings for practitioners Educators should preference approaches that are constructivist, social, gamified, student‐centred and involving feedback.Educators should strive to evaluate the quality of the papers they review as well as multiple aspects of learning.The more detailed findings of this paper will enable educators to adopt a more nuanced approach to their practice.

        "Digital game‐based learning (DGBL) is a frequently adopted mode for facilitating teaching and learning, where learners are immersed in game contexts to engage in gameplay and to construct meaningful knowledge. However, without guidance, students might have difficulties organizing what they have experienced in gaming contexts. Thus, in this research, a multidimensional repertory grid (MDRG) approach was proposed, and a digital game was implemented accordingly. Moreover, an experiment was executed in a geography course to examine the effectiveness of the strategy. A total of 83 high school students (15.5 years old on average) participated in the experiment. The experimental group learned with the multidimensional repertory grid‐based educational game, while the control group learned with the conventional gaming mode. The analysis results revealed that the experimental group had better learning achievement as well as higher learning motivation, self‐efficacy and metacognition awareness. In addition, the behavioral analysis and interview results revealed that those learning with the proposed strategy had a greater tendency to promote higher order thinking. Accordingly, the limitations and suggestions for future research are provided. Practitioner NotesWhat is already known about this topic Digital game‐based learning is an effective teaching approach that enables learners to effectively acquire knowledge in joyful contexts, hence enhancing their learning achievement and learning motivation.Suitable strategies should be embedded in games to enable students to have a higher level of thinking ability and to improve their academic performance.In view of guiding students to observe from multi‐dimensional perspectives, a repertory grid is believed to be a suitable tool since it enables students to observe different learning objects according to different aspects and elements.What this paper adds A multi‐dimensional repertory grid‐based educational game (MDRG game) was developed to facilitate students' learning achievement, learning motivation, and self‐efficacy as well as their metacognition awareness.In addition to promoting students' learning outcomes, students' learning behavioral transition diagrams were presented and interview results were analyzed in this study.Implications for practice and/or policy Traditional graphs or tables could help students memorize and understand features of learning objects; however, it is not easy to promote students' higher order thinking skills of making comparisons and reflections from multiple dimensions.The multi‐dimensional repertory grid‐based feedback provides students with systematically organized information to make comparisons and reflections, which furthermore enhances students' higher order thinking competences.Embedding suitable strategies (e.g., multi‐dimensional repertory grid‐based feedback) in games can effectively improve students' learning performance without increasing their cognitive load.

        "There is a wide diversity of views on the potential for artificial intelligence (AI), ranging from overenthusiastic pronouncements about how it is imminently going to transform our lives to alarmist predictions about how it is going to cause everything from mass unemployment to the destruction of life as we know it. In this article, I look at the practicalities of AI in education and at the attendant ethical issues it raises. My key conclusion is that AI in the near- to medium-term future has the potential to enrich student learning and complement the work of (human) teachers without dispensing with them. In addition, AI should increasingly enable such traditional divides as ‘school versus home’ to be straddled with regard to learning. AI offers the hope of increasing personalization in education, but it is accompanied by risks of learning becoming less social. There is much that we can learn from previous introductions of new technologies in school to help maximize the likelihood that AI can help students both to flourish and to learn powerful knowledge. Looking further ahead, AI has the potential to be transformative in education, and it may be that such benefits will first be seen for students with special educational needs. This is to be welcomed.

        "The COVID-19 pandemic has made online and distance learning the new normal at all levels of education. Music as a school subject that relies heavily on multimodal sensory and auditory-motor interactions has been dramatically affected. Music teachers may not be coping mentally or psychologically with these drastic changes. This study examined the psychological impact of COVID-19 on music teachers' (N = 120) mental health and well-being through a questionnaire survey and semi-structured interviews (n = 10). The Fear of Coronavirus-19 Scale, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale and a shortened version of the Chinese Teacher Stress Questionnaire were used to measure Hong Kong music teachers' experiences of psychological pressure and problem behaviours linked to the outbreak of the infectious disease. The findings revealed that music teachers are experiencing stress, fear, and anxiety in response to the pandemic. They are concerned about the effectiveness of online music teaching, parental expectations, students' adaptability to online learning, technological integration and maintaining transformative teaching professionalism.

        "On 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization upgraded the outbreak of COVID-19 to pandemic status. On 15 March 2020, the South African president declared a national state of disaster under the Disaster Management Act of 2002. On 26 March 2020, national lockdown, which included measures stipulated in guidelines for education in emergencies, was implemented in South Africa. The presidential declaration and subsequent lockdown came at a time when some of the universities in South Africa were already struggling either to commence the academic year, or to make up for time lost due to persistent student protests relating to several student demands. However, disaster management now entailed that all schools and institutions of higher education were forced to close immediately for extended periods, necessitating alternative ways of ensuring access to education. The qualitative case study presented in this article sought to document the intervention strategies developed by two universities located in remote parts of Eastern Cape Province to deliver education during the COVID-19 restrictions. A second aim was an examination of the challenges experienced by the two institutions' largely rural student population. The authors collected data using a questionnaire completed by 15 educators and 30 students from the two universities. They also analysed official communications documents from the universities addressed to lecturers and students. The results indicate that access to online teaching and learning platforms and resources for students from poor rural communities in South Africa is challenging, and that there are gross inequalities in educational outcomes for learners from different socio-economic backgrounds. This affects the future plans of higher education institutions to provide teaching and learning through online-based platforms. The authors conclude their article by providing recommendations to support online learning in rural areas, which has the potential to expand higher education access post-COVID-19.

        "Résumé: L'éducation dans les situations d'urgence : les leçons de la COVID-19 en Afrique du Sud – Le 11 mars 2020, l'Organisation mondiale de la santé a fait passer la COVID-19 du statut d'épidémie à celui de pandémie. Le 15 mars 2020, le président sud-africain a déclaré l'état de catastrophe nationale conformément à la Loi de gestion des catastrophes de 2002. Le 26 mars 2020, un confinement national est entré en vigueur en Afrique du Sud. Il comportait des mesures conformes aux directives concernant l'éducation dans les situations d'urgence. La déclaration du président et le confinement qui a suivi sont arrivés à un moment où un certain nombre d'universités sud-africaines se battaient déjà soit pour entamer l'année universitaire, soit pour rattraper le temps perdu en raison des manifestations estudiantines persistantes liées à différentes revendications. Toutefois, la gestion de catastrophe a obligé toutes les écoles et tous les établissements d'enseignement supérieur à fermer immédiatement pour des périodes prolongées, une situation qui nécessitait de proposer d'autres solutions pour garantir l'accès à l'éducation. L'étude de cas qualitative présentée dans cet article avait pour vocation de documenter les stratégies d'intervention mises en œuvre par deux universités situées dans des régions reculées de la province d'Eastern Cape pour poursuivre leur mission d'enseignement pendant la période de restrictions imposées par la COVID-19. Elle se proposait également d'examiner les défis qui s'étaient posés aux étudiants de ces deux établissements, essentiellement issus de zones rurales. Les auteurs ont recueilli des données grâce à un questionnaire auquel ont répondu 15 enseignants et 30 étudiants de deux universités. Ils ont aussi analysé les documents de communication officiels des universités adressés aux maîtres de conférences et aux étudiants. Les résultats indiquent que l'accès à l'enseignement en ligne et aux plateformes et ressources d'apprentissage pour les étudiants de communes rurales pauvres d'Afrique du Sud est difficile, et que les résultats des apprenants sont très inégaux en fonction de leur milieu socio-économique. Ceci influera sur les plans à venir que les établissements d'enseignement supérieur développeront en matière d'enseignement et d'apprentissage pour les plateformes en ligne. Les auteurs concluent leur article en recommandant de soutenir un apprentissage en ligne susceptible d'élargir l'accès à l'enseignement supérieur après la crise de la COVID-19 dans les zones rurales.

        "Motivation is a key factor in predicting K‐12 students' online learning success. Drawing on self‐determination theory, this study used a person‐centered approach to identify the motivational profiles of students taking online high school language courses, and to examine such profiles' relationships to their learning outcomes, genders and reasons for enrollment. Cluster analysis of 466 students revealed the existence of four profiles: high and low quantity, and good and poor quality. Students in the high‐quantity profile demonstrated comparable learning outcomes to those in the good quality profile; and there was significant gender and enrollment reason differences across the four motivational profiles. Practitioner NotesWhat is already known about this topic Motivation is of considerable importance to the success of online learning.Autonomous motivation is more adaptive than controlled motivation.Most studies have used a variable‐centered approach to investigating the unique and independent roles of motivation types in online learning.What this paper adds This study is believed to be the first to use a person‐centered approach to identify motivational profiles (ie, good quality, high quantity, low quantity and poor quality) among virtual‐school students taking foreign‐language courses.It confirms the positive effect of autonomous motivation on learning, and extends exploration of this effect to online learning.Students in the high‐quantity profile achieved comparable learning outcomes to those in the good quality profile.Females were overrepresented in the good quality profile (ie, more females than would be expected by chance).Motivational profiles differed significantly across enrollment reasons (ie, credit recovery, elective or requirement).Implications for practice and/or policy Teachers should not simply place each student in a box as having either autonomous or controlled motivation.Online learning content and activities should be designed in ways that promote autonomous motivation.Online educators need to be aware of potential gender and enrollment reason effects on students' motivations.

        "This article uses an anonymous 2014–15 school year dataset from the Directorate-General for Statistics of Education and Science (DGEEC) of the Portuguese Ministry of Education as a means to carry out a predictive power comparison between the classic multilinear regression model and a chosen set of machine learning algorithms. A multilinear regression model is used in parallel with random forest, support vector machine, artificial neural network and extreme gradient boosting machine stacking ensemble implementations. Designing a hybrid analysis is intended where classical statistical analysis and artificial intelligence algorithms are blended to augment the ability to retain valuable conclusions and well-supported results. The machine learning algorithms attain a higher level of predictive ability. In addition, the stacking appropriateness increases as the base learner output correlation matrix determinant increases and the random forest feature importance empirical distributions are correlated with the structure of p-values and the statistical significance test ascertains of the multiple linear model. An information system that supports the nationwide education system should be designed and further structured to collect meaningful and precise data about the full range of academic achievement antecedents. The article concludes that no evidence is found in favour of smaller classes. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "Moodle represents a great contribution to the educational world since it provides an evolving platform for Virtual Learning Management Systems (VLMS) that became a standard de facto for most of the educational institutions around the world. Through the pedagogical functions provided, it collects in the many globally spread out databases a huge amount of information regarding the activities that teachers and students perform during the learning process. This reality makes Moodle a natural choice for conducting experimental research by Artificial Intelligence researchers interested in theories for improving learning and teaching; particularly those related with the controversial learning styles concept. Roughly defined, a learning style intends to be a model of the way and media an apprentice acquires knowledge and hence the way a teacher should present that knowledge to the apprentice matching his/her learning style. Independently of the many controversies (be these scientific, psychological or even ethical) about the soundness and real outcomes that such ideas can bring to improve learning, it's a worthy intriguing research area for many researchers pursuing the ideal automated teacher: the teachbot dream. Behind this goal we have developed Middle, a Moodle plug-in able to infer the learning style of each student taking a course using an advanced version of a Bayesian network model that we previously tested. Middle intends support personalized teaching based on the Felder-Silverman's ILS model and has been evaluated through controlled experiments and pilot test in high schools and university courses. Such experiments showed promising results that shed some light on learning styles modeling and its potential outcomes. During the experience we found strong limitations in the Moodle design regarding its supposed flexibility to incorporate new functionalities. From a strict software architecture point of view, we found that such flexibility is far from being enough to easier the implementation of the dynamic computational behavior required to support a teachbot. This made our effort much harder than expected, perhaps because of the illusion induced by the widespread use of Moodle. In this article we present our results and experiences extending Moddle with intelligent behavior from a software architecture point of view, focusing on the lessons learnt in such extension. Our experience indicates that this simplicity is far from being so and hence it is worth to share the limitations and how we overcome them. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "As mobile devices become more ubiquitous, the benefits of mobile learning (m-learning) can be a great opportunity for educating a vast populace, especially in developing countries. Acceptance of m-learning by individuals is critical for these nations while aiming for a successful implementation of m-learning. A total of 1156 middle and high school students in Indonesia participated in this study to investigate factors determining m-learning acceptance among adolescents and to discover the effects of sex, age group, and location differences with the technology acceptance model (TAM) as a theoretical framework. The results indicate that all seven factors in the model are significant determinants of m-learning acceptance with some moderation effects by sex, age, and location differences at play. While the literature showed the importance of perceived usefulness in technology acceptance, including in the m-learning case, this study found that its effect is far less influential than perceived enjoyment and social influence, inferring the irrationality of adolescents in their intention of using m-learning. Perceived mobility value and perceived usefulness, while showing much smaller effects than shown in the literature, are still influential in m-learning acceptance, especially for female and high school students and not necessarily for male and middle school students. Meanwhile, facilitating conditions are crucial in helping female, middle school students, and students in rural areas adopt m-learning. This study helps understand unique characteristics of adolescents as a younger generation that separate them from adults when it comes to their acceptance of m-learning. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "The school closures during the COVID-19 outbreak triggered ashift towards digital learning. Whilst this is amajor challenge for mainstream education, the implementation of digital learning poses an even bigger challenge for special education teachers, as they are confronted with different learning requirements which might hinder digital learning processes. Previous research identified obstacles to digital learning in mainstream education, but conditions of digital learning in special education remain unclear. This article aims to provide insights on conditions of digital learning in special education at teacher-, school-, and student-levels. We examined whether the intention to use digital learning in special education is predicted by (1) teachers' self-efficacy, attitudes and their perceived usability of digital learning, (2) perceived organisational support and (3) perceived obstacles on student-level. Data of N = 722 special education teachers were collected during the pandemic. Results of mixed models indicate that specific self-efficacy in digital learning and perceived support were the strongest predictors for the intention to use digital learning, while alack of students' self-regulation and parental support represented major obstacles. The results underline the need for specific training in digital learning for special education teachers, and interventions in digital learning for students with special needs.

        "With increased accessibility to digital video equipment, there has been notable interest in exploring how this might support practice and pedagogy across many education sectors. In recent years video has been found to offer many opportunities to study and support teacher professional development. This paper examines the potential for digital observation within initial teacher education (ITE), specifically as a tool for engaging pre-service teachers in reflective practice during school placement. The study included pre-service primary teachers in the largest teacher education centre in Ireland. A treatment group (n = 15) completed their compulsory written reflections as normal during school placement but were also provided with Swivl digital technology in order to record and reflect on their lessons using video footage. A control group (n = 20) completed their traditional written reflections as normal without the use of the digital technology. Upon the completion of school placement, in-depth qualitative interviews with both treatment and control groups (N = 35) examined experiences in using digital technologies in the classroom, and the critical reflection of their lessons during school placement. The analysis provides strong evidence that the digital video footage was highly supportive in pre-service teachers' weekly self-reflection and in developing their self-reflective practice. They reflected on embodied and non-embodied aspects of their teaching, in the process revising their habitus as a teacher. The richness of the data provides new evidence on the potential for video technology to support teacher professional development internationally. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "We examined the professional practice of a teacher-researcher who introduced a pedagogical decision-making process using local multi-source data in a professional learning community. Through a written and thematic approach, the analysis revealed seven contributing elements related to the implementation process of a pedagogical decision-making practice: members' mobilisation around a common goal, acquisition of a common language, interpersonal relations skills, members' self-training, differentiated implementation, reflection, and the members' paradoxical relationship with technological tools. Theoretical and practical outcomes are discussed. •The teacher-researcher developed a pedagogical decision-making process in the context of a professional learning community. •Data accessible or produced in schools are valued in this process. •The teacher-researcher's reflective analysis identified seven elements for implementing this pedagogical decision-making process. •Advanced analytics and artificial intelligence will improve this process in the future. • This study provides relevant avenues for action to improve PLC effectiveness [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "This article reports a two-phase study with (1) an extended framework on mobile learning technology acceptance, and (2) a mixed-method research investigating college students on the use and embracement of mobile learning technology acceptance in Saudi Arabia. The research extended the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) framework with constructs particularly concerning mobile learning technology. The sequential mixed-method study investigated college students' mobile learning technology acceptance in Saudi Arabia, and also validated the extended framework with empirical data. A total of 1203 eligible college students, 591 male and 612 females, participated in the online survey, and 15 of them also participated in individual interviews afterward. A wide range of social media and social networking sites were used to recruit participants and collect data. The study found that variables like Learning Expectancy (LE), Effort Expectancy (EE), Social Influence (SI), and characteristics of mobile learning were significant predictors of students' intentions to use mobile learning technologies, regardless of the moderating effects of gender, age, and eLearning experience. Social influence was the only construct that was found as moderated by gender, where men showed a stronger behavioral intention to use mobile learning technology than women. Facilitating Conditions (FC) and Self-Management of Mobile Learning (SMML) in this study were not significant in predicting students' behavioral intention or their use behavior of mobile learning technology acceptance.

        "The past 40 years have been characterized by an ongoing shift in the rationale underlying the use of educational technologies – an earlier emphasis on efficiency and engagement has been overshadowed by a vision centered on educational technologies' capacity to facilitate authentic learning in the inauthentic school context. However, despite its intuitive appeal, authenticity is a vague and contestable concept that warrants further scrutiny. Accordingly, this theoretical paper sets out to offer a conceptual analysis of the various meanings of authenticity in educational discourse, and to examine how these both shape and obfuscate arguments concerning educational technologies. To do so, I identify two key ambiguities inherent in the concept of authenticity: (1) whether authenticity relies on correspondence to real-world contexts (is), or aims to tap into a deeper essence of an individual or phenomenon (ought); (2) whether authenticity is mainly viewed from a supposedly objective perspective (external), or aims to capture individuals' subjective experiences (internal). The depiction of technology as authentic, along with the conflations between its various meanings, serve to naturalize existing patterns of technology use, while obscuring the ways in which they are shaped by social, political and pedagogical considerations that should remain open to evaluation and critique.

        "For many young children in developed countries, family and community life is mediated by digital technology. Despite this, for early years educators, the process of integrating digital technologies into classroom practice raises a number of issues and tensions. In an attempt to gain insights from early years teachers, we draw from semi-structured interview data from ten practising teachers which explored their perspectives on digital technologies within their personal and professional lives, and of children's use of digital technologies within and outside educational settings. Our analysis builds on previous work that suggests that teachers draw on multiple discourses related to conceptualisations of childhood when thinking about digital technology and young children. In this paper we contribute to these discussions, drawing specifically on examples from the data where teachers articulate their understandings of children's use of digital technology where this relates directly to children's literacy practices. We assert that narrow conceptualized notions of literacy, compounded by national imperatives to raise print literacy standards, add another layer of discursive complexity that comes to the fore when teachers are asked to provide a rationale for the promotion of digital literacies in early years classrooms. A broader framing of literacy therefore, is needed if the potential of digital technologies in the early years is to be realized. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "We explored whether problem‐solving interactivity within an instructional game fosters learning for children aged 8–10 years. Participants (N = 139) studied a biological topic either through a game‐based learning environment (in which they solved assigned problems by interacting with a plant model) or from a standard learning environment (in which they observed how the problems were solved in an animation) (i.e., between‐subject design). The treatments were equal with regard to learning content and guidance. No between‐group differences in learning outcomes were detected (comprehension: d = 0.16; transfer: d = −0.01). Self‐rating of enjoyment tended to be higher in the game group (d = 0.32), and when the children could choose between the treatments in a free‐choice period, they strongly preferred the interactive game (87.5%). The results suggest that both the interactive and the non‐interactive treatments are useful, but their applicability may differ depending on the learning context (e.g., school vs. home).

        "Lay Description: What is already known about this topic: Problem‐solving interactivity can be implemented within game‐based learning environments.Little is known about whether problem‐solving interactivity within these environments improves or harms learning (especially with regard to children). What this paper adds: Children (Grade 3–4) strongly prefer an interactive game (in which they interact in order to solve assigned problems) compared with a non‐interactive learning environment (in which they observe how the problems are solved in an animation).The game, implementing problem‐solving interactivity, neither improves nor harms learning compared with the non‐interactive learning environment. Implications for practice: The results favour non‐interactive (and cheaper) interventions in settings where children cannot choose learning materials (e.g., in schools), but interactive ones when they can choose (e.g., home learning).

        "Digital technology is a central part of young children's everyday lives in most societies today. This paper contributes to current research by exploring two teachers' pedagogical strategies when creating digital stories together with groups of six kindergarten children (age 4–5). The study has a qualitative, multiple-case study design. The analysis was performed inductively across the two cases. The findings show that when creating digital stories with young children, teachers' various pedagogical strategies are equally important for the process and product: Inviting to dialogue, Explaining the practical, and Instructing for results. An encouraging tone characterises the teachers' communication. The research findings contribute to knowledge of how teachers involve groups of children in technology-mediated story creation processes by highlighting the pedagogical perspectives when using digital technology.

        "Sex and sexual health remain taboo topics in Bhutan. Sexually Transmissible Infections (STIs) are still associated with social stigma, embarrassment and denial, and knowledge of sexual health among young people does not equate to safer practice. This study employed longitudinal survey method to explore the level of trainee teachers' knowledge, attitudes and practices about sex and sexual health at the beginning (2015 – baseline) and end (2018 – post-intervention) of a four-year training programme delivered in the two teacher training colleges in Bhutan. Data were collected using a self-administered survey questionnaire (baseline, n = 380 and post-intervention, n = 350) focused on knowledge about sex and sexual health, attitudes towards sex and sexual health, and sex and sexual health behaviour/practices of the trainee teachers. Findings showed an overall general improvement in students' knowledge, attitudes and practices after the introduction of a compulsory non-credited comprehensive sexuality education (CSE) module, the organisation of seminars, and the provision of health talks. However, there remain opportunities for further improvement. These include a further review of the CSE module, increased use of digital technology, and enhanced attention to social media. Findings have implications for a wide range of college students, not only trainee teachers, and not only for future work in Bhutan. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "The Covid-19 pandemic resulted in New Zealand schools closing and teaching occurring through digital media. This article reports research which applied Kearney et al.'s framework as a lens to examine student experience of digital learning at home during Covid-19. This framework provides three characteristics that influence learners' experience when using digital devices for learning: personalisation, authenticity and collaboration. High school students in their final two years of schooling (n = 1975) responded to a questionnaire consisting of quantitative and qualitative questions, with qualitative data analysed thematically and quantitative data with descriptive statistics. Aspects of Kearney et al.'s framework were reflected in participants' experience, but further characteristics were identified. Authenticity and collaboration facilitated learning, but participants valued supportive pedagogies and motivational strategies which enabled academic progress and enhanced wellbeing. Effective use of technology mediated supportive pedagogies, and an alternative framework was developed to incorporate these additional findings. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "This interdisciplinary research examines how Informal Digital Learning of English (IDLE) and the L2 Motivational Self System (consisting of the ideal L2 self and the ought‐to L2 self) are linked with Foreign Language Enjoyment (FLE). Together, these are flourishing research areas in computer‐assisted language learning, second language acquisition and positive psychology. Using a purposive sampling technique, three cohorts of English‐as‐a‐foreign‐language learners (N = 661) are surveyed in South Korea: middle school (n = 173), high school (n = 374) and university students (n = 114). Results of hierarchical regression analyses show that IDLE and the ideal L2 self are significantly predictive of all groups' FLE, while the ought‐to L2 self predicts only middle school students' FLE. These results suggest that students' engagement in extramural digital activities and their motivational mindset (shaped through different socio‐educational contexts) may have influenced their emotions in learning their target language. Informed by these results, teachers can help increase students' L2 learning enjoyment by supporting their language learning in out‐of‐class digital settings as well as promoting their ideal L2 self‐images. Concurrently, teachers and parents can enhance younger learners' enjoyment of learning L2—especially in test‐oriented Asian contexts—by setting higher L2 learning expectations.

        "Globally, Information and Communication Technology (ICT) is regarded as a dependable vehicle for facilitating educational reform and development, a platform for communication, and as a means to achieve the Sustainable Development Goal Four (SDG 4). Since the enactment of the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) and declaration of the SDG 4, many countries have opted to embrace the lifelong education for all by integrating ICT in teaching and learning at all school levels. The Ghanaian Government's initiative to ensure \"education anytime anywhere for everyone\" by revolutionizing teaching and learning through ICT has faced a lot of challenges and criticisms. The main mission of the Ghana ICT for Accelerated Development (ICT4AD) in 2003 was to transform Ghana into an information and technology-driven high-income economy through education, but this goal is yet to be realized. In the wake of the COVID-19 which has forced many countries and educational sectors to adopt online learning, there is a need to discuss the effectiveness of online learning and barriers to online learning in the developing contexts, and how to successfully integrate ICT in schools for online learning, especially rural schools where students' educational careers are in jeopardy because they benefit less from online learning. The paper identifies critical factors that affect online learning, recommends post COVID-19 strategies to promote e-learning for policymakers in education and the government, and concludes with a conceptual model for emergency transition to e-learning.

        "Computer education was an integral part of curriculum development and a priority of the OECD's policy agenda at the turn of the 1970s. Based on an analysis of archival documents, programme overviews and publications, this article describes how the introduction of computers in the classroom was advocated by the OECD and, more specifically, how this fostered the creation of an arena for the production of knowledge. The article sheds light on the OECD as an arena for the pooling and channelling of ideas relating to the uses of school computers. It, therefore, not only fills a gap in the history of educational technology, but also demonstrates how knowledge was catalysed and disseminated by this international governmental organisation. Furthermore, the study analyses an attempt to intervene in national policy-making that was withdrawn before it was implemented. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "It is important that educators create a good basis for young students to develop their digital competence. This two-year case study aimed to find ways to foster the digital competence of young students in the early years of primary school education. The results show that spontaneous problems provided opportunities for students to show their competence and fostered their engagement. In addition, long-lasting changes were associated with learning digital competence at the beginning of primary school. Furthermore, all children were eager in using digital technology for learning, but their commitment in tracking their own development and using digital technology to make their learning transparent to homes varied. This study shows that when fostering young students' evolving digital competence, teachers need to consider digital technology use holistically and in long-term. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "In today's classrooms, digital technologies and digital media enable an unlimited number of learning resources. Digital tools are one type of digital technology used in pedagogical settings. By digital tools we mean software that is not produced for educational purposes, but which may be used to support learning. Using theoretical concepts from Basil Bernstein and analytical tools from Critical Discourse Studies, the paper provides an in-depth critical analysis of two digital tools that are free of charge and recommended for teaching Physical Education in upper secondary schools in Denmark. The main intention is to discuss the educational problems related to the use of digital tools as learning resources and especially to challenge the idea that they are \"for free\".

        "This study examines whether online teacher professional development (OTPD), in the form of an interactive webinar series that encourages collaborative learning, improves student achievement. We conducted a randomised controlled trial with 1102 students, 45 teachers and 30 secondary schools in Flanders, Belgium. As a basis for the study, we developed a digital learning path aimed at improving student scores on financial literacy–a multidimensional key competence recently integrated into the curriculum. We demonstrate that the learning path improves student learning outcomes and that enhanced teacher involvement in this programme does not increase learning outcomes unless the teachers participate in the OTPD initiative. Teacher engagement in the webinar series generated student learning outcomes 0.39 standard deviations higher than those of students whose teachers did not receive this intervention, thus, confirming the effectiveness of the OTPD initiative. This effect was found immediately after programme implementation, and it persisted until at least 6 weeks later. As an underlying mechanism, we observe that engagement in the webinar series enhances teachers' self‐efficacy. Classroom observations suggest that engagement increases the frequency of providing students with content‐related help. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "The COVID-19 pandemic has led to extraordinary changes in family literacy instruction, forcing face-to-face programmes to shift rapidly (or \"on the fly\") to online, remote instruction. This study is one of the few on online teaching and learning in family literacy and, to the knowledge of the authors, the first on emergency remote instruction in a family literacy programme during the COVID-19 pandemic. This article examines how the Goodling Institute for Research in Family Literacy at The Pennsylvania State University in the United States has responded to the pandemic by converting its face-to-face family literacy classes into emergency remote instruction using online platforms. Serving eight immigrant families in 2019–2020 who live in the State College area in central Pennsylvania, the Family Pathways programme includes adult education, parent education and interactive parent–child literacy activities. The article discusses how teachers created online learning opportunities for parents and children to learn together, the strategies and resources instructors used to teach remotely, how challenges such as discomfort with technology were addressed, and what has been learned from the experience. Although COVID-19 presents unprecedented challenges for educators and learners in family literacy programmes more broadly, it has also compelled instructors in this particular programme to use remote instruction creatively and has revealed the critical importance of family literacy programmes as an educational support system for low-income and immigrant families.

        "Résumé: À la volée : adaptation rapide à l'urgence du télé-enseignement dans le cadre d'un programme d'alphabétisation familiale – La pandémie de COVID 19 a entraîné des changements extraordinaires en matière d'alphabétisation familiale, contraignant les programmes en présentiel à passer rapidement (pour ainsi dire, à la volée) à un mode d'enseignement à distance en ligne. Cette étude est l'une des rares à aborder l'enseignement et l'apprentissage en ligne en matière d'alphabétisation et, à la connaissance des auteures, elle est la première qui porte sur l'enseignement à distance dans le cadre d'un programme d'alphabétisation familiale durant la pandémie de COVID-19. Le présent article se penche sur la réponse que l'Institut Goodling de recherche en alphabétisation familiale de la Pennsylvania State University (USA) a apporté à la pandémie en transformant, à chaud, ses cours d'alphabétisation familiale en présentiel en cours à distance par le biais de plateformes en ligne. Le programme Family Pathways, qui accueillait en 2019–2020 huit familles immigrées habitant près de State College, une circonscription administrative dans le centre de la Pennsylvanie, comporte des volets d'éducation des adultes, d'éducation parentale et d'activités interactives d'alphabétisation parents-enfants. Il examine différents aspects de ce programme : comment des enseignants ont élaboré des offres d'apprentissage en ligne pour permettre aux parents et aux enfants d'apprendre ensemble; les stratégies et ressources utilisées par les enseignants dans leurs cours à distance; comment les défis, comme le fait d'être mal à l'aise avec la technologie, ont été abordés et quels sont les leçons tirées de cette expérience. Bien que la COVID-19 pose plus globalement des défis sans précédent aux éducateurs et aux apprenants des programmes d'alphabétisation familiale, elle a aussi obligé les enseignants de ce programme particulier à faire un usage créatif du télé-enseignement et révélé l'importance décisive des programmes d'alphabétisation familiale pour offrir un système de soutien éducatif à des familles immigrées et disposant de faibles revenus.

        "Background: Quality physical education (PE) lessons tap on the four focal areas: curriculum, instruction, policies and environment (National Association for Sport and Physical Education 2013. Quality Physical Education NASPE Resource Brief. Reston, VA: American Alliance for Health, Physical Education, Recreation and Dance). One of the approaches to enhance the quality of PE is to use digital technologies, such as the iPad and mobile applications (apps), in the classes to facilitate teachers' instruction and students' learning process. Although literature discussing strategies and different types of apps employed in PE classes is available, studies investigating their effectiveness on students' physical activity (PA) level and their PA-related beliefs are scarce. The national guidelines state that students meet the recommended moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) levels in PE, as children are not sufficiently active in PE classes. Recently, more PE teachers are integrating apps in their classes and, therefore, it is essential to examine whether app-integrated PE is effective in promoting children's PA and PA-related psychosocial beliefs such as enjoyment and self-efficacy. Purpose: The study examined the short-term (two-week) effects of mobile app-integrated PE classes on children's PA and their psychosocial beliefs. Methods: A total of 157 fourth and fifth grade children from two elementary schools in the Midwestern U.S. participated in this study in 2016. Four PE classes from one school (n = 77) served as the app-integrated group, while three classes from the comparison school (n = 80) participated as the traditional PE group. Three PE sessions were measured for both schools at baseline and post-test to examine children's differences in PA levels and psychosocial beliefs. In the app-integrated lessons, teachers used the iPad and mobile apps to instruct during the post-test sessions. Children's percentages of time spent in sedentary behavior, light PA, and MVPA during PE classes were measured via ActiGraph GTX3+ accelerometers. A battery of validated questionnaires were used to assess the children's PA-related psychosocial beliefs (i.e. self-efficacy, outcome expectancy, social support, and enjoyment) in PE. Results: The changes in children's PA were significantly different between the app-integrated and comparison groups in sedentary behavior (F (1,154) = 110.6, p < 0.001, η2 = 0.42), light PA (F (1,154) = 97.7, p < 0.01, η2= 0.39), and MVPA (F (1,154) = 31.4, p <.01, η2= 0.17). Children in both groups demonstrated a decrease in their MVPA; however, the decrease in the app-integrated group was significantly greater than that of the comparison group (−1.6%). There were no significant differences in changes of all beliefs between the two groups. Conclusions: The short-term (two-week) app-integrated PE classes was ineffective in reducing children's sedentary behavior and improving light PA, MVPA, and PA-related beliefs. Teachers are recommended to align the use of iPad and apps with the PE learning goals: selection of apps and pedagogy of app use need to be carefully thought out to prevent compromising children's PA for the sake of efficient management or emphasis on other learning domains.

        "Due to the rapid advancement of technology and its impact on English learning outside of the classroom, Informal Digital Learning of English (IDLE) has grown in popularity among English learners. However, understanding of this emerging phenomenon has been limited to individual characteristics, neglecting the wider environmental contexts that influence IDLE. We analyzed factors influencing one's perceptions or behaviors of IDLE in light of Bronfenbrenner's ecological systems theory using 103 IDLE-related papers published in A&HCI and SSCI journals between 2010 and 2021. The two most frequently mentioned factors were at the Individual (n = 161; e.g., personal interests and motivation) and Micro-system levels (n = 51; e.g., teachers, family, and friends). Our analysis also found that more research is needed at the Meso-system (n = 9; e.g., social network users and interaction with gamers), Exo-system (n = 11; e.g., parents' income/educational level and mass media), Macro-system (n = 24; e.g., globalization and cultural differences), and Chrono-system levels (n = 7; virtual intercultural experience). The study concludes with promising research agendas, such as school-based action research and the role of parental support, cultural norms, religious beliefs, and pandemic-induced online teaching on one's IDLE perceptions or behaviors.

        "Over the first few months of 2020, the schooling sector shifted to distance education as governments moved to bring the virus, COVID-19, under control. Education sectors rapidly developed online environments. In this milieu teachers have made swift changes to accommodate their students' diverse range of learning needs. In this article, we draw on a qualitative study in Australia to identify key challenges and approaches for fostering school connectedness when students with special educational needs are suddenly required to be educated at distance. A heuristic to define school connectedness is supported that involves connecting with supportive adults; a sense of belonging; positive peer relationships; engagement with learning, and the experience of a positive online climate. Findings from this case study signal that, despite the efforts of educators, students who have special educational needs can slip between the cracks and are at great risk of losing connection both academically and emotionally. There were challenges with students who did not engage in online learning at all. Although practitioners in the study worked with parents to provide the structures for curricula to be addressed, teachers working at distance could enhance school connectedness through fostering teacher and student, and student and student relationships.

        "The majority of Australian students learned remotely in term two (April–June 2020), in response to state government directives to close schools during the 'first wave' of Covid-19. This created myriad challenges for students, teachers and parents. Accordingly, this study seeks to capture these multiple perspectives of the remote learning experience. Forty interviews were conducted at the end of term two, with students, teachers and parents. The findings represent an integrated framework for engagement in the context of remote education. Engaging students was a top priority for teachers – albeit students felt less engaged with teachers. Student–peer engagement varied considerably. Lack of social interaction was a challenge for many students. Parents remained pragmatic, but largely unengaged with teachers. For the most part, students found online learning to be less personalised. While the pandemic has expedited emergency technology adoption in schools, this is not equivalent to the purposeful integration of technology over time. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "Most countries around the world have temporarily closed educational institutions with the aim of containing the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic. How have schools overcome these challenges and delivered education during the confinement period? The purpose of this research was to analyse how primary and secondary schools in Catalonia (Spain) implemented the teaching and learning process during the lockdown, based on 48 semi-structured interviews with school principals from different types of schools, located in urban and rural environments, and from diverse socioeconomic statuses. This article shows that there is a digital divide in students and teachers, emotional accompaniment as a need for online learning, older students are more autonomous and self-regulate better their own learning process, each school used their own strategy because there was no programme prepared for emergency situations, teachers had difficulties in self-regulating their work and communication with families became essential.

        "Digital literacy is a need for our current society. In Mexico, digital incursion programs are barely implemented, which represents an educational delay compared to other countries that have faced the need to integrate the teaching of digital skills, in a wide range of educational levels. This paper presents a learning environment of Computational Thinking called EasyLogic3D, which proposes a novel integration of emotional recognition, gamification, and a 3D environment. Experiments with 102 children from an Elementary School in Mexico were carried out, where cognitive and technological acceptance tests were performed. Analyzing the Cronbach's alpha score, we found that students accepted the technology (learning environment). Also, the results showed that the perceived enjoyment when using the learning environment was positive. On the other hand, results show that the learning gained through using the learning environment was comparable to a class session in which the same topics and exercises were presented.

        "This study examined the perceptions and experiences of a teacher and students in a Shanghai public primary school when digital games were used in a second‐grade math class. The participants included one teacher and 45 students. Data collection methods included classroom observation, focus‐group and individual interviews, and document analysis. Digital gameplay, when used once daily over a 6‐day period, was found to enhance student engagement and interest in learning; many students, however, were concerned about its effect on academic achievement and eyesight. The teacher employed a \"making thinking visible\" approach using pencil and paper and problem‐solving strategies to help students understand the game's mathematical principles and master mathematical knowledge. Obstacles included large class size, difficulty evaluating learning outcomes, balancing fun and learning, and effective game–classroom integration. This study found that exam‐oriented education and traditional teacher‐centred teaching in China influenced participants' perceptions and experiences of digital game‐based learning. Lay Description: What is already known about this topic: Digital game‐based learning is effective and leads to a more relaxed learning environment that promotes students' engagement, interest, motivation, and confidence.Learning with digital games helps students acquire mathematics knowledge more effectively than traditional classroom lectures.Digital game‐based learning is helpful in math class as it makes students feel challenged and more capable, thereby improving self‐efficacy and task persistence. What this paper adds: Mathematics teachers and students have a contradictory attitude that shows both approval and concern towards game‐based learning.In the Chinese context, exam‐oriented culture is an important factor that influences the teacher's and students' perceptions and experiences of digital game‐based learning.While digital game‐based learning helps students' engagement and interest in math, it also faces numerous challenges such as large class size, balancing fun and learning, and effective game–classroom integration. Implications for practice and/or policy: Digital game‐based learning may be more effective when combined with pencil and paper to write down the process and make thinking visible.Fun and learning should be balanced in digital game‐based learning.Teachers need training and support for digital game‐centred programmes to succeed.

        "The development of Information and Communication Technology has created waves of excitement about its power to fix educational problems and improve learning results, prompting a succession of policy efforts to integrate digital technology into education. Educators, schools and corporations are increasingly driving these initiatives. This article makes the argument that a narrow vision of digital technology, which both ignores the complexity of education and wastes valuable public resources, is becoming an obstacle to significant improvement and transformation in education. Utilising our research and experience in the field of educational technology, this paper problematises the common elision of 'technology' and 'digital technology'. From this basis, we then critically reflect on various common approaches to introducing digital technology in education under the guise of promoting equality and digital inclusion. These include national government-led programmes, more recent trends for local school-led initiatives, and the role of non-formal education initiatives led by corporations/foundations. Amidst the varying surface-level 'failure' and/or 'success' of these approaches, we point to limited underpinning 'information and knowledge society' logics in framing the application of digital technology to education. As such we conclude by considering the educational challenges for future Ed-Tech initiatives. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "This study sought to explore distance education students' readiness to use digital learning materials from a College of Distance Education programme which was in the process of transforming the face to face approach of delivery to a more digitized one in Ghana. Using a descriptive survey design, 400 distance learning students were randomly sampled to respond to a 14-item questionnaire. However, 306 students duly responded and completed the questionnaire on their readiness to use digital tools, their access to digital technologies and the internet as well as challenges they envisage to confront in using digitized learning materials. The results revealed that majority of the students affirmed their readiness to use digital learning materials for learning. While respondents of the study did not report high access levels of some digital technologies such as tablets/iPad, desktop computers and laptops, majority of the students had personal access to smartphones with internet capabilities. Thus, the study highlights the potential of mobile phone device usage in distance learning and contends that in the midst of challenges bothering on access levels and high cost of internet, distance education institutions can operate the policy on bring-your-own-device (BYOD) in which distance learners make use of their personally owned devices to access digital content to support their learning.

        "Nowadays robotics is one of promising avenues in the sphere of emerging technologies. In the teaching/learning environment we deal with educational robotics, which is a mixture of theory and practice, knowledge of computer technology, Mathematics and Physics. The two vectors are combined in educational robotics: the educational vector and the technological vector. As an academic discipline and an area of practical application, Robotics means a very broad spectrum of modern knowledge of diverse academic engineering specialties (fields of expertise). That means that Robotics is interdisciplinary in nature. The work provides an overview of the research aimed at studying Robot – Man interaction. Besides, the work considers some promising international cooperation between children from around the world on the development of robotics, and the experience and benefits gained from such cooperation. As an example of the international cooperation in the sphere of Robotics, the two countries, Russia and Kazakhstan, are considered. The article gives an example of the international cooperation of some educational centers, describes the experience of the work on robotics with children of various ages, and the cooperation of various schools working in this field in Kazakhstan and Russia. The working experience in the sphere of social robotics aimed at helping people has become a priority for the children from the interdisciplinary teams from Russia and Kazakhstan. Interaction and cooperation in the sphere of robotics was also used for introducing unconventional curricula, which included courses on robotic technologies as tools for considering social aspects of robotics and artificial intelligence.

        "There is now an emerging worldwide trend for mobile phones being banned from classrooms and schools. While some academics working in the area of educational technology have raised concerns, many others have so far failed to respond to what is a significant shift in the ongoing development of digital education. The paper considers how academic researchers and other educational technology stakeholders can respond to what might be perceived as the curtailment of some forms of digital education. In particular, the paper argues that this current turn away from digital devices offers an opportunity to advance understandings about a number of seemingly problematic issues regarding the continued use of digital technologies in schools. In particular, the paper reconsiders five such areas of concern that are associated with banning phones from school: (1) technology addition; (2) digital distraction; (3) cyberbullying; (4) surveillance capitalism; and (5) environmental sustainability of digital education.

        "The introduction of artificial intelligence in education (AIED) is likely to have a profound impact on the lives of children and young people. This article explores the different types of artificial intelligence (AI) systems in common use in education, their social context and their relationship with the growth of commercial knowledge monopolies. This in turn is used to highlight data privacy rights issues for children and young people, as defined by the 2018 General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR). The article concludes that achieving a balance between fairness, individual pedagogic rights (Bernstein, 2000), data privacy rights and effective use of data is a difficult challenge, and one not easily supported by current regulation. The article proposes an alternative, more democratically aware basis for artificial intelligence use in schools. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "This article examines young people's sense of self and collective identity in relation to their use of specific digital tools available at their school. We use membership categorisation analysis (MCA) to explore how a group of young people produce a collective identity‐in‐interaction as captured in concrete relational speech acts. Fine‐grained MCA analysis of group interview talk reveals participant students operating as a collectivity to accomplish a sense of shared identity in relation to the iPad. This focus on the ways in which young people's identities are intertwined with digital technology distinguishes this article from the technicist and operational perspectives that dominate the field of educational technology research and demonstrates MCA's potential for illuminating the relationship that young people have with technology. The article contributes to a growing body of research that engages with more nuanced ways of understanding contemporary, technology‐mediated learning as a process of producing not only knowledge and skills, but also selfhood—both private and shared.

        "Post-critical pedagogy, which offers a significant alternative to the dominant trends in contemporary philosophy of education, objects to seeing education as instrumental to other ends: it attempts to conceive of education as autotelic, namely as having intrinsic value. While there are good reasons for accepting the post-critical reservations with the instrumentalization of education, I argue that its autonomy is equally problematic, as it risks turning the philosophy of education—perhaps education itself—into a privileged activity, out of touch with the most important issues in the contemporary world. In this paper I offer post-critical pedagogy a way out of this dilemma, by drawing on Walter Benjamin's essay \"The Work of Art in the Age of Its Technological Reproducibility\". After presenting the thesis concerning the autonomy of art held by Benjamin's Frankfurt School friends, and pointing to the similarity between their view and that of post-critical pedagogy, I articulate six Benjaminian theses on post-critical pedagogy. Following Benjamin's claim that the technological reproducibility of art changes the way it is perceived as well as its political function, I argue that school is an educational technology that reproduces the world to the masses without an \"aura\", in a way that allows for political critique that does not reduce education to politics. Next, I highlight the importance of the school to post-critical pedagogy, and contribute to developing the critical-political aspect that remains essential to post-critical pedagogy. Finally, the Benjaminian perspective also makes it possible to reflect on the relation of digital technologies of reproduction to post-critical pedagogy. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "Demand for the use of mobile apps in mental health interventions has grown in recent years, particularly among adolescents who experience elevated levels of distress. However, there is a scarcity of evidence for the effectiveness of these tools within this population. The aim of this study was to test the effectiveness of CopeSmart, a mental health mobile app, using a multicentre cluster randomised controlled trial design. Participants were 15–18-years-olds (N = 560) recruited from 10 schools randomly assigned to an intervention or control condition. Intervention participants used the app over a 4-week period. Multi-level modelling analyses revealed no significant changes in the intervention group from pre-test to post-test, when compared to the control group, in terms of emotional distress, well-being, emotional self-awareness or coping strategies. Findings suggest that a 4-week app-based intervention may not be enough to elicit intra-personal changes in mental health outcomes in a general adolescent population. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "A multiple case study was conducted to investigate how Lego robotics instruction incorporated into a middle grades mathematics methods course could inform pre-service teachers’ (PSTs) TPACK through the lens of Social Constructivist Theory. The qualitative data analysis revealed that when instruction on Lego robotics technology is integrated into semester long mathematics methods courses, PSTs are able to improve their TPACK knowledge in regard to the robotics. Overall, the findings suggest instruction of educational technology tools should be incorporated into methods courses over a longer duration of time, and in depth, to better support the development of PSTs’ TPACK. To meet the demands of the teacher shortages while simultaneously supporting the needs of school districts, this research provides preliminary evidence of the need to incorporate content-specific technology into all methods courses.

        "With the advent of mobile technologies, well‐designed fraction apps can be used to help children gain fraction knowledge, a challenging topic for both teachers and students. The present pilot study adopted a quasi‐experimental design to investigate whether children can learn fraction concepts equally well if half of the lesson time (20 min) is replaced with game‐based learning. Keeping the total lesson time (40 min) identical, the control group (N = 33) received traditional instruction, and the experimental group (N = 32) was presented with a blended learning approach spending half of the class time (20 min) playing tablet‐based fraction games, where each of the learners had their own tablet. The results suggested that in the posttest, the experimental group achieved similar learning gains to the control group and appear to have achieved better performance in the transfer test than the control group. This paper also discusses the efficiency of game‐based learning, the mechanism of how fraction games might enhance learning, and the potential of integrating game‐based learning in educational settings. Lay Description: What is already known about this topicAs a significant mathematical concept in daily life, fractions are crucial for later success in math learning.As a promising new technology, educational games show a great potential for improving learning.Well‐designed fraction apps can be used to help children gain fraction knowledge.What this paper addsGame‐based fraction learning can be combined with formal learning in school education.Game‐based fraction learning might provide a more efficient approach to increasing students' conceptual knowledge of fractions.The result showed that the experimental group achieved a similar cognitive level as the control group although they spent half of the time playing a game, suggesting that children can gain knowledge from the experiences of playing games.What are the implications for practice and/or policyThe result suggests that the proper use of educational games in teaching fractions can make learning more efficient.Further research needs to be done to determine whether the fraction understanding gained through playing these games will have an impact on students' future learning of more complicated fraction concepts.

        "\"Que voyager c'est apprendre à vivre\". This is how Montaigne starts one his essays, \"traveling is learning to live\". It was certainly my story. And this story begins in the 1970s. I went to the U.S. for graduate education, my interests have always been the psychology of learning and its practical implications for education. During my doctoral studies, I had the opportunity to engage in international projects led by my thesis advisor, Robert Morgan. At the time he was one of the principal advisors of the educational reform in Korea. In the early seventies there was great optimism about the potential of \"new technologies,\" including emerging ones like Educational Radio, Educational TV, and Computer-based education. Ronald Gass was leading CERI – a Center for Educational Innovation at the OCDE, sponsored a tour which provided me with a taste of educational developments in Europe and also gave me to opportunity to evaluate a distance-learning program in Portugal. This is how I entered the world of international education. Returning to Brazil after completing my doctorate in the USA – I think I was the first Brazilian to obtain a doctoral degree in Education - I actively participated in various initiatives in Brazil between 1973 and 1986, including the Ministry of Education, in the area of distance education, in the Ministry of Planning, in the areas of Science and Technology and in a special non-portfolio Ministry in charge of \"De-bureaucratization\". These experiences in my own country provided me with valuable insights into the possibilities and limitations of change, innovation, technology, and reforms in general. Three significant experiences shaped my understanding of change processes and their impact. First and more important, I learned that implementing educational technology projects was an attractive proposition, innovations are always welcome, but scaling up and interfering with regular school operations remained a chimera. Second, I witnessed the launching and implementation of policies and institutions in the fields of science and technology, the major push came from the Ministry of Planning. This effort taught me the importance of a strong start, selecting competent leaders and individuals with appropriate credentials. I also learned to recognize the significance of institution-building as a foundation for sustainable change. A third, and pivotal experience, was related to large-scale administrative reform. A special ministry was created to simplify rules and regulations in a highly bureaucratic and formalistic culture. I learned how power, bureaucracy and corruption were deeply interwined. I also learned that while initiating change may be relatively straightforward, the resilience of bureaucracies often undermines the best intentions. Bringing about and sustaining change requires addressing both structural and attitudinal transformations. Leadership, continuity, and accountability are essential. Chance can also play a role. These experiences led me to delve into the study of organizations and organizational change. A post-doc at Stanford Business School gave me the opportunity to study, learn, and exchange ideas with various experts on the sociology of organizations, such as Jim March (bounded rationality), Richard Scott (formal organizations), Judith Tendler (Inside Foreign Aid), Aaron Wildawsky (Implementation), and John Meyer (Formal Structure as Myth and Ceremony), among many others. Despite the warnings, knowledge, and experience, hope prevailed. Despite being based in Brazil, throughout this period, I was engaged in numerous consultancy activities over the years, collaborating with organizations such as the Organization of American States (OAS), UNESCO, OECD, and USAID in various countries. I learned a great deal from Dean Jamison and François Orivel about economics and cost/effectiveness studies, and also learned how evidence played such a minor role in actual decision-making. I also learned a great deal about implementation of large-scale projects in several consulting missions with Emile McAnany and John Mayo. Throughout these experiences, I learned far more than I contributed. Just before joining the World Bank in 1986, I sought to understand how Brazil interacted with the institution. In a conversation with the Brazilian Minister of Planning at the time, I obtained an extremely valuable piece of information: Brazil was primarily interested in obtaining \"hard currency\" rather than specific projects. This revelation made me realize that the logic and intentions of the local government differed significantly from those of financiers or even sectoral ministries. This early insight made me aware of the limitations of project-based change. With this background, I could not be accused of naivety. And so, my international journey continued. • The paper reflects on two major issues. First, on the differences the author experienced in the late eighties and nineties in his relationships with the World Bank, ILO and OCDE. The second part focus on the activities undertaken by the author on his return to Brazil and how these activities benefited from his international experience. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "The power of reflection is highly acknowledged to promote learning and develop expertise, yet reflective skills are rarely explicitly taught in schools. As a result, encouraging reflection among learners is often difficult to accomplish, especially in the Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) setting. By employing the Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) construct, this research investigated the use of structured reflection through digital learning portfolios (e-portfolio) and explores its relation to students' learning. Using mixed methods design, this study examined a group of students from one of the TVET institutions in Brunei over an eight-week period as they practiced reflection through e-portfolio designed to guide the students to reflect upon their own learning. The students' e-portfolio notes were converted to Students' Reflective Scores (SRS) as a measure of level of reflection. The data gathered revealed that although student performance can have a moderate effect on students' level of reflection, building structured opportunities to reflect and integrate learning can develop students' ability to reflect better. The quality of students' reflection had significantly increased throughout the study period as more students exhibited higher-order thinking in their e-portfolio. Meanwhile, the key themes emerging from the semi-structured interview data revealed that while students see reflection in detached ways, the intervention had provided the opportunity for students to enhance both their cognitive and metacognitive skills. The students' responses also implied that operational feasibility of e-portfolio for Brunei TVET might depend on teachers' input, students' motivation, type of e-portfolio software chosen, and connectivity setting.

        "Virtual reality (VR) and game-based learning strategies have rarely been investigated together with a keen focus on motivational processing. This lack of understanding on motivational support of VR game-based learning has hindered the design of such environments to effectively and efficiently support intended learning processes. The study revealed relationships between learners' motivational processing and perceived game features in a VR learning environment for delivering introductory archaeology content to college students. The first part of the study adopted the complementary concurrent mixed-method design, which applied qualitative results to clarify quantitative findings to delineate motivational support perceived by 40 participants. The second part employed quantitative survey data only from the same sample to reveal perceived game features and relationships between motivational support and game features. Findings suggest that learners' motivational processing was supported by the Confidence and Satisfaction components of the ARCS motivational design model. Additionally, not all motivational components were supported by perceived game features according to multiple regression analyses. The discussion of the findings is focused on in what areas and to what extent multimedia-rich VR elements might compete with game-based learning in the same learning environment for learners' limited cognitive and behavioral learning capacities.

        "A challenge with flipped instruction is the pre-class preparation, where students independently learn fundamental content outside the classroom. For this pre-class learning, instructors typically assign videos with quizzes. However, this approach is the same for all and does not address differential needs. In a prior National Science Foundation (NSF) study with three schools, differences in the outcomes for blended versus flipped instruction in a numerical method course were not statistically significant, and the effect sizes were small. To diversify pre-class preparation and potentially improve outcomes in the flipped classroom, the instructor developed lessons using an adaptive platform via a new NSF grant. The adaptive platform provides personalized, flexible learning with multiple resources, including videos, text, quizzes, and simulations, with different paths depending on a student's progress. Adaptive lessons were implemented during two semesters in a flipped classroom, and the results were compared to (1) flipped instruction without adaptive lessons and (2) blended instruction. The comparisons consisted of direct assessments (i.e. exams) and student evaluations via survey. Analysis was done collectively for students and for several demographic groups. Based on direct and indirect measures, the flipped classroom with adaptive learning may be the preferred method for this and other STEM courses. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "This qualitative study examines the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics in learning designs from the perspective of learning sciences. The literature on the topic indicates that there is not enough research on including diverse learning outcomes in the designs for learning. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to understand how AI and robots impact physical, social‐emotional and intellectual learning outcomes through the implementation of learning designs that are guided by selected design principles. In this study, the design‐based research (DBR) methodology was employed for investigating learning in naturalistic contexts. The intervention was implemented in a primary school in which learners used educational robots. The main findings reveal that the development of an integrated analytical framework, which considers a broader spectrum of human potential, allows for analyzing students' learning outcomes in a more integral, inclusive and balanced way. This, in turn, promotes students' learning by using AI and robots. Another finding reveals that the impact of using AI and robotics on learning designs is reflected in learners' personal trajectories having different pathways and paces. Finally, the lessons learned and the challenges to be overcome are summarized, and recommendations are made for future research for the enhancement of learning experiences that use AI and robotics.

        "During the COVID-19 pandemic, many grandparents in China have spent more time with their grandchildren than they used to. When their adult children returned to work after a period of lockdown, many grandparents extended their roles from taking care of household tasks and looking after their grandchildren's basic needs to supervising their online learning and providing academic support. It has been a precious opportunity for both the children and their grandparents to get to know each other better and to learn from each other. During this challenging period of home learning, a Chinese initiative called the \"Shaping Students' Vacation Life Project\" (SSVLP), which is led by the Shanghai Municipal Institute for Lifelong Education (SMILE) of East China Normal University (ECNU), conducted a two-month project that investigated intergenerational learning between grandparents and grandchildren (IL-GP&GC) across seven primary schools located in six areas of China. They explored topics such as pandemic prevention, health and fitness, traditional culture and information literacy. Following this, the co-authors of this article conducted an interpretive inquiry to explore how the participating primary schools implemented the IL-GP&GC project, and to understand its impact. Based on in-depth interviews with 11 teachers and 7 families (including 7 grandchildren aged 7–13, and their 7 grandparents aged 60–68), four main findings emerged: (1) both generations gained more health knowledge, life skills and values; (2) the older generation changed their learning perspective and behaviours; (3) the younger generation understood their grandparents more and cultivated the concept of lifelong learning; and (4) the relationships between grandparents and grandchildren became closer.

        "Résumé: Mise en œuvre et efficacité de l'apprentissage intergénérationnel pendant la pandémie de COVID-19 : résultats d'une enquête menée en Chine – En Chine, pendant la pandémie de COVID-19, beaucoup de grands-parents ont passé plus de temps que d'ordinaire avec leurs petits-enfants. Quand leurs enfants ont repris le travail en présentiel après le confinement, en plus d'assumer les tâches ménagères et de prendre soin des besoins fondamentaux de leurs petits-enfants, nombre d'entre eux ont étendu leur rôle à la surveillance de l'apprentissage en ligne et au soutien scolaire. Tant pour eux que pour leurs petits-enfants, ça a été l'occasion de mieux se connaître et la source d'un apprentissage réciproque. Pendant cette période difficile de l'école à la maison, un projet chinois appelé Projet d'organisation de la vie des élèves pendant les vacances (Shaping Students' Vacation Life Project/SSVLP), dirigé par l'Institut municipal de Shanghai d'éducation tout au long de la vie (Shanghai Municipal Institute for Lifelong Education/SMILE) de l'école normale supérieure de Chine orientale (East China Normal University/ECNU), a étudié deux mois durant l'apprentissage intergénérationnel entre grands-parents et petits-enfants (grandparents and grandchildren/IL-GP&GC) dans sept écoles primaires de six régions de Chine. Il s'est penché sur des sujets comme la prévention de la pandémie, la santé et la condition physique, la culture traditionnelle et la maîtrise de l'information. À la suite de cela, les auteurs de cet article ont mené une enquête d'interprétation pour examiner comment les écoles primaires participantes avaient mis en œuvre le projet d'apprentissage intergénérationnel entre grands-parents et petits-enfants et en comprendre l'impact. Cette enquête qui s'appuyait sur des interviews approfondies menées avec onze enseignants et sept familles (dont sept petits-enfants âgés de 7 à 13 ans et sept grands-parents âgés de 60 à 68 ans), a permis de dégager quatre constats principaux : (1) pour les deux générations, une amélioration des connaissances en matière de santé, des compétences nécessaires dans la vie courante et des valeurs a été constatée; (2) les anciens ont modifié leurs points de vue et comportements en matière d'apprentissage; (3) les jeunes ont appris à mieux comprendre leurs grands-parents et à cultiver le concept d'apprentissage tout au long de la vie, et (4) les liens entre les grands-parents et leurs petits-enfants se sont resserrés.

        "While learning can happen anywhere and everywhere, most educational practices in K-12 are confined within the walls of a classroom and the school; such practices narrowly define learning and exclude the opportunities that an expanded and digitally mediated definition of learning can offer. Augmented reality (AR) technologies offer exciting new opportunities for supporting ubiquitous learning, by superimposing layers of digital information on the real world. The digital augmentation can provide enriched learning experiences, through situating the learning content in authentic contexts and fostering inquiry-based learning. Nonetheless, learning can often be sidestepped as the use of AR technologies becomes a mere fun activity, akin to a treasure hunt. Such challenges indicate the need to provide scaffolded AR environments to support deep learning. These ideas are reflected in the design of the TraceReaders, a platform for enabling location-based mobile learning using augmented reality (AR) technologies. TraceReaders supports the authoring of inquiry-based AR apps, to engage students in evidence-driven reflective inquiry in situ. This paper first describes the theoretical commitments which guided the development of the TraceReaders platform, followed by a description of its design rationale. Two case studies of informal inquiry learning using TraceReaders are then presented: the first one reports on the use of the \"Young Archaeologists\" TraceReaders app to support primary school students' historical reasoning, while the second one reports on the \"Mystery at the Lake\" app to support high school students' environmental science inquiry. These cases offer the opportunity to discuss the affordances and challenges in using such a scaffolded tool to support location-based AR learning in situ. The discussion concludes with lessons learned from empirical studies about the design and effectiveness of tools like the TraceReaders platform and future steps. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "The goal of higher vocational education is professional training of students. Teaching contents related to practical training are the most important for preparing students for work in real-life conditions. The mobile learning model presented in this paper analyzes the possibility of implementing augmented reality in the process of educating vocational engineers in the domain of postal networks. The technology of augmented reality was introduced with the goal of making access to learning materials easier, as well as improving the interaction between materials and students. The paper compares the results of traditional learning and learning using augmented reality in the part of the curriculum important for vocational skills. The described model was implemented in the course titled Postal Services Practicum in the final year of vocational studies at the ICT College of Vocational Studies in Belgrade. The participants in the model were students studying a curriculum in the domain of realizing postal services. The goal of implementing the model is to show that augmented reality shortens the time of realizing a task, as opposed to realizing it using printed materials, as well as the fact that the efficiency of solving a task is higher as opposed to the traditional method.

        "Ubiquitous computing (ubicomp) and the Internet of things (IoT) are turning into everyday household technology at an ever‐increasing pace, for example, in the form of connected toys. However, while ubicomp and IoT are changing and shaping children's digital and technological landscape, not much is known about how children perceive these omnipresent and concealed forms of digital technology. This qualitatively oriented paper explores 3‐ to 6‐year‐old Finnish children's perceptions of ubicomp and IoT via interviews and a design task. Initially, the children were skeptical toward the idea that tangible objects, such as toys, could be computer and/or Internet enabled. However, these perceptions were subject to change when children were introduced to a scientific conception of what computers and the Internet are and asked to apply their knowledge to a technological design task. Implications for early years digital literacy education are discussed in the paper. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "As the COVID-19 crisis continues to develop, communities around the world find themselves living in new and uncertain times. School and university closures are significantly disrupting the lives of students, educators and researchers alike. With the sudden shift to online learning platforms, the limitations on research projects and the lack of standardised policies and procedures, many concerns arise surrounding the unequal impacts of this crisis. This article brings together diverse perspectives on the effects of COVID-19 on post-secondary life for students and scholars engaged in the field of Indigenous health research. The authors reflect on how this time has impacted them as a graduating student, incoming PhD student, junior faculty member and mid-career faculty member respectively. Their experiences of teaching and learning at a large, research-intensive university in Toronto, Canada have been profoundly transformed, and will continue to change the way they work, research and interact at the graduate level. Working with Indigenous communities and organisations requires relationship building, collaboration and ceremony. In these unprecedented times, scholars cannot simply continue \"business as usual\". They must adapt everything, including how they teach, learn and work with Indigenous peoples, who are particularly vulnerable to this pandemic. Reflecting on the impacts that have already occurred and those that are still likely to come, the authors discuss what changes may need to be made in academia to support diverse actors within their scholarly community. They suggest changes to their scholarship with Indigenous communities in Canada to help them continue to work in a respectful, reciprocal and culturally appropriate way.

        "Résumé: L'éducation dans des temps incertains : la vie universitaire pour les chercheurs dans le domaine de la santé des autochtones à l'heure de la COVID-19 – La crise de la COVID-19, qui continue de prendre de l'ampleur, plonge des communautés du monde entier dans des périodes inédites et incertaines. Les fermetures d'écoles et d'universités perturbent considérablement la vie des étudiants au même titre que celle des éducateurs et des chercheurs. Le brusque passage aux plateformes d'apprentissage en ligne, les restrictions imposées aux projets de recherche et l'absence de politiques et de procédés standardisés ont fait apparaître des préoccupations concernant l'impact hétérogène de la crise en cours. Cet article réunit différents points de vue sur les effets qu'a la COVID-19 sur la vie des étudiants de troisième cycle et des chercheurs dans le domaine de la recherche sur la santé des autochtones. Les auteures se penchent sur la façon dont cette période a impacté leur existence respectivement en tant qu'étudiante en fin de deuxième cycle, future doctorante et membres du corps professoral en début et en milieu de carrière ; une période qui a profondément marqué leur expérience de l'enseignement et de l'apprentissage dans une université centrée sur la recherche dans la ville canadienne de Toronto, et qui continuera à transformer leur façon de travailler, de faire de la recherche et d'interagir au niveau de l'enseignement supérieur. Travailler avec des communautés et organisations autochtones exige de construire des relations et de collaborer avec elles, et de respecter leurs usages. En cette période sans précédent, les universitaires ne peuvent pas faire comme si de rien n'était. Ils doivent tout adapter, y compris leur façon d'enseigner, d'apprendre et de travailler avec les peuples autochtones, particulièrement vulnérables face à cette pandémie. Dans une réflexion sur les conséquences qui se sont déjà fait sentir et sur celles probablement à venir, les auteures se penchent sur les changements susceptibles de devenir indispensables dans la sphère universitaire pour soutenir différents acteurs de leur communauté scientifique. Elles proposent des changements à leur travail avec les communautés autochtones au Canada pour les aider à continuer à opérer dans le respect et la réciprocité, et de façon adaptée sur le plan culturel.

        "The application of gamification to the teaching-learning process across different fields of knowledge constitutes an emerging practice applied across all levels of education, from primary school up to university. This article, in keeping with the importance of the applications of this type of tool, holds the general objective of undertaking the mapping of research articles that approach the application of gamification techniques to teaching-learning processes in general education of all areas and the teaching of management in particular. In order to achieve this, this article describes the organisational structure of the field research in terms of publications, authors and journals as well as identifying and classifying the research articles about adopting gamification methods. Hence, the subject of analysis encapsulates scientific articles published in either the ISI Web of Science (WOS) or Scopus (SCO) databases related to the application of gamification to the teaching process in general and to management in particular. The present research focused on the mapping of the literature related to the application of gamification to the management field because we didn't find an article in the literature addressing this particular area. The existence of this GAP motivated the authors to conduct a research directed to the analysis of scientific studies in which gamification had been applied in this area. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "In this work, we theorise the role of the educational technologist in an educational institution as a \"variety-handler\". That is, we theorise the educational technologist as responsible for the orchestration of educational and technical resources, namely tools, either to attenuate systemic variety or amplify regulative variety at a certain level of recursion. To do so, we carried out a single case study that focused on the work of the educational technologist in a Music College. The educational technologist provided support to an accordion teacher and his student in remote music lessons. We collected qualitative data from the practice of the educational technologist and the experience of both the teacher and the student over six months (mainly observations and interviews) and we analyzed them building on research from managerial cybernetics, in particular, Stafford Beer's Viable System Model (VSM). Our case study indicates that, depending on the context, the educational technologist may overtake many roles, such as be a designer, technician, researcher, planner and so on. But the central role is that of handling variety in order to avoid disruption that could potentially affect the lesson negatively. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "This survey-based study explores the nature of Digital Divide among Ghana's basic (primary and junior high) schools from the perspective of Teachers' Digital Literacy and their usage of digital technologies in school. The ICT-enhanced Teacher Standards for Africa (ICTeTSA) Framework comprising digital attitude, knowledge, skills and application components was used for measuring the perceived Teacher Digital Literacy, while, the European Union's rubrics for measuring ICT frequency in schools was adopted for estimating the extent of teachers' digital technology usage/activities. The study covered six districts in Ghana with 233 teachers (n = 233) sampled from 45 schools. Based perceptions of the Teacher Digital Literacy two significantly different Digital Divide clusters were found among schools that diverged based on the teachers' digital application component of Teacher Digital Literacy. While, most schools teachers claimed an above average level of Teacher Digital Literacy; however, more than 50% of the schools are digitally proactive. Suggesting that teachers appear not to be actually using ICT tools and digital resources for professional practice. The cluster of schools differentiated by the extent of digital activities (TDA) were performed weekly. The study reveals several critical issues of teachers' digital empowerment for technology in Ghana's basic schools, of which school-based management (SBM) governance be adapted to address them.

        "There is an emerging concern that modern technology‐saturated environments, particularly computer games, are inhibiting the development of children's empathic behaviour and social skills. We argue that the solution is embedded in the problem when hybrid learning design blends real‐life social interpersonal interactions with digital representations. We present theory‐informed design principles for creating tablet games with a focus on promoting empathic perception—a building block for the ability to see, sense and understand other's internal states. Based on these principles, the game Empathy World was developed and trialled in a naturalistic three‐month study in an early childhood education setting. Children learned to perceive empathy‐worthy cues in various scenes and interacted with the tablet game to further their perspective‐taking and to associate emotions with social contexts. The findings from this study show an increase in the selective tendency of children's in‐game perception of empathy‐worthy stimuli and enhanced empathic concern. We argue that future design for learning can utilise the strengths of hybrid design for social development at a larger scale: integrating theoretically informed and rigorously tested digital tools in existing educational and social environments. Practitioner NotesWhat is already known about this topic Research has examined various developmental benefits of empathy and shown that empathy can be learnt.Digital games can be productive, easy to scale, tools that support learning.Sound design, based on theory‐informed principles, can improve the effectiveness of digital learning games.What this paper adds It synthesises theories and research evidence of empathy and its development.It shows how empathy‐related theoretical ideas and evidence were translated into hybrid design principles for developing empathy games and embedding them into children's social learning environment.It illustrates how theory‐ and evidence‐informed design principles were used to create a digital game to enhance empathic learning of young children in a hybrid technology‐mediated environment.It explores and validates the effectiveness of a hybrid design approach by implementing the digital empathy game in children's natural learning environment and analysing the data by capturing emerging patterns of development stemming from gameplay.Implications for practice and/or policy Pre‐schools could enhance children's empathy learning by integrating specially designed empathy games in existing learning environments.Teachers and parents should be informed about how to create game‐mediated hybrid environments that enhance children's empathy.

        "The present study aims to investigate the trends of mobile learning in physical education by reviewing the journal publications from the Scopus database. Several dimensions, including application domains, adopted mobile devices, research methods, research subjects, adopted teaching strategies, research issues, and learning locations are taken into account. The results show that the number of mobile learning papers in physical education has increased year after year, and that the integration of new mobile technologies into physical education activities is becoming much more common. The adoption of mobile devices in physical education and professional training, especially for the development of smartphones and wearable devices, facilitates the abundance of physical education and the growth of social physical education; however, the overall usage of such high-tech devices as wearable technologies is still limited. Most attention has been paid to communities on university campuses, but more focus should be placed on junior and senior high school and elementary school students. Currently, the types of sports involved in mobile learning are comparatively few; most focus on dynamic physical education. The application of mainstream teaching strategies of mobile learning in physical education is also limited. Accordingly, several research issues for mobile technologies in physical education are recommended. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "Traditional lecture theatre environments present significant challenges in higher education, in light of increasingly large and diverse student populations. This small-scale study explores how blended learning through the game-based platform Kahoot! can be used to enhance the learning experience offered to students in these spaces, from the perspective of 44 final-year primary education undergraduates. An action research approach was employed with data collected from pre- and post-lecture surveys. Findings suggest that the integration of synchronous online learning in lecture theatres presented no technical difficulties and that gaming was successful in enabling active participation and interactive learning. Students valued its competitive nature, the immediacy of feedback on their knowledge and structured opportunities for further discussion. Students reported improvements in engagement, concentration and retention, although results for the latter were more ambiguous and would benefit from further investigation. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "Online learning has grown in popularity, leading to more widespread utilization of online exams. Online exams have started to become a preferred method of assessment in both online and traditional learning environments. They provide various benefits for the learning process and learners when used appropriately within online learning programs. The current study aims to investigate the academic achievement of online learners in online exams as compared to traditional exams and to analyze their perceptions towards online exams. The study was conducted at a state university in Turkey during the 2018 spring semester. Participants of the study are 163 vocational college level online learners. This research has been designed as a mixed method study. In this regard, learners' academic achievement and perceptions have been considered as quantitative data and learners' opinions as qualitative data. Through the use of quantitative analysis methods, it is shown that learners report positive attitudes towards online exams and that there was no statistically significant difference in the students' academic achievement in online and traditional exams. The majority of the learners pointed out that online exams are efficient, usable, and reliable while others indicated a level of insufficiency related to exam duration, as well as concerns about potential technical problems that may occur during the implementation of online exams. Understanding the benefits and challenges of online exams will help the institutions in planning their institutional road map. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "Effective online teaching and learning requires a carefully designed classroom that promotes student engagement with faculty, peers and course content. This research included an investigation of the importance of faculty-student communication and collaboration; student-student communication and collaboration; active learning techniques; prompt feedback; appropriate time for tasks; high performance expectations; and respect for diverse learning styles (preferences) (Chickering and Ehrmann 1996) to faculty in their online teaching and to alumni in their online learning. The participants were 14 college faculty and 111 alumni, from the same graduate program. A 45-item Likert survey and two open-ended questions were presented to the participants to explore the important factors contributing to their online teaching and learning. The results demonstrated that holding students to high standards of performance, academic honesty and professional conduct was the most important factor to both faculty in their online teaching and alumni in their online learning. Additionally, alumni valued engagement with their faculty more than engagement with other students or course content. Students need an online instructor who is organised and communicative in the online classroom, and faculty need a solidly designed online classroom, with engaged students who are timely in their work. An analysis of the findings with specific application to online teaching and learning is presented in this article. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "Geography educators have long taught anthropogenic global climate change (AGCC) using geospatial data, visualizations, analysis tools and models. We examined the attitudes of teachers at secondary schools, research institutions, colleges and universities tasked with teaching using one such technology. We designed a seventeen-question online survey about the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) Educational Global Climate Model (EdGCM) that was completed by 115 respondents. Researchers and educators at more than 150 research and educational institutions internationally have utilized EdGCM since 2005. There are numerous reasons why teaching AGCC with a global climate model (GCM) is attractive, and this study examined the successes and challenges teachers confront when implementing such educational technologies. Those in our sample provided insight into what methods and approaches proved effective in reinforcing conceptual understandings of the geographic processes that shape the Earth system. Our findings show educators are willing to use complex scientific models in their classroom but prefer those that enable genuine student research. We also found that more easily accessible online technologies pose fewer technical challenges and often are preferred by teachers to more complex climate education technologies.

        "Several previous studies have emphasized the importance of situating students in authentic learning or problem‐solving contexts to enhance their learning performances. However, some challenges of situated learning have been stated, such as the lack of effective learning support or concrete objective design to improve students' learning engagement, problem‐solving competences and their active thinking. In this study, a mobile technology‐supported experiential learning system was developed to improve students' problem‐solving competences as well as their learning performances, attitudes and collective efficacy. Moreover, an experiment was conducted on an environmental science course in an elementary school to compare the effects of this method with those of the conventional situated mobile learning approach on students' learning effectiveness. The experimental results display that the implemented approach can significantly enhance students' learning achievements, environmental attitudes and collective efficacy; furthermore, the students who learned with the implemented approach showed higher problem‐solving competence than those who learned with the conventional situated mobile learning approach, implying a noticeable reference for conducting experiential learning activities in environmental science education. Furthermore, the promotion of students' active thinking in the mobile technology‐supported experiential learning is discussed. Practitioner NotesWhat is already known about this topic The importance of situating students in authentic learning or problem‐solving contexts to enhance their learning performances has been emphasized.Some challenges of situated learning have been stated, such as the lack of effective learning support or concrete objective design to improve students' learning engagement, problem‐solving competences and active thinking.Properly integrating technology into instruction is most effective in an authentic learning context.What this paper adds A mobile technology‐supported experiential learning system was designed to conduct an authentic learning activity.The proposed approach can significantly enhance students' learning achievements, environmental attitudes and collective efficacy.The students who learned with the proposed approach showed higher problem‐solving competence than those who learned with the conventional situated mobile learning approach.The promotion of students' active thinking while learning with the mobile technology‐supported experiential learning system is discussed.Implications for practice and/or policy The mobile technology‐supported experiential learning system is beneficial to students in an authentic learning environment as it triggers their active thinking.Such an approach can be designed with authentic learning activities in other courses by replacing the authentic objects and learning materials.It would be interesting to probe students' social interactions and learning patterns in an experiential collective learning activity.

        "Covid-19 and the resultant national lockdown saw thousands of initial teacher education students in South Africa moving at short notice to online learning. For teacher educators this represented significant technical and pedagogical challenges, as they faced the task of adapting their teaching to an online modality, while simultaneously maintaining the academic integrity of their modules. Schools too were closed, creating the possible scenario that new teachers might graduate with little or no practical exposure to the classroom. A previously unheard-of question emerged, namely whether a period of immersion in schools was a non-negotiable in learning to be a teacher. Put otherwise - would it be possible to prepare good teachers while schools were closed for large parts of the year? The article outlines some debates relating to teacher education that emerged in South Africa during this time, linking these to the concepts of situational learning, relational learning and pedagogical reasoning. Questions are then posed as to the potential longer-term implications of this period for teacher education pedagogy in South Africa. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "Attitudes towards sexual health and relationships are learned from a young age, and there is an ongoing need for innovative and comprehensive approaches to sex education that keep pace with rapidly changing contexts of people's lives. We used thematic analysis of data from two qualitative studies in Scotland to explore learning contexts from a multi-generational perspective, as well as the influence of different socio-cultural factors on provision, access to and experience of sex education. The importance, but inadequacy, of school as a source of learning, was a persistent theme over time. Participants' strategies to address perceived gaps in knowledge included experience, conversations, vicarious and online learning. Gender and age differences emerged, with younger participants more likely to go online for information, and prevailing gender norms shaping attitudes and behaviours across both study groups. Participants who identified as gay, lesbian or bisexual described feeling particularly unprepared for sex and relationships due to the narrow, heteronormative content received. Although schools continue to be a common source of information, it appears that they fail to equip young people for their post-school sexual life-course. We recommend the mandatory provision of comprehensive, positive, inclusive and skills-based learning to improve people's chances of forming and building healthy, positive relationships across the lifespan.

        "Background: Students' mastery goals are positively related to adaptive learning behaviour. Moreover, these goals often mediate the relation between perceived classroom characteristics and academic achievement. Research generally shows a decline of academic achievement and mastery goals after transition to middle school. Creating a learning environment at middle school according to students' basic needs for autonomy, competence, and social relatedness might help to reduce these declines. However, little is known about the relationship between perceived fulfilment of needs, mastery goals, and academic achievement. Aims: We investigate the relationship between indicators of students' perceived fulfilment of needs and their graded performance to determine whether the connection is indirect via mastery goals. Sample: We surveyed 2,105 students during the first year in middle school. Methods: We assessed the amount of the students' perceived autonomy, recognition of competence and support from the teacher (as indicators of competence and social relatedness) in class, their mastery goals, and their grades. Multilevel models were calculated. Results: Perceived fulfilment of needs correlated significantly with mastery goals and graded performance. Mastery goals predicted graded performance; however, when perceived fulfilment of needs and mastery goals were analysed simultaneously, the correlation between mastery goals and graded performance was no longer significant. There was no indirect relation between perceived fulfilment of needs and graded performance via mastery goals. Conclusions: Results indicate that creating the learning environment according to the students' basic needs is positively related to their mastery goals and graded performance during the first year at middle school.

        "The effective integration of educational technologies into early childhood education remains a significant challenge. An important element of this challenge is how practitioner beliefs about pedagogy relate to how digital technologies are used in the early years classroom. Focussing on early childhood practitioner beliefs in relation to pedagogy and digital technologies, this paper reports on a doctoral study where Educational Design Research (EDR) methodology was used to investigate how a technology-focussed intervention might lead to changes in one teacher's approach to integrating digital media into her child-centred pedagogy. The data included reflective discussions over a period of 18 months, video observations of digital media use, and scrutiny of relevant documents. The intervention resulted in a change from the teacher being sceptical about the relevance of digital media for early childhood education to her developing effective strategies to integrate digital media into her child-centred pedagogy. This shift in pedagogic approach was made possible by the teacher changing her beliefs about the value of digital technologies in early education. Findings suggest professional learning should address practitioner beliefs about digital media and early years pedagogy, including providing time and space for teacher reflection.

        "Teacher education in Ontario, Canada has had to respond to a myriad of challenges presented by the COVID-19 crisis, particularly after government authorities decided to close schools until students and faculty could return safely. In this paper, we examine some of the major challenges that are being faced by teacher educators as they prepare for September 2020, struggling to re-imagine teaching and learning remotely. We also examine the issues facing teacher education using the lens of 'complex adaptive systems', systems that are unpredictable, have many interacting parts, and are characterised by constant uncertainty both from within and particularly from outside. Some issues affecting teacher education and teacher educators causing this uncertainty in Ontario include 1) access to effective online connection and support, 2) educator professional development for online learning, 3) conversion of face-to-face courses to successful online courses, and 4) the recognition of student teachers' practica experiences. Although this article provides a snapshot of the Ontario context and the challenges it currently faces in teacher education, it also presents some solutions, and by thinking of the context as an example of a complex adaptive system, it also holds out hope for the future.

        "As Covid-19 cases increased rapidly in Malaysia, the Movement Control Order was imposed nationwide by the government, resulting in immediate closure of schools and universities. Consequently, teaching and learning were instantaneously transformed into distance and remote formats. This article offers a snapshot into how teacher educators and student teachers, coped with the unprecedented situation. We also share our reflections and examination of the online teaching and learning experiences through the lens of TPACK and online learning models. A major implication for both teacher educators and student teachers is to acquire TPACK – technological knowledge and technological pedagogical knowledge to ensure learning continuity and equity.

        "There are many digital technologies available to support teaching and learning. Historically the focus has tended to be on computers, but this has extended to include interactive whiteboards and tablets. As well as these technologies, which were originally designed for adults, there are devices specifically designed to support teaching and learning in the early years. These tend to be overlooked in the literature. This project aimed to find out if this reflected practice in early years settings. Participants from 20 early years settings in the North East of England were asked about 'educational technologies'. This term was deliberately not defined, the aim was to find out what they thought it meant. They were asked about the technology they had, and how it was being used. This provided an opportunity to explore whether their use of technology fit with their beliefs about teaching and learning. Findings suggest that technology is seen as more than computers and that technology is being used to support a broad range of activities in line with practitioners' pedagogical beliefs.

        "All over the globe, educational technology (EdTech) is being sold to schools as a central mechanism for improving access to quality learning for high poverty populations. There is a growing scholarship that interrogates the institutional drivers of the ‘EdTech craze’. Building on this work, this paper examines how technocentrism as a specific strain of neoliberalism is reflected at both the organizational and institutional levels, both by private and public sectors in the case of school education in India. We argue that using institutional theory to explain complex multi-layered reforms means looking in tandem at macro principles defined through interactions in the organizational field and the re-experiencing and transformation of those processes at the micro level.

        "The Fourth Industrial Revolution era has arrived, according to the World Economic Forum. Everything is changing (viz. artificial intelligence, automation, intelligent robots, self-driving cars and genetic editing) and exciting opportunities accompanied with major challenges come to the surface. On the other hand, major difficulties may also rise, namely technological unemployment and poverty. How can governments, educators and parents prepare the present and future generations to thrive in this increasingly changing world? What is the Education of the Fourth Industrial Revolution age? The education of the new era must transform itself to be able to provide students with the scientific and soft skills needed in the 21st century. Students must actively apply and update their knowledge, must be critical thinkers, problem solvers, curious, imaginative, collaborative, communicators. As Alvin Toffler says in his book Future Shock (1970) 'The illiterate of the 21st century will not be those who cannot read and write, but those who cannot learn, unlearn, and relearn.' DrIVE-MATH—Development of Innovative Mathematical Teaching Strategies in European Engineering Degrees' virtual team was designed to develop a novel and integrated framework to teach math classes in engineering courses, at the university level. Its major goal is to apply novel teaching methodologies to teach math courses to future engineers. DrIVE-MATH emerged from the need to prepare and develop essential competences in engineering students, key to their success in the rapidly changing and dynamic workplace. The teachers involved in the project strongly believe that the implemented active-learning methodologies provide better scientific and soft skills support to the future engineers. In this paper, we present the results of the first year (pilot) implementation of the project DrIVE-MATH at the School of Engineering of the Polytechnic of Porto. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "This study aimed to explore the relationships between students' perceived learning practices and associated self-efficacies regarding mobile-assisted seamless science learning. The learning practices for mobile-assisted seamless science learning questionnaire was developed with three scales that denote learning supported by mobile technology. These scales included authentic learning, self-directed learning, and collaborative learning with information and communication technology. Associated self-efficacies promoted by mobile-assisted seamless science learning could include authentic problem-solving, creative thinking and academic self-efficacy. A sample of 312 primary school students from China responded to the mobile-assisted seamless science learning questionnaire. Confirmatory factor analyses indicated that the mobile-assisted seamless science learning questionnaire had high reliability and validity. The path analysis results analysed via a structural equation modelling technique implied that primary school students' perceived self-directed learning and authentic learning were important as positive predictors for authentic problem-solving efficacy, which may function as a partial mediation variable in the effect of students' perceptions of learning practices on the academic self-efficacy of mobile-assisted seamless science learning. The findings highlighted that learning practices (i.e. authentic learning and self-directed learning) and authentic problem-solving efficacy are both indispensable and mutually reinforcing. This can provide some insights for promoting mobile learning in science learning in the future. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

Second, a series of analyses were conducted to examine differences and relationships among the factors of the TPACK-Games and GTBS, in terms of different school levels. A total of 384 junior high school and elementary school teachers were recruited to complete the surveys. The study found that the TPACK-Games and GTBS surveys were valid and reliable instruments. Further, in comparison with teachers in junior high school, elementary school teachers tended to have higher self-efficacy in game pedagogical knowledge (GPK) and game pedagogical content knowledge (GPCK). They also demonstrated stronger beliefs, confidence and motivation to use games in their classes. Teachers' GPK was the most influential factor in predicting their GPCK, and GPCK further positively predicted their beliefs, confidence and motivation in using games in class.

        "The present study defined three levels of contextualized media and investigated their influences on students' science attitudes, comprehension, and argumentation. To achieve the purpose, an online game‐based science argumentation (OGSA) program was developed for the experiments (N = 148). The OGSA included three versions for student argumentation regarding the use of contextualized medias: the mildly, moderately, and highly contextualized medias. For each version, the students had to play two types of games, find‐the‐fault and find‐the‐difference games, to complete one topic of argumentation learning. We found that the highly contextualized group students had the best performances of their science learning and argumentation. However, to produce highly contextualized media was a time‐consuming task although it provided the students with contextualization cues to connect the learning to their prior knowledge. Lay Description: What is already known about this topic: Teaching argumentation has become increasingly prevalent and also an essential goal for science education.The use of images in learning plays an important role in facilitating students' understanding of science concepts and theories, because it makes the learning contextualizing and can boost the learning outcomes. However, the explanation on the relationship among the use of images, contextualized environment, and learning outcomes remain few.A number of online learning environments were developed to support students' science argumentation. However, few studies based on the elements of gameplay for the design. What this paper adds: The present study defined three levels of contextualized images and investigated their influences on students' science attitudes, comprehension, and argumentation.High school students needed images that are at least moderately contextualized and related to their prior knowledge in order to achieve high‐quality (that is, rational and evidence‐based) argumentation in terms of claims, warrants, rebuttals, and questions.We found that contextualized level of image is a factor significantly affecting on students' learning of science attitudes, comprehension of science concepts, and argumentation. Implications for practice and/or policy: The integration of multiple types of game‐based learning (e.g., find fault and find difference) into the development of online learning environments would constitute an innovative approach for educational instructions.We provided an example on how to integrate different images in terms of their contextualized level into the development of online game‐based program for the learning of science argumentation.

        "• Children can be taught how to use spoken language effectively as a cultural and psychological tool. • This is best achieved by a teacher using an interactive, dialogic pedagogy. • Children's use of Exploratory Talk in group activities promotes the development of reasoning and curriculum learning. • Embedded in a dialogic pedagogy, digital technology can provide valuable support for improving classroom interaction and learning. • The translation of research into classroom practice requires findings to be relevant to teachers' goals and working conditions. This article describes a continuing programme of school-based applied research. The basis of this research, which originated in a project called 'Thinking Together', lies in the relationship between language and cognitive development postulated by sociocultural theory. The research has developed and tested methods for improving the quality of classroom interaction amongst teachers and students, looking for improved levels of collaboration, reasoning, and academic attainment as the desirable outcomes. A key strand of this research concerns the use of digital technology for supporting classroom dialogue and students' emerging thinking over time. As we will explain, the outcomes of several research projects pursuing this line of enquiry have yielded positive results which have direct implications for classroom pedagogy and practice.

        "The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of modelling, collaborative and game-based learning on geometry success in third-grade students. These approaches were applied to geometry instruction in nature on the success of students in geometry. The students' views about geometry activities were also examined. Explanatory design, one of the mixed methods in which qualitative and quantitative methods are both used, was used in the study. The study used a randomized pretest-posttest control group design for the quantitative data; phenomenological study, one of the qualitative research designs, provided the study's qualitative dimension. The study group consisted of 101 third-grade students attending three different public primary schools. There were 65 participants in the experimental group and 36 in the control group. The quantitative data were collected by a geometry success test and the qualitative data were collected through a structured interview form. The quantitative findings obtained at the end of the study revealed that the students' success in geometry was greatest in the modelling group. Qualitative findings showed that geometry activities in nature were more effective than in-class activities. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "In this paper, invention learning curriculum-based serious game contents were designed and developed. Developed serious game contents evaluated effectiveness among elementary school students with participants classified according to enthusiasm for learning and communication condition for a period of first semester. Existing game-based learning contents tend to give too much importance to learning or amusement which has made it difficult to develop contents. To solve the above-mentioned problems, this study designed and developed serious game which strengthened organic combination between amusement and learning. Serious game contents were designed and developed ways which understand invention principle of curriculum as game play. Evaluation of effectiveness showed that serious game is effective in learning of participants in this study. It was ascertained that students with greater enthusiasm for learning who volunteered invention education course showed better recognition of invention and game than those who studied under general curriculum.

        "The purpose of this paper is to explore the implications of the situative perspective in understanding technology acceptance. Briefly, this is the position that holds technology acceptance is influenced by the context of use, which determines the situations and activities in which the technology is employed. Specifically, we review the literature studying the relationship between political engagement and social media use. We examine the link between individuals' political beliefs and political engagement on their acceptance and use of social media extending the core factors of the technology acceptance model. Using a sample drawn from a pre‐university college physics program, we test a structural path model, using WarpPLS, and reproduce the oft‐reported link between social media use and political engagement and showing that social media use for political engagement influences individuals' perceptions of social media technology. These results are interpreted with respect to the situative perspective, specifically, we employ the ecological psychology notion of affordances to understand how social media technology is disrupting traditional political discourse and creating new forum for public discourse and political engagement. Our study demonstrates the value of considering the social dimension in understanding individuals' technology acceptance decisions and behaviors. Understanding the social dimension pf technology acceptance is necessary for modeling user technology acceptance and key to successful implementation initiatives and life cycle management of educational technologies. Practitioner NotesWhat is already known about this topic Using social media varies by individual characteristics and by instrumental use, creating different contexts of use, such as online political engagement.What this paper adds Using social media for political engagement influences perceptions of usefulness and ease of use.A fuller account of technology acceptance must include social and affective determinants in addition to cognitive factors.Implications for practice and/or policy Understanding technology acceptance as a social process requires an account of the purposes and functions of technology within spheres of activity.Thus, understanding the social dimension of technology acceptance appears key area of research for educational technologists working on implementation and life‐cycle management of educational technologies.

        "Set against the backdrop of a succession of educational technology policies in Ireland, influenced by international discourses, this study aimed to explore how Irish pre-service teachers justify the use of mobile technologies in schools. In order to achieve this, 23 pre-service teachers were presented with a vignette that asked them to justify the use of a one-to-one tablet initiative in school. The research found that pre-service teachers tended to justify the initiative, as they saw the increasing technification of schools and society as an inevitable process. In addition, they presented pragmatic reasons for using the technology rather than highlighting their educational/pedagogic value. This study points to the need to challenge pre-service teachers' innovation-centric and techno-centric attitudes towards technology use. It also highlights the need for teacher educators, as a whole, to take a more active role in addressing this issue in teacher education programmes. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "This study investigated primary school teachers' and faculty members' opinions about the teaching practice course identified in the classroom teaching curriculum. Being qualitative in design, participants of this case study were six faculty members assigned with the teaching practice course at a faculty of education affiliated to a state university in Turkey and ten teachers working at practice schools at the time of data collection through the convenient sampling method. Data were collected via a semi-structured interview form developed by the researchers during the 2017-2018 fall semester and analysed through content analysis method. Based on the research findings, the participants have stated that the teaching practice course contributes to candidate teachers especially on putting theory into practice, intramural communication, developing a positive attitude towards teaching profession and gaining experience in the school and classroom setting and that they are confronted with problems related to the course duration and the use of educational technologies in the course. Besides, they have proposed such practical implications as \"increasing the class hours for teaching practice\", \"revision of the existing course curriculum/content\", \"reconstructing the teaching evaluation forms\", \"use of micro-teaching\" and \"increasing the practical course hours of teaching in multi-grade classrooms\".

        "This paper makes a contribution to the developing field of the political economy of educational technology and to an understanding of the significance of digital technologies for home-school relations. The digitalisation of social life is increasing and the impact of digitalisation on home-school relations, parents, and children is under-researched. This article draws on a new qualitative study where fifteen mothers were interviewed about parenting a primary school aged child in England with a focus on digital technologies, home-school relations, and parenting. I argue that processes of digitalisation are contributing to a bureaucratisation of home-school relations. Drawing on Weber's social theory, I argue that managing communications and information is taking precedence over other aspects of parental involvement in education. In this process, digital technologies are contributing to increasing demands for involvement in education that are placed on parents, reinforcing the wider norms of the intensification and professionalisation of parenting.

        "The rise of STEM education, and the twenty first century skills movement, and the increasingly technologically driven nature of our world, has pushed technology education to the fore in recent times. Technology education faces a range of equity issues and there has been a particular focus on gender issues. This study considers two less explored equity issues: school location and socioeconomic status (SES). Using data routinely collected in Victoria, Australia by the Department of Education and Training, senior school technology subject provision, enrolment and achievement patterns were examined by location and SES. Though little difference was found in the academic performance of students from metropolitan or non-metropolitan locations in technology subjects, there were notable differences in participation. Non-metropolitan students were more likely to enrol in design technology and engineering subjects than students attending metropolitan schools. However, while nonmetropolitan student's enrolled in the digital technology subjects at a similar rate to metropolitan students, nonmetropolitan students were less likely to have access to these subjects. Students from lower SES schools tended to perform more poorly in technology subjects than students from high SES backgrounds. Further, the lowest SES schools were the least likely to offer technology subjects. This skewed access to, and performance in, technology subjects by SES and location, highlights significant equity issues in technology education that have attracted only limited attention in the literature.

        "There is considerable evidence that the level of parental involvement is closely associated with children's school outcomes1. Schools are increasingly using digital technology to engage parents, but the impact of such technology on students' learning behaviour is still unclear. This paper reviews and synthesises international evidence from 29 studies to establish whether technology-mediated parental engagement can improve student outcomes. While the review suggests promising evidence in school–parent communication via phone, texts, or emails on children's attainment, attendance, and homework completion, such communications have to be two-way, personalised, and positive. The evidence for home computers and other portable devices is inconclusive. There is no evidence so far that online technological devices and digital media are effective for improving school outcomes. Current research on the use of such technology is weak. Research in this field needs to consider a more careful and scientific approach to improve the evidence base. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "This paper takes an interdisciplinary approach combining digital education with disability theory to investigate disabled children's digital use practices for formal learning. Evidence suggests that children's lives have been transformed through engagement with digital technologies, eg, computers, laptops and mobile devices. Even so, empirical studies about disabled children's uses of technology remain limited, particularly studies that engage with disabled children's own views in context. In response, an exploratory, participatory research study was designed to gain up‐to‐date insights into how visually impaired children, as an illustrative case, experienced digital technologies for learning within the context of inclusive education policy. Disabled children and teachers were interviewed in mainstream schools in England; results were analysed using social practice theory to identify digital use practices characterised as digital learning and digital accessibility practices alongside children's experiences. Outcomes were mixed. Youngsters saw benefits to using digital technologies, particularly tablets, for learning. Nevertheless, digital accessibility practices were potentially stigmatising and carried an extra task load to overcome barriers that occurred when teachers had not developed inclusive digital pedagogy. The paper discusses the implications of these findings and calls for further research to guide schools to use digital technologies to support inclusion. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "Across stages of acquisition, second language (L2) competencies are contingent on the variation among individuals learning the language, in both informal and formal learning contexts. This study investigates a group of outliers whose extreme test scores serve as a foundation to examine them as individuals. The study addresses the outliers' characteristics as good L2 readers but poor first language (L1) readers. Combining quantitative (test results, survey, and language logs) and qualitative (focus groups and interviews) data among 21 adolescents in Norway (aged 16–17 years), the study identifies dimensions of individual language use in L1 Norwegian and L2 English. Findings revealed that they explained their English proficiency by the role of interest and their extensive use of English technology and tools outside school. In‐depth analysis identified three profiles: the Gamer, who spends up to 8 hr daily playing online games while using English mainly; the Surfer, who spends hours on the Internet, searching for authentic language situations, commonly involving English; and the Social Media User, who produces and consumes information in English through social media. Additionally, the Gamers read printed novels voluntarily outside the classroom. This study offers unique perspectives and new directions for future L2 research. Lay Description: What is currently known: Most young people read better in their first language (L1) than in a second language (L2).Young people with an outlier profile read significantly better in L2 English than L1 Norwegian.Internet access facilitates opportunities to improve English skills outside formal schooling. What this paper adds: Outliers develop L2 English reading proficiency due to informal digital technology use.Three different outlier profiles are identified: Gamers, Surfers, and Social Media Users.Most online Gamers also read printed novels voluntarily outside the classroom. Implications of study findings for practitioners: Teachers should bridge English use in the classroom with young people's voluntary use of digital technology.Young people might profit from experiencing a bridging of virtual and physical realities.Their use of digital texts might extend to texts in school, which could help develop L2 reading proficiency.

        "Using digital technology effectively in schools requires profound changes in traditional teaching and learning activities. Pedagogical innovations often start small-scale and developing good ideas into shared practice across schools is challenging in many ways, especially if the innovation requires second-order change, i.e. challenges to fundamental beliefs about teaching and learning. This study investigates how a validated pedagogical method requiring integrated Information and Communication Technology (ICT) use and second-order change can be disseminated and sustained over time. We surveyed 92 primary school teachers who at different times over a 5-year period participated in a training course designed to implement an innovative technology-supported teaching method, Write To Learn, across an entire city. We found that organized teacher development programs can drive second-order change, but this requires considerable, active, and sustained effort from leaders at both school and district level. Additional factors include immediate and extended social systems and handling diversity among teachers. The results are useful for both practitioners and researchers since they contribute to a deeper understanding of the opportunities and challenges involved in disseminating effective ICT-based methods that requires profound changes of thinking about teaching and learning to guide the transformation of teaching practice.

        "There is conflicting research on the value of using digital technology with young children. This study investigated how an app, used in conjunction with dual language picture books, can support the social, emotional, and literacy learning of bi/multilingual children. Twenty-one children used the app Talking Stickers at home and school for four weeks. The classroom was observed and the educators and parents were interviewed and surveyed. The findings indicated that children had enhanced opportunities to practice social, cognitive, and multi-lingual literacy skills, and bonds between home and school were strengthened.

        "The study provides an insight into how teachers may facilitate students' group learning in science with digital technology, which was examined when Norwegian lower secondary school students engaged in learning concepts of mitosis and meiosis. Quantitative and qualitative analyses of the teacher's assistance draw on Galperin's conceptualisation of learning. Findings reveal patterns in the teacher's guidance: the teacher fulfilled the orienting, executive and controlling functions while assisting students in identifying the key features of mitosis and meiosis and solving the compare and contrast task. The teacher relied on and interplayed with the available mediational resources: compare and contrast task, digital animations, and collaborating peers. However, it was the compare and contrast task that demonstrated an approach to study scientific concepts which may have contributed to the development of learners' understanding about to engage in learning in science. By adopting such an approach, learning activity has the potential to not only help students to achieve learning outcomes but it acquires a functional significance, becoming a tool in the learning process aimed at the development of students' as learners. The digital animations, in turn, demonstrated scientific processes that were otherwise invisible for students and triggered group discussions. The study, therefore, raises questions about the need for practitioners' awareness of the type of support the technology and other resources provide to assist both conceptual learning and enhancing students' agency in learning to learn.

        "The ability to self-regulate learning (SRL) is a skill theorized to transfer across learning environments. Students with this ability can consider a learning task, identify a goal, develop a plan to achieve it, execute that plan, and monitor and adapt learning until the goal is met. This paper examines the educational implications of developing the SRL expertise of high and typical-ability students, as operationalized by high school performance, who entered college and struggled with mathematics in their 1st year. Students who initially failed a 6-week intensive college math course completed a 3-h SRL training mid-semester and re-engaged in math learning with an adaptive problem-solving program and resources hosted on a course website. Students trained to evaluate tasks, plan, employ cognitive strategies, and monitor learning behaved distinctly from those who completed a math refresher course. Non-parametric, comparative analyses revealed that SRL-trained students more efficiently mastered math topics during digital problem-solving, demonstrating superior learning efficiency. Under a sequential explanatory mixed methods design, a follow-up multiple case study approach aligned to the Situated Model of SRL traced adaptive learning processes employed by multiple high-ability self-regulators and contrasted them with learning processes of exemplar learners from the untrained group.

        "As the integration of digital technologies in higher education continues to increase, there is a need to understand how to best support university teachers as designers of technology‐enhanced learning (TEL) in order to support students to achieve academic success. In this study, we have examined the Faculty Pedagogical Developer Initiative at KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Sweden, an innovative project to support a bottom‐up change process of teachers as designers of TEL, with the intent to strengthen the professional pedagogical development for the faculty. Data were collected from interviews and official documents. Actor–network theory was applied for the analysis. The results suggest that the initiative stimulated both practical implementation of digital technology in educational programmes and also spurred a debate about teachers as designers of TEL between these pedagogical developers and other teachers across different schools and subjects at KTH. However, there are important social, organisational and technical challenges that should be considered when developing support for university teachers as designers of TEL. This paper concludes that this process requires a deep understanding of four interrelated elements: information, technology, organisation and social arrangements. Practitioner NotesWhat is already known about this topic Faculty interest in applying technology in innovative ways has evolved.Teachers are rarely involved as participatory designers in the TEL contexts.Collaboration among teachers in the TEL design process is an effective strategy.What this paper adds It uncovers dynamics of the bottom‐up change approach of university teachers as designers of TEL interventions.An insight into how the available technology plays a part in transforming teachers' practices.Deeper knowledge about the usefulness of actor‐network theory in empirical HE research.Implications for practice and/or policy There is a need for a critical perspective on supporting university teachers as designers of TEL.Bottom‐up approaches to the faculty pedagogical development in TEL should be continuously supported from the top.Bottom‐up initiatives should be driven by teachers who are recognised for their teacher excellence and trusted among the faculty.

        "Collaborative Digital Text Books (cDTB) are emerging artifacts in Swedish schools, combining the quality assured content of traditional paper and digital text books with affordances for multimodal representation of knowledge, differentiated instruction, communication, collaboration, documentation and with varying learning activities. cDTB are meant to cover the content of the curriculum and provide a consistent learning environment. We analyzed and compared design features in five brands on the market 2017. The analytic comparison indicated that the studied cDTB are built on differing notions of how knowledge is represented as well as on how learners and teachers were supposed to engage with the content. The analysis revealed three types of cDTB distinguished by the way the information and social artifacts are designed. Type 1 resembles a traditional text book with limited multimodal representations of content, tools for working with the content, and tools for communication. Type 2, conversely, is rich in all these aspects but still rely on mainly pre-fabricated content. Type 3 takes a radical approach to content production and leaves it completely up to teachers to produce and share content. The result suggests three very different roles and levels of influence for the cDTB users. Regarding content, the study shows that cDTB are more versatile and quality confirmed learning environments in comparison with: digital \"book in a box\"; learning designs employing scattered digital resources that are not quality assured; and various digital tools that have no clear connection with the curriculum. The paper contributes to practice with the understanding that before starting to use cDTB there is a need to grasp that the choice of digital learning environment is a choice among very different designs.

        "The paper aims to discuss the role of instructional designers (IDs) in supporting the Open Educational Resources (OER) movement in higher education. Due to the increasing cost of higher education, previous studies indicated the feasibility of adopting OER to lower students' educational expenses and to equalize their learning opportunities (Murphy in Distance Education, 34(2), 201–217, 2013; Okamoto in Public Services Quarterly, 9(4), 267–283, 2013). However, many instructors and staff are facing various barriers to adopting OER, such as the lack of time, motivation, and knowledge of quality evaluation (Taylor and Taylor in Online Journal of Distance Learning Administration, 21(2), 1–8, 2018). IDs often serve as learner analysts, instructional innovators, and leaders in educational technology to assist instructors in developing teaching materials. However, limited research studied their partnerships to overcome the barriers of creating and adopting OERs in universities and colleges. Hence, the paper will propose a viable solution to include IDs in overcoming OER adoption barriers and promoting the OER movement in higher education. The findings may contribute to the field of OER movement and pave the way for future research. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "This paper reports on an iterative design‐based research project to develop an online design tool (the Learning Designer) to support \"teachers as designers.\" The aim is to evaluate the potential of the tool to develop and support a knowledge‐building teaching professional community. The Learning Designer was embedded and evaluated through international online \"design challenge\" events, and a series of MOOCs, providing both quantitative and qualitative data. Findings indicate that the Learning Designer enables an online community of teachers from across the K‐12, further and higher education sectors (~400 per day) to build and share their developing knowledge of learning design, and that this would be strengthened by further functionality to support collaboration and peer review of the learning designs created. The research shows how digital technology could bring about large‐scale improvements in teacher professional development of TEL. The paper concludes with users' priorities for new features to mobilise community knowledge via large‐scale professional development of teachers as innovative TEL designers. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "This article presents research from teachers in Northern Ireland who completed a course on 'blended learning' to link schools involved in Shared Education. This is the Northern Ireland policy to bring pupils from different schools together to work collaboratively. Important findings showed that prior to 2017, when teachers received training in blended learning, nearly all contact between their schools was face to face. After the training, teachers stated that the use of a virtual learning environment (VLE) was used as much as face-to-face contact. The VLE had the greatest impact on pupils' knowledge and attitudes towards each other. Teachers reported that this approach made a positive impact on friendship development, the capacity of children to work together, respect for difference and normalising relations between their pupils. Two thirds of the teachers agreed that equal importance be given to online learning and face-to-face contact in future planning. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "This study assesses the use of various technologies, from institutional virtual learning environments to Web 2.0 tools, amongst learners studying at six general Further Education colleges in the UK. The study surveyed 218 students from a range of disciplines and qualifications. Cluster analysis revealed distinct patterns of engagement with technologies in both personal/social and educational contexts. Some support was found for a connection between personal/social and academic uses of technology. In contrast to the dominant narrative of learners as digitally fluent technology users, the analysis showed the majority of learners were using educational technologies in fairly simplistic ways that satisfy the demands of their course. Significant relationships were found between digital practices in college and subject studied and gender. The discussion draws on the literature of digital literacy practices in order to interpret the findings and inform the planning and development of learning technologies. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "Researchers have shown that mentoring has a positive impact on student teachers' professional learning during their practicum, but it can also be highly problematic due to the inherent power roles in mentor-mentee relationships. Via this study, I offer new insights by examining how we can leverage information technology to address the tensions associated with face-to-face mentoring. Using third space theory as a conceptual framework, I examined how group mentoring played out when it was enacted in a digital social semiotic space. Transcripts of online mentoring conversations and semi-structured interviews were analysed using genre and discourse analysis to understand how mentors helped student teachers negotiate tensions of practicum teaching, and how language is used to build ties in online learning environments. The findings suggest that when mentoring is enacted in a third space, mentors and mentees have more opportunities to contest the norms and identities that are associated with traditional mentoring practices operating in schools.

        "Evidence from UK universities' Postgraduate Taught Experience Survey (PTES) concluded that whilst confident and experienced in their area of practice, some find the prospect of returning to study in an on-line environment and making the transition to Master's Level daunting. In recognition of this, a small group created an online resource 'Preparation for study at Master's Level' which students have access to as part of the induction process for the taught postgraduate MSc Advanced Practice in the School of Health and Social Care at Edinburgh Napier University. This paper reports on findings of an evaluation of the on-line induction resource using NOVI survey to explore student's views. 73% of respondents felt that the online resource was helpful in increasing confidence about online learning and studying at Master's level. Qualitative comments reflect other research signifying the importance of social interaction and ongoing support to co-create understanding and development of skills. The lessons learned from students' lived experience informed amendments to both online and face to face content and had an impact on the teaching team by rekindling a programme focus. Though particular to one programme within one university, the findings mirror themes highlighted elsewhere; that transition to Master's level is complex, involving change and exploration of identity and anxiety about what Master's level entails, all of which make for an emotionally challenging experience. Others who support postgraduate students studying at Master's level can learn from this experience. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "Globally, online (or e-learning) environments are growing in popularity in schools and universities. However, the language of instruction in these environments is mostly English. This is a problem as most of the students enrolling into online learning environments in South Africa are non-native English speakers. For these students, English is their second or sometimes third proficient language, which puts them at a disadvantage while accessing information for certain modules. A possible solution is to add same-language subtitles (SLS) to recorded lectures in these online environments to facilitate student learning. Unfortunately, previous studies provided no conclusive evidence of the advantages or disadvantages of adding SLS to a recorded lecture with regard to performance. The participants in this study1 were first-year students (n = 64) in Academic Literacy, majoring in Economics. They were non-native speakers of English with an average English proficiency and were divided into four groups. Each group watched the same recorded lecture in one of the four presentation modes (PMs) (audio, video and video with two types of subtitles). The findings of the study showed no significant effect either on performance or on perceived cognitive load for the students watching a recorded lecture with added subtitles compared to watching without subtitles.

        "Some may say the rise of parochial, sectarian populism has indicated a failure of civic education. On the other hand, it might be said to demonstrate the increasing power of some alternative forms of education. This paper hopes to shed light on how ordinary people learn in ways and through means that are at odds with the experiences of scholars and elites. To do so it explores the intersections of education, technology, and social mobility, to highlight how people learn social class, and learn in classed ways outside schools. In contrast to the dream of information liberty, this article considers how online media is marked by private control of information, often retracing and broadening gaps between social classes. The article provides a theoretical understanding of the relationship between technology and education and the linkages of class and media consumption. It then integrates these topics by exploring how online learning through segmented social media operates to reproduce class and facilitate and mobilize sectarianism. This paper concludes with a recommendation for more focus on the study of class by philosophers interested in education for democracy and social justice. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "Abstract: The current study investigated college students' experiences of a gamified informatics course. We surveyed 139 students aged 18–31 years (M = 20 years, SD = 1.5) enrolled in an undergraduate informatics course focused on social networking technologies. Surveys were conducted at 3 time points during the course (beginning, middle, and end). Overall, we found positive trends with respect to students' perceptions of gamification's impact on their learning, achievement, and engagement in the course material. Although students who played and identified variously with recreational games were more alike than not, we did uncover one notable difference with respect to how students' gaming frequency impacted their engagement in the course. Nongamers expressed somewhat less motivation to do well in the course than frequent gamers. For all other measures of engagement, however, nongamers appeared to be equally engaged by the gamified format of the course as gamers. There were virtually no differences between male and female students' perceptions of gamification. This study contributes new insight into the conditions under which gamification succeeds or fails in educational settings. These insights will be useful to designers and instructors of gamified learning environments as they seek to engage and support a variety of learners. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "This paper proposes a reflection on the evolution of educational technologies and on its impact on school education. Over time, even though with different approaches, methods and tools, educational technology as a field of research has followed substantially two main directions. The first direction has resulted in studies on the new technical and conceptual skills required by digital technologies, the second has focused on the use of ICT to change teaching and learning environments and the way in which curricular subjects are taught. In this paper the evolution of research in educational technology is briefly outlined considering these two orientations. The paper then considers how policy issues influence the large-scale implementation of plans for digital schools with a brief examination of the specific case of Italy. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "This study investigates how pedagogical, cultural and institutional factors interact with technical knowledge in educational technology integration and how they relate to equitable and effective technology use in low‐resource settings. In the context of a one‐to‐one tablet initiative in rural Kenya, we explore how these factors constrain or support access to technology, instructor capacity, student engagement and student learning, as well as their implications for reducing educational and digital divides. We employ a mixed methods, such as a quasi‐experimental (prepost, nonequivalent control group) research design that draws on data from classroom observations, teacher interviews, student surveys and focus groups, and assessments of student academic performance to generate evidence on classroom practices and student learning in schools with access to tablets, while also highlighting core challenges to successful technology integration. Our findings contribute to the identification of prerequisites and supporting factors for successful educational technology integration, as well as policy levers and school‐based strategies that are likely to increase equitable access to quality learning experiences in schools in low‐resource contexts. Practitioner NotesWhat is already known about this topic A lack of funding, planning and infrastructure hinder information and communication technology (ICT) integration.Procurement of educational technology and infrastructure improvement efforts has reduced digital divides, but learning divides persist in implementation.Insufficient teacher technology expertise and professional development constrain teacher's effective use of educational technology in classrooms.What this paper adds We employ mixed methods—triangulating the student assessment data with data from student surveys and focus groups, teacher interviews and classroom observations—to identify how pedagogical, cultural and institutional factors interact with technical knowledge in ICT integration in ways that support or constrain student learning in low‐resource contexts.We find that more attention is needed for cultural factors that interact with pedagogical and technical skills to ensure that the classroom instructors' attention is equitability distributed in ways that discourage in‐class \"tracking\" and differential access to quality learning experiences, such as some teachers' disregard of \"slow learners\" in the classroom.In low‐resource contexts, providing even basic levels of infrastructure (eg, a consistent power source) and access to general technical knowledge requires more creative and concerted efforts from school leadership and instructors, such as the offer of tutorials and reading clubs outside of the class to expand access and improve the use of devices.Implications for practice and/or policy We find that device sharing can have positive effects on peer‐to‐peer learning, which suggests that policymakers in Kenya should weigh the benefits of achieving one‐to‐one device access against the potential advantages of alternative investments, such as expanding professional development on the integration and use of currently available devices.Increasing opportunities for peer‐to‐peer learning and exchange (among teachers and students) and building shared capacities for ICT integration can help reduce technical issues and lost instructional time.

        "This study aimed to identify the impact of a game based learning (GBL) application using computer technologies on student engagement in secondary school science classrooms. The literature reveals that conventional Science teaching techniques (teacher-centered lecture and teaching), which foster rote learning among students, are one of the major concerns in Pakistan Education system. This leads to student disengagement in science lessons eventually resulting in student absenteeism and dropouts from the schools. This study consisted of five stages: (1) examining the impact of Digital Game-Based Learning (DGBL) and gamification on engagement, learning and gender difference, and literature related to using DGBL models for instructional design; (2) planning learning activities and developing a GBL application based on a specific content in Science; (3) conducting an intervention with a sample of 72 participants of 8th grade (aged 12-15) in a low cost private school of Pakistan following quasi-experimental research framework; (4) observing behaviour and emotions of the participants during science lessons; (5) conducting pre and post tests to assess the learning outcomes of participants followed by focus groups discussion. Analysis from Friedman test, Mann-Whitney U test, and Wilcoxon Signed Rank test show that the GBL application has a positive influence on student engagement. However, GBL application was not equally effective for all students since girls outperformed boys in terms of engagement and learning outcomes. This study gives insights into the development of better educational games to promote student learning. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "Disparities in the technology practices, skills and knowledge of school students still exist, despite widespread investment, and use in schools. In order to understand why inequalities remain, we first need a more nuanced understanding of students' technology practice, including understanding how their backgrounds, circumstances and experiences shape their perceptions of and engagement with technology. This paper proposes that research in the field of educational technology would benefit from a sociological framing in order to highlight how and why students use technology at school and in their everyday lives. The paper reports on a qualitative embedded case study of 13–16‐year‐old students in two Australian secondary schools. In‐depth case studies of two selected students illustrate the complex nature of students' technology practice. Bourdieu's concepts of field, habitus and capital are used as a lens through which to view and understand inequalities in students' technology practice. The findings demonstrate the utility of sociological theory in educational technology research by highlighting systems and structures of reproduction and transformation. Furthermore, the findings can inform an approach to teaching and learning that considers students' varied experiences, knowledge, perspectives and backgrounds relating to technology.

        "This article presents Bourdieu's theory of practice as a tool for exploring school students' technology practice in empirical research. The authors provide educational technology researchers with an accessible introduction to the theory of practice. They then detail the conceptual, methodological and analytic application of the theory of practice in two educational technology studies. The application of the theory in the two studies highlights the potential of the sociological framing for informing a robust critical research agenda and understanding the circumstances that can contribute to digital inequalities. Practically, knowledge gained through theoretically informed research is critical for researchers, governments, schools and teachers in working to overcome digital inequalities.

        "Retaining learners and facilitating their continuance are critical for the mobile learning providers and educators. Drawing on stimulus‐organism‐response framework and self‐determination theory, this study examines factors that affect college students' mobile learning continuance by considering the self‐determination needs and learning involvement. A research model was developed and empirically tested against data collected from 309 college students who are the mobile learning users of an online education platform in China. The results of structural equation modeling analysis showed that perceived learning support, self‐management of learning and peer influence significantly influence affective learning involvement, which in turn positively affect mobile learning continuance intention. In addition, perceived learning support and peer influence also significantly influence cognitive learning involvement, which further determine mobile learning continuance intention. Theoretical and practical implications of these findings are also discussed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "Digital technology is an expanding area of education policy. There is growing interest, therefore, in how networks of corporate and state policy actors implicit in the formation of (inter)national education technology agendas intersect with local school systems and teachers. In particular, this paper explores the significant policy work that takes place outside schools and classrooms through education trade shows. Based on an in-depth ‘event ethnography’ of one large Scandinavian educational technology show, the paper details how these events function as sites of policy interpretation - ‘sharing’ (or more accurately ‘selling’) global ideas and imperatives to local schools and teachers. These findings highlight the role of trade shows in consolidating policy networks, subsuming public education interests into corporate concerns, and differentiating teacher subjectivities and encouraging teacher entrepreneurship. The paper problematizes the ways in which teacher agency is shaped and controlled by the discursive, material and affective dimensions of such events. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "Advanced by powerful venture philanthropies, educational technology companies, and the US Department of Education, a growing movement to apply ‘big data’ through ‘learning analytics’ to create ‘personalized learning’ is currently underway in K-12 education in the United States. While scholars have offered various critiques of the corporate school reform agenda, the role of personalized learning technology in the corporatization of public education has not been extensively examined. Through a content analysis of US Department of Education reports, personalized learning advocacy white papers, and published research monographs, this paper details how big data and adaptive learning systems are functioning to redefine educational policy, teaching, and learning in ways that transfer educational decisions from public school classrooms and teachers to private corporate spaces and authorities. The analysis shows that all three types of documents position education within a reductive set of economic rationalities that emphasize human capital development, the expansion of data-driven instruction and decision-making, and a narrow conception of learning as the acquisition of discrete skills and behavior modification detached from broader social contexts and culturally relevant forms of knowledge and inquiry. The paper concludes by drawing out the contradictions inherent to personalized learning technology and corporatization of schooling. It argues that these contradictions necessitate a broad rethinking of the value and purpose of new educational technology. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "Close links between students' conceptions of and approaches to learning were established in the past research. However, only a few quantitative studies investigated this relationship particularly with regard to mobile learning (m‐learning). The correlation between learners' conceptions and approaches to m‐learning was analysed using a partial least squares analysis applied to data obtained from a sample of 971 undergraduate students in China. The results indicated that students' conceptions of m‐learning could be classified into reproductive, transitional, and constructive levels. Students may hold multiple m‐learning applications than a predominant one; hence, examining m‐learning as one monolithic entity may provide limited information. Latent profile analysis identified four learning profiles based on students' preferred m‐learning applications: passive, mixed, surface‐supportive, and high‐engagement.. Moreover, a general trend was observed, whereby students with reproductive and surface‐supportive learning profiles showed a tendency to adopt surface approaches, whereas those expressing constructive and mixed learning profiles were more inclined to adopt deep approaches. Interestingly, students with transitional conceptions and high‐engagement learning profiles tended to take both surface and deep approaches. Lay Description: What is already known about this topic Previous studies have confirmed that conceptions of learning are closely linked with approaches to learning that tend to influence on learning performance.Conceptions of ubiquitous learning/mobile learning (m‐learning) appeared a hierarchy, ranging from reproductive to constructivist conceptions. What this paper adds This study indicated that students' conceptions of m‐learning can be classified into reproductive, transitional, and constructive levels. Accordingly, the results of the latent profile analysis revealed four learning profiles that were able to characterize students in terms of their critical applications of m‐learning, namely, the high‐engagement, mixed, surface‐supportive, and passive m‐learning profiles.A general trend was observed, whereby students with reproductive and surface‐supportive learning profiles showed a tendency to adopt surface approaches, whereas those expressing constructive and mixed learning profiles were more inclined to adopt deep approaches. Interestingly, students with transitional conceptions and high‐engagement learning profiles tended to take both surface and deep approaches. Implications for practice and/or policy The structure relationship between conceptions of and approaches to m‐learning and the role of different m‐learning profiles in approaches to m‐learning deepened the understanding of m‐learning processes and outcomes.In order to develop suitable approaches to m‐learning and motivations specific to Chinese educational context, college educators and teachers might consciously guide students to cultivate their perceptions of m‐learning based on the findings in this study.

        "After working with a number of scholars for two years, a university designed a mobile learning platform referred to as 'College English IV,' where learners could have easy access to various kinds of learning resources through installing the program in their smart phones. This study aims to identify whether this platform could significantly improve the proficiency of English as a foreign language (EFL), yield learner satisfaction, and reduce learners' cognitive loads in EFL classes. Randomly selected 340 tertiary students participated in the study. After quantitative multivariate analysis and qualitative interview data analysis, it was concluded that: (1) In EFL classes, participants with the mobile learning platform were more satisfied than those without it; (2) In EFL classes, learning outcomes of participants with the mobile learning platform improved significantly more than those without it; and (3) In EFL classes, cognitive loads of participants with the mobile learning platform were significantly lower than those without it. Interdisciplinary research may be needed in future research. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "Abstract: In this paper, we argue that in order to gain a deeper understanding of collaborative mobile learning in schools, it is important to know not only how mobile devices affect collaborative learning but also how collaborative learning emerges and is mediated by these devices. We develop our argument by applying the instrumental genesis theory and the collective instrumented activities and situations model for the analysis of learners' collaborative learning in the tablet‐mediated classroom. This analysis is grounded in data collected in four elementary Swedish schools (ie, from fourth to eighth grade). From the data, we considered the learners' conversation in English as a foreign language, inquiry‐based learning in the natural sciences classroom and game‐based learning in the arithmetic classroom. On the one hand, the scrutiny of these specific activities led us to distinguish the pragmatic, epistemic, and reflexive instrumental mediations that have already been theorized in the instrumental genesis theory. On the other hand, they helped us to identify two additional ones, which we call emotional and spatial. Based on these findings, we claim that collaboration in the tablet‐mediated classroom is a complex activity that emerges from a variety of instrumental mediations that configure contemporary collaborative mobile learning.

        "The rapid growth in diversity of information and communication technologies (ICT) enables a range of teaching methods, learning support strategies, and education settings to be developed. Questions about appropriate, effective, and efficient use of educational technology in teaching mathematics have been gaining more attention. This study focuses on the design and testing of an interactive learning textbook (eBook), created with Geogebra applets and up-to-date web technologies. The eBook is designed to meet the pedagogical and didactic needs of learners, allowing a high degree of interactivity and feedback during the learning process. In order to determine the effect of the created materials on students' achievements, tests of knowledge as well as tests of retention of knowledge were used. Moreover, questionnaires and interviews for students were developed to assess the impact of interactive textbooks on the perceptions of learners concerning mathematics, interactive materials, and the learning process. Students who have used the interactive eBook show statistically significant increased knowledge and knowledge retention compared to students who have attended the standard classes. Students also emphasized that tasks with interactive applets and new kind of learning materials inspired them to learn more, both in school and at home. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "This paper outlines the growing phenomenon and need to integrate technologies into mathematics and science teaching and learning. There are a number of successful projects for valuable integration of technologies around the world' however, these successes are often limited reaching a relatively small number of teachers and students. In this paper, we aim to offer examples of large-scale technology projects that could create a critical mass of users that could further drive innovation and sustainability for educational technology integration. We outline how GeoGebra became one of the most widely used dynamic mathematics software with a user base of more than 100 million; highlight directions of research for technology development and integration; and describe the Geomatech project that aimed to train 2500 teachers in 950 schools in Hungary. We hope that such examples, the developed technology, resources and pedagogies could contribute to further valuable integrations of technologies in mathematics and science education.

        "The proliferation of mobile computing technologies is playing major role in the growth of mobile learning (M-learning) market around the globe. The purpose of this paper is to develop a research model in the lines of commonly used models the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) and Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) by incorporating constructs namely flexibility learning, social learning, efficiency learning, enjoyment learning, suitability learning, and economic learning that can predict M-learning adoption in a developing country. The data were collected from 388 students from all major universities/colleges in the capital city (Muscat) of Oman. The neural network modeling was employed to predict M-learning adoption. The neural network modeling results showed that flexibility learning, social learning, efficiency learning, enjoyment learning, suitability learning, and economic learning variables have significant influence on the intention of students to accept mobile learning. The key outcomes of this study suggest important determinants that can assist academic administrators and telecommunication service providers to enhance the adoption of M-learning with the help of suitable strategy.

        "The complexity of medical education and healthcare systems is a 'wicked problem'. Change will be a continuous iteration between evaluation and revaluation. Medicine is a social science. It is about people, societies and human interaction and communication. Medical College of the future should be developed in the light of social constructivism theories. Students from year one, day one, should be embedded in the work environment. Academic Healthcare Systems will be the norm not the exceptional. The training of students will be in all healthcare related facilities in the community. Public-private partnership in education and research will spread and become more regulated and encouraged. The students who want to be the future physicians should be selected differently. The curriculum will be more context related. Entrustable professional activities will be measured more frequently at different points of the students learning trajectory. Research and innovation will be integral to the students' learning experience. They should be exposed to how researchers think and behave and be embedded in a research environment. The medical college of the future will be using advanced technology which will be disruptive and transform existing educational models. E-Learning materials will be shared by consortia of collaborating medical colleges from all around the world. Artificial intelligence and machine learning will influence how students learn. National and international accreditation systems should ensure quality, but not stifle innovation. Physical learning spaces should reflect and express the underlying assumptions about \"what is learning and teaching?\". This should be reflected and expressed through the design of its buildings, infrastructure, technology, furniture and out of class learning environment. Predicting the future is difficult in a rapidly changing world. Next generation physicians should be competent in treating the next generation of patients while maintaining the health of the population. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "In this study, we explore the potential of a natural language processing (NLP) approach to support discourse analysis of in‐situ, small group learning conversations. The theoretical basis of this work derives from Bakhtin's notion of speech genres as bounded by educational robotics activity. Our goal is to leverage computational linguistics methods to advance and improve educational research methods. We used a parts‐of‐speech (POS) tagging program to automatically parse a transcript of spoken dialogue collected from a small group of middle school students involved in solving a robotics challenge. We grammatically parsed the dialogue at the level of the trigram. Then, through a deliberative process, we mapped the POS trigrams to our theoretically derived problem solving in computational environments coding system. Next, we developed a stacked histogram visualization to identify rich interactional segments in the data. Seven segments of the transcript were thus identified for closer analysis. Our NLP‐based approach partially replicated prior findings. Here, we present the theoretical basis for the work, our analytical approach in exploring this NLP‐based method, and our research findings. Practitioner NotesWhat is already known about this topic Over the last 10 years, several educational research papers indicate that natural language processing (NLP) techniques can be used to help interpret well‐structured, written dialogue, eg, conversations in online class discussions.Two recent papers indicate that NLP techniques can also be used to help interpret well‐structured, spoken dialogue, eg, replies to interview questions and/or comments made during think aloud protocols.Multimodal learning analytic techniques are being used to investigate collaborative learning. These studies use non‐verbal features of data (gaze, gesture, physical actions), prosodic features of verbal data (pitch and tone) and/or turn‐taking and duration of talk per speaker data, as means of predicting group success. None of the MMLA studies attempt semantic analysis of student talk in collaborative settings.What this paper adds A theoretical framework for why and how an automated NLP approach can support discourse analysis research on co‐located, computer‐based, collaborative problem solving interactions. This framework, entitled the Problem Solving in Computational Environment Speech Genre, links children's physical interactions with computational devices to their verbal exchanges and presents a theoretical rationale for the use of NLP methods in educational research.Description of an interdisciplinary method that combines NLP techniques with qualitative coding approaches to support analysis of student collaborative learning with educational robotics.Identification of student learning outcomes derived from the semantic, PSCE Speech Genre and NLP approach.Implications for practice and/or policy Educational researchers will be able to expand upon our findings towards the goal of using computation and automation to support microgenetic analysis of large datasets.Robust microgenetic learning findings will provide curriculum developers, educational technology developers and teachers with guidance on how to construct and or create learning materials and environments.From an interdisciplinary perspective, this research can support more interdisciplinary exploration of conversational dialogues that are ill‐structured, indexical and referential. This research will support the further development of machine learning techniques and neural network models by computational linguists. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "The purpose of this study was to determine the cross-cultural validity of a collective achievement goal model using a sample of non-music-major college band students from the US and Singapore. The study was situated within a theoretical framework that posited individual and collective achievement goal orientations of mastery-approach, mastery-avoidance, performance-approach, and performance-avoidance. These constructs were also examined in relation to three adaptive learning outcomes: flow, grit, and commitment to band. Confirmatory factor analyses indicated that whether considering the US, the Singapore, or the entire sample, the collective 2 × 2 achievement goal framework yielded a superior fit to the data when compared with four competing dichotomous and trichotomous models. Model invariance testing found that although the collective 2 × 2 achievement goal model appears to fit fairly well to the data from both groups of participants, cross-cultural model invariance can only be claimed conditionally. Hierarchical regression indicated that independent of any variation already explained by achievement goal sub-scales from the individual perspective, scales from the collective perspective explained a small but significant increase in variance for flow.

        "There is increased interest in the use of gamification as an innovative practice in the field of training and education. Based on the use of game mechanics, gamification aims at engaging students in their learning. However, there is not much research on the use of gamification in school settings, especially when it comes to foreign language learning; hence, we know little about to what extent this aim is actually fulfilled. This study intends to contribute to filling this research gap. Silva’s four dimensions of play - built from Henriot’s theory of play - are used as an analytical framework to study a teaching situation where a gamified application, developed for this research project, was introduced in a French-as-a-foreign-language class in a Norwegian upper secondary school. This article focuses on the students’ engagement in their learning activities and their control over the tasks. The interaction analysis of video data reveals that students are indeed showing expressions of playfulness and autonomy. The analysis also shows that the students are engaged in the activity and are voluntarily completing additional language tasks. These findings are promising for the use of gamified resources in foreign language learning classes. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "Abstract: In the last two decades, game‐based learning environments have evolved into powerful learning tools. With the growth and evolution in complexity of these innovations, complementary work in game‐based assessment design has also begun to take shape and has generated considerable interest among a variety of education stakeholders. This is in part due to their ability to offer real‐time, adaptive and integrated formative feedback. As the use of digital devices and digital learning tools continues to expand in schools, the potential for harnessing learning data becomes increasingly possible and powerful. Yet there are inherent tensions and challenges in the nature of collecting assessment data inside a game‐based learning environment which confront our foundational premises of what makes for a good assessment.

        "This study aimed to explore the features of mobile learning behaviors among Chinese elementary school students, and relationships between mobile learning behaviors and personal characteristics in mobile learning environment. The current study designed and developed a game-based educational mobile environment and conducted an experimental research. Eighty-three elementary students participated in this study. The results revealed the features of elementary school students’ mobile learning behavior including: 1) the students had reasonable login frequencies and learning time duration with appropriate guidance from the teachers, and satisfying learning performance by self-learning; 2) higher grade, learning style with active information processing and higher test scores in the conventional Chinese subject course had positive impacts on the mobile learning behaviors, but no gender difference was found. Regrettably, students showed more digital consuming than digital creating in the current study. The results could provide necessary suggestions on mobile learning for young learners.

        "This survey of 335 practitioners builds on research which challenged the view that educational technologies are rarely used in early years settings. Previous research tends to focus on individual devices. This research looks at the range of devices being used and, instead of investigating how often they are used, considers how they support pedagogical practice. Findings support the view that early years practitioners are accessing a wider range of technologies and that these technologies are being used in more pedagogically appropriate ways than has previously been reported. Educational technologies appear to be increasingly embedded within early years education. Overall, attitudes towards educational technology are positive. Beliefs, however, are more likely to be linked to the social rationale, that children need access to technology because they are surrounded by it in everyday life, than the pedagogical rationale, that technology enhances learning. It may be necessary to review documentation to ensure that policy and practice focus more specifically on learning and teaching. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "In recent years, numerous English vocabulary learning-assisted apps have been developed to enlarge learners' English vocabulary through mobile learning. However, the ability of learners to engage in self-regulated learning (SRL) importantly affects performance in autonomously learning English vocabulary using mobile apps. Therefore, this study developed an English vocabulary learning app with a self-regulated learning mechanism (EVLAPP-SRLM) to help learners improve their SRL abilities, with a view to improving their learning performance and motivation in a mobile learning context. To evaluate the performance of the proposed EVLAPP-SRLM, a total of 46 Grade 5 students were recruited from two classes in an elementary school of Taoyuan City, Taiwan, to participate in the experiment. The two classes were randomly assigned to the experimental or control groups, which used, respectively, the EVLAPP-SRLM and the English vocabulary learning app without a self-regulated learning mechanism (EVLAPP-NSRLM) to support their English vocabulary learning during a period of two weeks. Experimental results indicate that the learners in the experimental group exhibited significantly better learning performance and motivation than those in the control group. Moreover, the learners who used EVLAPP-SRLM exhibited significantly greater learning performance and motivation than those who used EVLAPP-NSRLM, regardless of gender. Analytical results also verify that the EVLAPP-SRLM provides more benefits to field-dependent learners than to field-independent learners with respect to learning performance and motivation.

        "The rise of mobile learning in schools during the past decade has led to promises about the power of mobile learning to extend and enhance student cognitive engagement. The purpose of this study was to examine trends to determine the cognitive level students are involved in within mobile learning activities. This systematic review involved an aggregated and configurative synthesis of PK‐12 mobile learning studies from 2010 to 16 and used Bloom's Taxonomy as a theoretical framework for categorizing the cognitive level of student activities. Major new findings include that students are involved in activities at all six levels of Bloom's Taxonomy. This study shows that over 60% of researchers are developing activities that require high levels of cognitive processing, a large increase from past studies. Nonetheless, 40% are integrating mobile devices in ways that keep students working with minimal cognitive processing. In both elementary and secondary studies, there was a 40/60% split in the use of lower versus high level thinking opportunities. New findings show that mobile devices were integrated into science, mathematics, social studies, literacy, art and special education. Studies in science settings were the majority of the studies (40%), followed by literacy (24%). [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "This article discusses the use of mobile devices by teachers in two Australian schools. It builds on a theoretical framework which considers the location of mobile learning with respect to time and space. The research used a qualitative methodology in which observations, interviews and document analysis were conducted. The study found that the physical and virtual spaces that were used were different from those used in other lessons. Mobile learning facilitated autonomous learning by students, collaboration with their peers and engagement in topics of interest to them. The study found that students and teachers adopted new roles when using the devices, and were untethered from their conventional learning spaces of the classroom. Learning changed in nature and was aligned with contemporary practices in education. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "There has been a recent acceleration in the use of lecture capture technologies (LCT) in higher education institutions. The present study focuses on an LCT system, by the name of ClassBoost, which has recently been introduced in some classes in an academic college of education in Israel. The system encourages collaborative learning skills at different levels, and the research focused on the students' attitudes towards the system from a procedural viewpoint at two stages of its assimilation: before the use of the system and during its use. Emphasis is given to the students' collaborative learning patterns and learning practices from their own viewpoints. A unique finding is that students felt that their participation in lessons contributed to the effectiveness of the teaching. The research aims to supplement existing research on the use of LCT systems, this time in teacher education, and to point up practical implications, especially for academic colleges of education. Lay Description: What is already known about this topic: Use of lecture capture technologies (LCT) in higher education has recently increased.Online collaborations involve knowledge construction and problem‐solving.Collaborative online learning increases satisfaction and trust in studied knowledge. What this paper adds: The ClassBoost system encouraged collaborative learning in an Israeli college of education.Nevertheless, the potential of collaborative learning was not sufficiently exploited.Clarifies implications of innovative technology: ClassBoost system for student teachers. Implications for practice and/or policy: Students should receive specific guidance to recognize the system's potential for learning.Teacher‐educators need training to help students to exploit the system's possibilities.

        "In recent years, there has been an increase in the popularity of personalized learning (PL) and educational technology in American K-12 schools. In particular, school models that use technology to deliver personalized learning experiences for students have proliferated. Still, few studies have investigated these phenomena in K-12 contexts, with no studies to date examining the implementation and evolution of PL models over time. Toward closing this gap in the current literature on PL models, this qualitative case study uses Activity Theory to understand how and why a PL school in the United States evolved from its inaugural year through its third year of implementation. Findings indicate that the school exhibited substantive changes in organizational practice rooted in: (1) a disconnect between vision and practice; (2) the implementation of a 'No Excuses' model and the school-level prioritization of accountability; and (3) the reprioritization of PL. Implications for educators and organizations interested in developing and implementing PL are discussed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "Currently there are few pedagogical models available for mathematics teachers who are interested in digital game‐based learning. The Play Curricular‐activity Reflection and Discussion (PCaRD) model attempts to address this, but lacks the needed exploratory research on its implementation within formal mathematics classrooms. Through the use of semi‐structured interviews, this study examined three middle school teachers' initial experience using PCaRD, the influence of this experience on their digital game‐based learning knowledge, and their perceptions on how teaching with digital games impacts student achievement. The findings showed teachers feel PCaRD is a sound Pedagogical model, but needed more practice using it to fully realize its usefulness. Also teachers felt the need to make adaptions to PCaRD based on the composition of their class, and had difficulty implementing the reflection and discussion phases. Finally, teachers felt their low achieving students benefitted most from the use of digital games. Future directions for research are also discussed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "Abstract This study reports on the effectiveness of an early reading intervention, based on current research on early reading acquisition, and aligned to Norwegian orthography. Thirteen schools were randomly assigned to one of two interventions or a control condition. First grade students (n = 744) were screened at school entry, and children at risk of reading difficulties (n = 140) were identified. At-risk students in schools allocated for intervention received comprehensive teacher-led instruction also containing an individually-delivered computer component. The only difference between the two interventions was whether the computer application had adaptive learning features. Both interventions had significant impact on reading and spelling with no significant difference between the two different intervention conditions. Findings indicate that Norwegian children identified to be at-risk at school entry can profit from intensive intervention that combines training in letter knowledge with explicit instruction in phonetic decoding and word recognition, free spelling, connected text reading and shared reading. Highlights • A multi-component reading intervention for students at risk for RD is proposed. • The proposed intervention is evaluated in a sample of Norwegian first graders. • Intervention students outperform controls on reading and spelling after treatment. • Adaptive and fixed computer applications are evaluated and found equally effective. • At-risk children receiving intervention showed parallel growth with not-at-risk.

        "Geometry instruction is an important yet often overlooked subject in current education research and practice. This study synthesized intervention studies focusing on instruction to improve geometry skills for K-12 students with and without disabilities. Thirty two studies met the inclusion criteria: being published in English-language peer-reviewed journals or dissertations between 1980 and 2015, using quantitative method, and targeting kindergarten through twelfth grade students in the United States. Five studies examined the effectiveness of new geometry curricula, sixteen studies investigated instructional strategies, and eleven studies explored educational technologies. Although a broad range of geometric subjects were covered for normal achieving students, most of the studies for students with special needs primarily focused on very basic geometry skills. Only one study was found about teaching geometry to kindergarteners. Limitations and directions for future research are discussed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "The educational recommendation system to provide support for academic guidance and adaptive learning has always been an important issue of research for smart education. A bad guidance can give rise to difficulties in further studies and can be extended to school dropout. This paper explores the potential of Educational Data Mining for academic guidance recommendation by predicting students' performance which involves analyzing data of students' records, socio-economic data and of course the student's motivation. The proposed model was analyzed and tested using student's data collected from the preparatory classes for \"Grandes Ecoles\" Reda Slaoui (CPGE) - Morocco. More specifically, it proposes the use of three models that were applied on real data: Decision tree, Naive Bayes, and Neural networks. The data include the classes period (2012-2014 and 2013-2015) of 330 students in specialty the grade Mathematical Physics (MP) and Engineering Sciences (MPSI). The performance results indicate that our framework can make more accurate predictions of students' performance. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "Educational Technology (ETEC) professionals in the United States (US) fill multiple roles in public school systems. While these roles can be classified into broad categories, what remains unclear are the expectations and priorities for the completion of these roles and the tasks associated within each role category. In order for ETEC professionals to be successful, they need clear guidance on what their performance expectations and prioritized roles should be. This research seeks to add clarity regarding expectations by surveying K-12 building administrators to identify perceptions of ETEC professionals within their schools regarding their actual and ideal performances relative to eight role categories. Results indicate that these US building administrators place high importance on the Technological and Administrative Communication categories. The data also show that there is a significant gap between the ideal and actual performance expectations of ETEC professionals in all eight role categories, but most demonstrably within the Instructional Support and Teaching/Training categories. Results also signal the desire for ETEC professionals to focus more on training and collaboration with teachers regarding technology integration within classrooms. This suggests that administrators want ETEC professionals to complete more instructional tasks than they currently perform. Findings from this study hold implications for the training of ETEC professionals and can potentially inform the curriculum of educational technology preparation programs in the US and beyond.

        "Flipped learning (FL) has had a substantial impact on higher education worldwide, prompting active dialog among educational researchers and practitioners. It is widely accepted that the value of FL lies in enabling in‐depth, learner‐centered learning experiences by offloading content delivery onto pre‐class online learning. The in‐class component is thus generally considered more critical, even though both pre‐class and in‐class elements are indispensable components of FL and practitioners are faced with the issue of under‐prepared learners. In this study, we examine the significance of pre‐class learning as a gateway to the intended benefits of FL. We aim to investigate the extent to which FL pre‐class learning influences overall FL success and what other factors affect FL pre‐class learning to ascertain the implications of designing and implementing FL pre‐class learning. A college life science course was designed and implemented with the FL model for a semester, from which data were collected and statistically analyzed. The results indicate that the influence of pre‐class learning on final FL success is significant and strong. Regarding the modality of pre‐class learning materials, learners demonstrated higher levels of performance in the weeks with video materials than during those with reading materials. Among several learner factors, self‐direction was found to significantly influence pre‐class learning performance and perceived learning readiness. The role of FL pre‐class learning to attain the intended value of FL is discussed, and theoretical and practical design implications are suggested. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "Preparing competent staff is a critical issue within the camp community. This quasi-experimental study examined the effectiveness of an online course for improving staff competency in camp healthcare practices among college-aged camp staff and a comparison group (N = 55). We hypothesized that working in camp would increase competency test scores due to opportunities for staff to experientially apply knowledge learned online. Hierarchical linear modeling was used to analyse the cross-level effects of a between-individuals factor (assignment to experimental or comparison group) and within-individual effects of time (pre-test, post-test #1, and post-test #2) on online course test scores. At post-test #2, the difference in average test scores between groups was ~30 points, with the treatment group scoring lower on average than the comparison group. Factors that may have influenced these findings are explored, including fatigue and the limited durability of online learning. Recommendations for research and practice are discussed.

        "The integration of digital game-based learning environment (DGBLE) enhanced by technology in recent years has been hampered by its complexity and difficulty in realistically addressing teachers’ instructional needs. The pedagogical gap between what teachers think a DGBLE can deliver and what DGBLE can actually offer remains substantial. To preliminarily address the gap, this present qualitative study adopted an end-user-development lens to understand how K-12 teachers as novice end users interpret and design game features in their DGBLEs. The design ideas, situated in teaching scientific subjects, were collected from 19 pre-service teachers in a public university in the United States by semi-structured interviews based on game features identified in the literature. The data analysis, grounded in the ARCS (attention, relevance, confidence, satisfaction) motivational design model, employed the direct content analysis method and revealed the distribution of motivational support among participants’ DGBLEs design ideas. The finding suggested that participants were more likely to incorporate intrinsic motivational support than extrinsic support in their design. This trend could compromise the motivational support of DGBLEs when students need additional extrinsic motives toward the end of learning processes. Further, the study illuminates the importance of incorporating end users’ perspectives early on in the DGBLE design process. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "This quantitative research examined the contribution of an Online Collaborative Learning (OCL) program on attitudes towards technology in terms of technological anxiety, self-confidence and technology orientation among M.Ed. students. The advanced online collaborative program was implemented at two teacher training colleges in Israel for a period of 10 weeks. It was based on the TEC model that used technology to increase trust between students from different cultures through online learning. Students from the intervention group (N = 47) and the control group (N = 45) completed questionnaires which dealt with their level of collaboration, intrinsic motivation, satisfaction, and attitudes towards technology. Findings of the SEM path analysis indicated that a high level of OCL promoted positive attitudes to technology. Thus, involving students in OCL programs could reduce technological anxiety and increase technological self-confidence and technological liking. However, students’ motivation and satisfaction were found to have a strong effect on the change of attitudes towards technology in OCL environments. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "The finding that under split‐attention conditions students learn more from a picture and spoken text than from a picture and written text (ie, the modality effect) has consistently been found in many types of computer‐assisted multimedia learning environments. Using 58 fifth‐grade and sixth‐grade elementary school children as participants, we investigated whether the modality effect can also be found in a mobile learning environment (MLE) on plants' leaf morphology, in which students had to learn by integrating information from text and real plants in the physical environment. A single factor experimental design was used to examine the hypothesis that students in a mixed‐mode condition with real plants and spoken text (STP condition) would pay more attention to the real plants, and achieve higher performance on retention, comprehension, and transfer tests than the single‐mode condition with real plants and written text (WTP condition). Whereas we found that participants in the STP condition paid more attention to observing the plants, and achieved a higher score on the transfer test than participants in the WTP condition, no differences were found between the conditions for retention and comprehension test performance.

        "A prerequisite for low‐stakes activities to improve learning is to keep students engaged when confronted with challenging material. Comparing a personalized and non‐personalized version of computerized practising, this study experimentally evaluates the relationships between student effort and ability across different dimensions of task perceptions. Students practise longer when the task is perceived to be not too difficult. Students assigned to a personalized version of the tool have a lower success rate while practising, but this does not translate to differences in practice intensity, task perceptions, or summative test scores. In a personalized practising environment, perceived interest and usefulness both have the potential to promote engagement, albeit in different ways. Students with a lower level of subject‐specific ability find the tool more interesting and, particularly, consider the non‐personalized tool difficult but useful. Instead, in the personalized condition, it is the group of students with higher prescores who value the tool as relatively useful. These results indicate that more students will remain engaged with adaptive practising if software takes into account such differences. Multiple approaches and algorithms may thus be necessary to optimally adapt practising to individual learners. Lay Description: What is already known about this topic: A prerequisite for low‐stakes activities to improve learning is to keep students engaged when confronted with challenging material.Educators are generally optimistic that adaptive software in education has the potential to boost student learning outcomes.Obvious challenges remain in keeping school‐aged adolescents engaged throughout the learning process with digital learning tools used in low‐stakes settings. What this paper adds: Task perceptions regarding low‐stakes practising relate empirically to differential patterns of student engagement and performance for students of different ability.The impact of personalization on task perceptions evolves over time as students acquire more experience with the learning tool.Perceived interest and usefulness of working with digital learning tools both have the potential to promote engagement, albeit in different ways and only for students working in a personalized environment.High‐ability students assign higher usefulness to adaptive practising, which, relative to nonadaptive practising, is relatively difficult and lowers the success rate. Implications for practice and/or policy: When adaptive practising is implemented as a relatively low‐stakes activity, perceived usefulness is important in safeguarding student effort.More students will remain engaged with practising if adaptive software takes into account student differences (e.g., ability) and preferences (e.g., test preparation).Effective computerized personalized practising asks for a more comprehensive approach as to promote engagement of all students.

        "Highlights • Digital learning systems provide feedback on student progress to guide curricular adaptations. • A class's progress along learning trajectories helps teachers diagnoses student difficulties. • Feedback affects short- and long-term curricular decision-making by teachers. • Curricular adaptation can be guided by data on a class's progress along learning trajectories. • Diagnostic assessment data can help strengthen teachers' professional knowledge. Abstract Curricular theory must evolve to keep pace with the implications of the design, use, and effects of deploying and adapting digital curricular resources, especially when placed within digital learning systems (DLS) with rapid feedback and analytic capacity. We introduce an \"agile curriculum\" framework describing how to use classroom assessment data to regulate teachers' practices of iteratively adapting curricula. Our DLS, called Math-Mapper 6–8, is introduced as an example with its diagnostic assessments of students' progress along learning trajectories. An exploratory video study of middle school teachers reviewing, interpreting, and acting on its data, both during instruction (short cycle feedback) and within professional learning communities (long cycle feedback) illustrates how an agile curriculum framework supports data-driven adjustments based on student learning.

        "ClassDojo is one of the world's most successful educational technologies, currently used by over 3 million teachers and 35 million children globally. It reinforces and enacts emerging governmental 'psycho-policies' around the measurement and modification of children's social and emotional learning in schools. This article focuses specifically on the ways ClassDojo facilitates psychological surveillance through gamification techniques, its links to new psychological concepts of 'character development,' 'growth mindsets' and 'personal qualities,' and its connections to the psychological techniques of Silicon Valley designers. Methodologically, the research mobilizes network analysis to trace the organizational, technical, governmental and scientific relations that are translated together and encoded in the ClassDojo app. Through its alignment with emerging education psycho-policy agendas around the measurement of non-cognitive learning, ClassDojo is a key technology of 'fast policy' that functions as a 'persuasive technology' of 'psychocompulsion' to reinforce and reward student behaviours that are aligned with governmental strategies around social-emotional learning.

        "Choosing a career is one of the most important decisions that youth has to take but many young people find this a hard issue to engage with. Current career counselling practice does not appear very compelling or motivating to young people. Professional games could provide a more engaging and motivating way of acquiring professional awareness and competence for career decision making and learning. We present the design and effects of playing a game that aims to increase career awareness and adaptabilities in youth (13-19 years). In a Randomized Controlled Trial, 93 high school students from Iceland and Romania were asked to carry out career-oriented activities, with half playing an interactive game and the other half performing a paper-and-pencil version of the same activities. The students were compared on career adaptability, career learning and career awareness scores before and after these interventions. Main results show that engaging players in these career-oriented activities has short term effects on outcome scores for career adaptabilities and for perceptions of career learning competences. Students who played the game report significantly faster growth on career adaptabilities that deal with “concern”, “control” and “confidence”. It can therefore be concluded that introducing game-based learning in career decision support for youth is a promising endeavour. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a developmental disorder with different levels of severity. Although the exact causes of ASD is not yet known, nor is there a medical cure for ASD to date, special facilities and schools have been established to help individuals coping better and becoming more independent. With the advancement in Virtual Reality (VR) technology, there has been a greater depth of development of technology-enhanced game-based learning for children with ASD. This paper will describe our effort on virtual pink dolphins to assist children with ASD in their learning, at the same time, to avoid the use of physical pink dolphins which is a species endangered. A study on the use of a low-cost VR enabled pink dolphins game for children with ASD to learn direction following, psychomotor skills and hand-eye coordination will be reported.

        "This study sought to understand generational and role differences in web usage of teachers, teacher candidates and K-12 students in a state in the USA ( n = 2261). The researchers employed unique methods, which included using a custom-built persistent web browser to track user behaviours free of self-report, self-selection and perception bias. Results revealed that all three groups utilized a variety of resources daily, but with some noticeable differences. For instance, (1) teachers and teacher candidates used the Internet on school devices much more than students; (2) they accessed general, multimedia, search, entertainment, shopping and social resources at a higher rate than students; (3) students visited a higher proportion of educational websites than their teachers; and (4) teachers visited a higher proportion of search pages than teacher candidates. Results may be useful for researchers (1) to better understand generational differences between groups; (2) to expand educational technology research to better include non-pedagogical support tools for educators; and (3) to serve as a counterpoint for self-report data on web resource frequency of use, which may provide different results.

        "Digital media and digital data processing have substantially influenced public institutions in recent years and changed their efficiency, effectiveness and organisational set-up (nature of organisations). Based on Fountain's Technology Enactment Framework (TEF), this paper argues that, firstly, in a circular process, digital requirements transform the bureaucratic features of school organisation, and that the effects of digital technologies on the performance and efficiency of schools as bureaucratic organisations are ambivalent. We use interview data from a sample of 51% of the head teachers of vocational school centres in the jurisdiction of Bavaria in order to substantiate these assumptions by means of structured qualitative analysis. Email technology seems particularly significant from a quantitative perspective. Indications for the transformative nature of objective digital technologies with regard to the school bureaucracies can be found for all bureaucratic categories under consideration in this analysis, particularly for the feature 'standardisation'. The examples presented here seem to highlight that gains in efficiency or reductions of losses in efficiency caused by digitalisation are mostly caused by the concrete use of digital technology within the respective school organisation.

        "Sweden has easy access to digital technology, and the majority of the country's teachers have good digital skills. Despite this, in comparison with teachers in other European countries, there are few teachers who integrate digital tools on a daily basis into their teaching. It is not uncommon for computers and word‐processing programmes in the realm of schooling to be regarded as compensatory aids for pupils who need special support. For written examinations, usually the only implements permitted are pencil and paper, and at most schools to use the computer requires special certification. The present study has investigated future teachers' attitudes toward digital tools and their willingness to allow pupils to use these to help them read and produce texts. How do student‐teachers regard digital artifacts? Do they see these as compensatory aids or daily, legitimate tools? Are there any significant differences in their views depending on the type of teacher education programme or how far the student has advanced in his or her education? To investigate these questions, an online survey was conducted in which 247 students from five different teacher education programmes participated. The results show that future teachers' acceptance of digital tools is varied. Roughly, one can divide the respondents into three groups, where the first group, making up more than a third, has clearly a positive attitude toward the use of digital tools in instruction. The second group, which makes up a smaller proportion, has an ambivalent stance towards the use of digital tools and expresses uncertainty in questions regarding their use in instruction and during examinations. The third group is much more reserved about ICT‐use in school and in several cases openly negative. Based on these results, it is critical to discuss how the different types of teachers can ensure equivalence in the school mission. If teacher education wants to work towards encouraging and legitimizing the use of digital resources, there must be a clear effort made in their education and application. That knowledge and skills open up for change is one of the most important results shown in this study. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "In this study, an integrated gaming and multistage guiding approach was proposed for conducting in-field mobile learning activities. A mobile learning system was developed based on the proposed approach. To investigate the interaction between the gaming and guiding strategies on students' learning performance and motivation, a 2 × 2 experiment was conducted on an elementary school natural science course. Four groups of students were situated in a field trip to learn with different mobile learning approaches (ie, gaming or nongaming) and guiding mechanisms (ie, multistage or single-stage). The experimental results showed that both the gaming and multistage guiding mechanisms proposed in this study significantly enhanced the students' learning achievements. Moreover, the interaction between the two showed that the lead-in of the gaming strategy could significantly improve the learning motivation of the students who learned with the multistage guiding mechanism; on the contrary, their learning motivation could be significantly decreased without the gaming approach, although the multistage guiding mechanism was effective. The findings imply that 'gamification' could be a good approach for helping students accept learning support or tools provided in mobile learning scenarios. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "The addition of computing to England's National Curriculum was welcomed as a much‐needed modernization of the country's digital skills curriculum, replacing a poorly regarded ICT program of study with an industry‐supported scheme of computer science, robotics and computational thinking. This paper will demonstrate how teachers have acted as gatekeepers to block a curriculum that they view as narrow, difficult to teach and in conflict with their beliefs and practices as educational professionals. Extensive qualitative data were collected through classroom observations, teacher and student interviews and student artifact creation in four state‐maintained primary school classrooms to explore how teachers acted agentically to minimize or altogether reject a legally mandated curriculum that clashed with their local, professional knowledge. Analysis of this data was supported by official documents and personal accounts of the creation of the computing program of study, which highlight a discourse of economic anxiety and post‐imperialist nostalgia on the part of the curriculum's designers. This study will illuminate the significant influence that teachers wield as gatekeepers for subject content, with the ability to reject digital technology curricula even when it is supported by industry and mandated by law.

While the case study analysis identifies structures already reported in those earlier papers, it also draws attention to the prevalence of a Predict-and-test format in tasks carried out by students at the computer. This study also shows how synthesising the activity structure and instrumental orchestration frameworks may be productive. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "Digital textbooks that offer multimedia features, interactive controls, e-annotation and learning process tracking are gaining increasing attention in today's mobile learning era, particularly with the rapid development of mobile learning terminals such as Apple's iPad series and Android-based models. Accordingly, this study explores how elementary school students use digital textbooks via mobile learning terminals such as the iPad by mainly assessing relevant data resources. The participants of this study included 6211 students from 74 elementary schools in China. Several themes, such as demographic characteristics, self-efficacy, technology acceptance model, learning process, behavior attention and attitude with regard to their usage of digital textbooks, were analyzed. The data of this study would aid policy makers and educators in conducting further research on the implementation of the K-12 educational technology reform with digital textbooks via mobile learning terminals in formal school settings.

        "This study aimed to explore whether integrating augmented reality (AR) techniques could support a software editing course and to examine the different learning effects for students using online-based and AR-based blended learning strategies. The researcher adopted a comparative research approach with a total of 103 college students participating in the study. The experimental group (E.G.) learned with the AR-based contents, while the control group (C.G.) learned with the online-based support. The findings demonstrated the potential of AR techniques for supporting students' learning motivation and peer learning interaction, and the AR-based contents could be used as scaffolding to better support blended learning strategies. The AR-based learning interaction could also be a trigger arousing learners' interest in becoming active learners and the students presented great learning involvement after the AR-based supports were removed, while the learners in the C.G. were passive once the supports had been removed. Moreover, it was found that (1) their lack of experience with AR interaction and applications, (2) the slow speed of the Internet in the school, (3) the affordances of each learner's mobile learning devices, (4) the screen size of the learning interface and (5) the overloading of the learning information from the AR contents and teacher lectures might be the reasons why the learners were still more used to the online-based support. It was therefore concluded that when integrating AR applications into a course, technology educational researchers should take into careful consideration the target learning content design, the amount of information displayed on the mobile screen and the affordances of the learning equipment and classroom environment so as to achieve a suitable learning scenario.

        "The teaching of primary school mathematics is greatly oriented towards the development of basic mathematical literacy and cognitive skills such as remembering, understanding and applying (according to Bloom's revised taxonomy). Nowadays, it is very important to implement teaching methods that are motivating for children and lead to more effective teaching and learning. The use of digital technology such as interactive boards, tablets and smartphones with suitable software and applications is appropriate for children in this digital age. This contribution intends to point out the possibilities of GeoGebra software as an effective tool for teaching mathematics for children between 9 and 11 years of age. We created and circulated a questionnaire to determine the use of technology by primary education teachers in Slovakia and Hungary, and their opinions and experience concerning GeoGebra software. We will also show the results of the qualitative research through which we studied the possibilities of teaching geometry by using GeoGebra. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "If learning materials are presented in either a conversational or formal language style, people will process them differently. This study reports an experiment in which 64 high school students watched an educational video in a massive open online course scenario in which the instructions were phrased either conversationally or formally. The video demonstrated and explained the psychological McGurk effect. After watching the video, participants performed a transfer task. Learning outcomes were assessed and answers were analysed by using Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count. Results showed better learning outcomes for participants in the conversational (vs. formal) condition. Participants in the formal (vs. conversational) condition referred more to others in their answers. Implications for the design of massive open online courses are discussed. Lay Description: What is currently known about the subject matter: Language styles can affect individual dealing with learning materials.Addressing learners directly in the learning material can support transfer performance.Massive open online courses (MOOCs) have become the most prominent form of online learning in higher education.High school students (future students) are a new group of MOOC users. What this paper adds: MOOCs contain a social dimension, which might be crucial for individual learning.Most MOOCs do not ask for transferring knowledge of just learned materials.Conversational language in the instruction led to better transfer performance and more self‐directedness.Instructional language styles affect individual dealing with learning materials in a MOOC scenario. Implications of study findings for practitioners: MOOCs should apply conversational language style instructions for deeper learning.Conversational language style instructions and transfer tasks are easy to implement in already existing MOOCs.Being personally addressed in a MOOC might be a key for enhancing learners' involvement.

        "The current debate about student privacy issues raised by education technology focuses on how schools information with private vendors. It neglects a related but different trend, namely, the rise of online learning platforms offering learning experiences and credentials directly to users. These Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) and Virtual Education providers seek to 'disrupt' the traditional schooling system and position themselves as the next evolution in education. With privacy as the lens, this article highlights problematic dimensions of virtual learning platforms, which fashion themselves as education providers while shaking off the normative and regulatory constraints of traditional educational institutions. Structuring our evaluation around the theory of contextual integrity, we argue that by adopting commercial marketplace norms, these providers undermine core functions and values of education, which include promoting democracy, equal access to opportunity, and self-actualization as well as economic growth. Traditionally, the physical, normative, and regulatory constraints on school information practices created relatively hermetic learning environments. In contrast, Virtual Learning Environments automate instruction, maximize data collection, and codify learning outcomes according to the limited parameters of data-defined metrics and credentials. Because they collect information directly from learners without school mediation, independent Virtual Learning Environment providers fall outside the scope of student privacy regulation and can share information broadly without learner consent or consideration of educational purpose. Our concern is that the new practices risk chilling expression; encouraging narrow viewpoints and filtering out intellectual exploration; exacerbate existing inequities by raising stakes and retaining longitudinal records; and reduce learning to a purely instrumental exercise focused on economic outputs and quantifiable outcomes. MOOCs and Virtual Education providers must go beyond compliance with data collection and use regulation to preserve the values supported by student privacy norms. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "Despite rapid growth in online learning in social work and a growing body of research showing comparable levels of effectiveness and student satisfaction, concerns about online social work education remain among faculty. This is important given that faculty acceptance can play a pivotal role in the success and failure of online education. The current study aimed to compare levels of perceived effectiveness of online and on-the-ground education across nine social work competencies, as well as examine the association between experience with online education and perceived effectiveness of online education. The sample included 376 faculty recruited from schools of social work in the United States. Results suggest that online education is consistently perceived as being less effective than on-the ground education in helping students to meet Council on Social Work Education competencies. Furthermore, perceptions of effectiveness of online education are lowest for practice-oriented competencies. Regression analyses showed that tenure status, years of full-time teaching, technological preparedness, and level of exposure to online education were significantly associated with perceived effectiveness of online education. It is critical that schools develop more opportunities for faculty to engage in direct teaching experience online as well as enhance their levels of comfort and proficiency with technology.

        "This Forum explores what the Association of Theological Schools (ATS) has been learning about formation in online contexts through the Educational Models and Practices project. Deborah Gin's opening essay briefly enumerates operating assumptions, several widespread misconceptions, and emerging recommended practices. G. Brooke Lester proposes a definition of formation as transformation towards community, which is grounded in constructivist learning theory. He then reflects on the possibilities for this kind of community through online learning environments. Barbara Blodgett's contribution draws on \"transactional distance theory\" to analyze how a variety of pedagogical techniques (both online and face to face) can work to either exacerbate or minimize the distance between learners, which is an important contributor to formation and community. The Forum originated as panel presentations at the November 2017 Society of Biblical Literature and American Academy of Religion conferences. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "Mobile learning (mlearning) is an emerging trend in schools, utilizing mobile technologies that offer the greatest amount of flexibility in teaching and learning. Researchers have found that one of the main barriers to effective mlearning in schools is the lack of teacher professional development. Results from a needs-assessment survey and a post-workshop evaluation survey describe the professional development needs of teachers, technology coaches and administrators implementing an mlearning initiative in K–12 schools across 21 US states. Generally, needs shifted from a focus on technology integration and pedagogical coaching to a focus on the needs for ongoing support and time, reflecting a growing confidence in teachers to develop and implement mlearning lessons. Additionally, results from the needs assessment indicated that teachers and staff feel less confident about external areas such as support policies and community involvement – these areas may also offer areas for future growth in mlearning professional development.

        "According to general relativity (GR), we live in a four-dimensional curved universe. Since the human mind cannot visualize those four dimensions, a popular analogy compares the universe to a two-dimensional rubber sheet distorted by massive objects. This analogy is often used when teaching GR to upper secondary and undergraduate physics students. However, physicists and physics educators criticize the analogy for being inaccurate and for introducing conceptual conflicts. Addressing these criticisms, we analyze the rubber sheet analogy through systematic metaphor analysis of textbooks and research literature, and present an empirical analysis of upper secondary school students’ use and understanding of the analogy. Taking a theoretical perspective of embodied cognition allows us to account for the relationship between the experiential and sensory aspects of the metaphor in relation to the abstract nature of spacetime. We employ methods of metaphor and thematic analysis to study written accounts of small groups of 97 students (18-19 years old) who worked with a collaborative online learning environment as part of their regular physics lessons in five classes in Norway. Students generated conceptual metaphors found in the literature as well as novel ones that led to different conceptions of gravity than those held by experts in the field. Even though most students showed awareness of some limitations of the analogy, we observed a conflict between students’ embodied understanding of gravity and the abstract description of GR. This conflict might add to the common perception of GR being counterintuitive. In making explicit strengths and weaknesses of the rubber sheet analogy and learners’ conceptual difficulties, our results offer guidance for teaching GR. More generally, these findings contribute to the epistemological implications of employing specific scientific metaphors in classrooms. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "The main objective of the research was to analyse the study attitudes and study behaviour of online students at DOBA Business School. Furthermore, the aim was to evaluate the interrelationship between study attitudes and study behaviour and to assess the predictive value of the two sets of variables for students’ general satisfaction with the study programmes. A total of 331 students participated in the web survey. Participants expressed the most positive attitudes towards the use of technology and flexibility of online learning, while the absence of personal contacts was also perceived as highly favourable. Average scores for both deep and strategic approaches were quite high, while the surface approach was much less prominent. Participants were highly engaged with their teamwork assignments, whereas proactive communication was somewhat less developed. Study attitudes seem to be far more powerful predictors of general satisfaction than study behaviour, which is not surprising. Satisfaction is thought to be the result of the complex subjective evaluation of all relevant aspects of the study programme implementation, as they were measured by attitudinal subscales.

        "As online programmes in higher education continue to grow in number, the literature identifies emerging areas of concern. Whilst appreciating the flexibility and accessibility of online learning, learners often experience challenges in balancing their professional and personal lives whilst studying. In addition, such students have complained that their online educational experiences may be irrelevant and inappropriate, with tutors having limited presence or interest. Online learners' experiences are contingent upon the skills and characteristics of the tutors, who face the challenges of changing and developing practices, such as taking a more student-centred approach in order to provide opportunities that foster deep learning. Current, familiar practices may no longer be appropriate. There is a need to support tutors as they develop and expand their practices, facilitating familiarity and confidence with the opportunities afforded by a range of technologies. Research indicates that communities of practice as a form of staff development may assist tutors in this transition. This paper shares the early experiences of a recently formed Network for online tutors at Queen Margaret University, Edinburgh, Scotland. This community of practice was based upon an adapted Community of Inquiry Framework (Peacock & Cowan, 2016). The Network, endorsed by management, was launched in 2017, with two co-leads, one from an educational development unit and one from the School of Health Science. Sub groups, all led by members of the Network, were subsequently developed to look at specific aspects of online delivery and development within the University. The purpose of the Network and the successes achieved in the first academic year are outlined. The challenges arising in the early stages of implementing the Network are reported, and proposals for progress in the next academic year are discussed. Finally, suggestions are offered to those embarking on a similar endeavour. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "This study aims to show how the COVID-19 pandemic has affected the online learning process at Jordanian universities from a gender-based perspective. In Jordan, the government has taken various measures to contain the spread of the pandemic in the country by locking down schools and higher education institutions and replacing face-to-face lectures with online learning. To this end, a questionnaire was developed and distributed to students from Jordanian universities to evaluate whether family support, technology use, and stress and depression during online learning are influenced by gender differences. The findings reveal that gender disparities were present and significant. Utilizing the gender structure theory and the intersectional theory as incorporated with branches of feminist theories, the study underscores reasons that are conducive to the persistence of gender disparities mostly in favor of men at Jordanian universities. In the process, we recommend culturally specific remedial approaches that have the potential to reduce this gender gap. • The subordinate view of women continues in Jordan despite modest local effort toward mainstreaming gender equality. • The COVID-19 pandemic has widened the gender gap in online learning in favor of men. The pandemic worsened the existing fragility and gender inequality. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "The twenty-first century has seen unprecedented investment from governments around the world in educational technologies in schools. This paper investigates Australian teachers’ adoption and use of a popular technology that has been extensively supported by governments and school systems: the interactive whiteboard (IWB). The study suggests that a number of the barriers identified in the early days of adoption and use of this technology, such as professional support and access, still remain for many teachers, thereby impeding effective practices. The research also found that primary school teachers were using the technology in diverse ways, in contrast to secondary teachers who were using the IWB mainly for instructionist, presentational purposes. We conclude by considering various ways of reducing the effect of the identified barriers to support implementation of educational technologies in the classroom, especially the next generation of technologies promoted by governments and systems.

        "The growth of Smartphone usage, increased acceptance of electronic learning (E-learning), the availability of high reliability mobile networks and need for flexibility in learning have resulted in the growth of mobile learning (M-learning). This has led to a tremendous interest in the acceptance behaviors related to M-learning users among the information systems researchers. Despite a large amount of significant research in the field of M-learning, the measurement of user acceptance of M-learning has not received attention. This research study intends to develop and validate a survey that measures users’ acceptance of M-learning. A total sample of 806 university and higher college students from different institutes in Oman participated in this study. This research study was conducted in two stages. The first stage using a sample size of 388 students initiated a generic questionnaire, and examined factorial validity and reliability. The second stage that was conducted using different sample of 418 students employed confirmatory factor analysis to establish factorial validity and measurement invariance. A correlated six-factor model (Flexibility, Suitability, Enjoyment, Efficiency, Economic and Social) was fit using maximum likelihood estimation. The internal consistency and item reliability of Mobile Learning Acceptance Measure was found to be at acceptable level for both samples. [ABSTRACT FROM PUBLISHER]",

        "Participants in educational technology research regularly share personal data which carries with it risks. Informing participants of these data sharing risks is often only done so through text contained within a consent form. However, conceptualizations of data sharing risks and knowledge of responsible data management practices among teachers and learners may be impoverished—limiting the effectiveness of a consent form in communicating such risks in a manner that adequately supports participants in making informed decisions about sharing their data. At two high schools participating in an educational research project involving the use of technology in the classroom, we investigate teacher and student conceptions of data sharing risks and knowledge of responsible data management practices; and introduce a communication approach that attempts to better inform educational technology research participants of such risks. Results of this study suggest that most teachers have not received formal training related to responsibly managing data; and both teachers and students see the need for such training as they come to realize that their understanding of responsible data management is underdeveloped. Thus, efforts beyond solely explaining data sharing risks in an informed consent form may be needed in educational technology research to facilitate ethical self‐determination.

        "After the Sputnik shock of 1957, the United States initiated education reform, based in part on the hope that technology could facilitate efficient school learning. This development was largely driven by the confrontation between the eastern and western Blocs: on both sides of the Iron Curtain, reformists promoted educational technology for the purpose of better instruction so as to improve the performance capacity of their own societies. The first section of the article focuses on this circulation of knowledge, after which the second section, drawing on the example of Germany, argues that, due to the constellation of interests in the 1960s, substantial organisational and financial resources could be mobilised to promote educational technology. However, when support from political and pedagogical circles dwindled in the 1970s, it became detached from its previous objectives, but was pragmatically advanced in the private sector.

        "There is a clamour of voices around the contemporary issue of tablet computers in early years education. A growing body of research presents the potential of tablet computers to transform education, provide unprecedented learning opportunities and positive outcomes for young children and offer rich opportunities for independent learning and collaborative interaction. However, this is tempered with disquiet from a number of sources which posit that digital devices are diminishing children’s play and are an affront to childhood. Many of these polemic debates come from adult perspectives yet children are the key users in the dizzying advancement of technology and their views are a crucial element in understanding the conceptualisation of tablet devices as pedagogical tools. This paper takes a children’s rights approach in acknowledging that children have the right to have their voices heard and their experiences understood. Therefore, this paper seeks to add further insights to the debates on digital technology in early years education by presenting the views of one of the central players within this debate - young children.

        "This paper critically examines the ways in which ClassDojo is altering the disciplinary landscape in schools through the datafication of discipline and student behaviour. ClassDojo is one of the most popular and successful educational technologies and is used internationally. It is a school-based social media platform that incorporates a gamified behaviour-shaping function, providing school communities with a centralised digital network in which to interact. We argue that ClassDojo's datafying system of school discipline intensifies and normalises the surveillance of students. Furthermore, it creates a culture of performativity and serves as a mechanism for behaviour control. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "Much attention has focused on technology acceptance in the classroom, with little investigation into how parents make decisions about their children’s use of portable technology to support reading development in the home. Applying the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology, this study identifies predictors of parents portable technology adoption intentions to support children’s reading development in the home. Participants were parents from two elementary schools within 46 classrooms in the southeastern United States. Phase one of data collection included 120 parents who responded to a validated survey that identified predictors and behavioral intention to adopt technology. The regression model explained 64% of parents have intentions to use portable technology to develop their children’s reading skills, with social influence and attitude as the most important predictors. Surveys indicated 99% of children used portable technology to support reading in the home, therefore phase two included explanatory interviews to examine adoption predictors. Interview data specified social influence ensued from the child’s school and parent community; attitude resulted from children’s affinity to use technology. Though parents’ intentions indicated continued portable technology use, parents preferred their child read print books. Interview data also revealed parents perceived an increase in performance expectancy when their child used portable technology. This study highlights the need for teachers and school administrators to be cognizant of educational requests on home learning, influences of the broader parent community on parent intentions to adopt educational technology, and children’s enjoyment reading with portable technology.

        "Advances in learning approaches can enhance deeper levels of mathematical thinking and engagement through the use of new digital environments and technologies. The growing utilisation of portable digital devices in schools has meant there are enhanced tools to support mathematical learning and understandings. This article focused on those who work together to provide learning approaches in mathematics for 11- to 13-year-old students in New Zealand primary schools. The research study involved six schools, chosen to reflect a variety of school types and populations. We interviewed six principals and eight teachers about aspects of eLearning in their school mathematics programmes. The study found that the cost of some programmes and the lack of Internet connections and lack of computers in poorer homes did not allow for a level digital playing field for all children. Teachers considered eLearning as an opportunity to practice skills in a high interest and varietal way. However, in some cases, the teachers had little confidence to use information and communications technology (ICT) effectively. Only one school provided ongoing professional development on ICT use for mathematics learning. Even though many of the classrooms were well resourced, the teachers did not appear to have knowledge of learning approaches which encourage higher-order thinking skills to raise mathematics achievement.

        "The purpose of this mixed‐methods study was to explore special education teachers’ attitudes towards using technology in inclusive classrooms in Oman. The sample consisted of 428 special education teachers working in Omani public schools (250 teachers of students with learning disabilities (LD), 90 teachers of students with intellectual disability and 88 teachers of students with hearing impairment). Participants responded to the attitudes towards computers questionnaire. For the qualitative section of this study, three semi‐structured group interviews were conducted with a group of special education teachers: 15 teachers of students with hearing impairment, 15 teachers of students with intellectual disabilities and 15 teachers of students with LD). Also, the teachers responded to a survey of educational technology which encompassed seven questions about computer technology. Results of the study indicated that the special education teachers’ attitudes towards using computers were generally positive. The most notable positive attitudes were in the following subscales: special education considerations, staff development considerations, computers use in society, and computers and quality of instruction issues. The analysis of variance results showed that experience and type of disability did not have a significant effect on teachers’ attitudes towards technology. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "In eLearning context searching for suitable educational material is still a challenging issue. During the last two decades, various digital repositories, such as Learning Object Repositories, institutional repositories and latterly Open Educational Resources, have been developed to accommodate collections of learning material that can be used for instructive and research purposes. In order to make this learning material publicly available through internet searching mechanisms, it has to be enriched with metadata. Nowadays, emerging Web 3.0 applications necessitate further enhancing learning resources with semantic knowledge to facilitate conceptually searching. Adding semantic value to educational resources could be achieved by modeling ontologically the metadata profile which describes them. The purpose of this work is to demonstrate the process of enhancing semantically learning resources by developing a new ontology and a prototype system to accommodate them. The designed ontology is originated from a metadata profile which is build according to the guidelines posed by Singapore Framework for Dublin Core Application Profiles. We focus on educational material for teaching courses on Informatics in primary and secondary education in Greece but the methodology and mechanism introduced could be easily adapted in any domain-specific setting.

        "It is highly important for the higher educational institutions to understand the factors that affect the students' acceptance of Mobile Learning (M-learning) systems as a prior step to the implementation of such systems. From the M-learning perspective, the literature ignores some factors that could contribute to improve the knowledge acquisition, sharing, application, and protection, and how such factors could affect the M-learning acceptance. From the Knowledge Management (KM) perspective, research shows that KM processes have a positive impact on the acceptance and implementation of many Information Systems (IS). We observed that the existing literature overlooks the impact of KM processes on M-leaming acceptance. Accordingly, the main objective of this study is to analyse the students' perceptions towards the integration of KM processes in M-learning systems. A mixed method (questionnaire and interviews) was used for data collection. An online survey has been sent to IT undergraduate students in two different universities in two different regions namely, Universiti Malaysia Pahang (UMP) in Malaysia and A1 Buraimi University College (BUC) in Oman. 305 students responded to the survey. Results indicated that around 74% of students reported that it is interesting to incorporate KM processes in M-leaming systems. Additionally, results pointed out that 93% of the students indicated that they would use the M-learning system in their studies if all KM processes will be taken into consideration. It is imperative that these results will assist the M-learning systems developers to take these factors into their consideration while designing and developing such systems. Furthermore, educators may need to elaborate their teaching strategies in a way that suits the use of these systems and meets the students' needs. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "Typical applications of gamification in education use either game mechanics to encourage positive engagement behaviors or full games to deliver educational content; however, both approaches raise some concerns. Game mechanics can distract from the intrinsic enjoyment of activities while full games construct learning contexts that may be significantly different from the real-world contexts of the targeted subject matter. This paper aims to highlight issues of behavioral conditioning and knowledge transfer in instructional design th a t uses gamification by examining foundational theories and recent studies. Wc propose a design approach called \"gameful learning\" that focuses on integrating intrinsically rewarding, playful aspects of game-like experiences into authentic learning activities. Authentic learning activities relate real-world contexts to classroom learning while the desired motivational outcomes of playful experiences are shown to be more fulfilling than extrinsic rewards. We then investigate playful experiences in a game-based learning activity integrated into a business English class at a Japanese technical college. In the activity, mixed teams of Japanese and Singaporean students (N = 47) competed at negotiating for resources required to establish businesses within the specified time limits. The results of our analysis show the experiences of arousal, contest, and discovery were the most prevalent in the game. Levels of arousal and thrill showed the strongest positive correlations to enjoyment, implying the students had approached the activity with a playful attitude rather than a serious one. The Japanese students' reported levels of engagement in the contest and experiences of achievement correlated strongly with their sense of challenge. These results and their implications for the development of a playful affordances model as a tool for the design of gamification and gamebased learning activities are the focus of this paper.

        "Historically implementing, maintaining and managing educational technology has been difficult for K-12 educational systems. Consequently, opportunities for significant advances in K-12 education have often gone unrealized. With the maturation of Internet delivered services along with K-12 institutional trends, educational technologies are poised to help support the transformation K-12 education by providing student access to educational resources on an anywhere, anytime, any device basis. In addition, an emerging body of empirical research shows that when implemented systematically, technology can support a wide range of potential education innovations including inverted classrooms, peer-to-peer teaching and customized learning as well as increased academic achievement. A major public policy question is how best to insure educational technology resources reach all K-12 students in the shortest time and most equitable way possible. In response, this paper adopted an educational technology value chain model to assess potential avenues and barriers to implementing educational technology inK-12 systems. We find that a fully implemented educational technology value chain would directly benefit students, teachers, school systems and society. However, the analysis also finds that efforts to implement educational technology in K-12 systems still must overcome challenges and risks. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "An article inThe Atlantic‘Quantifying the Ed-Tech Market’ (2015), which draws on a review by the Education Technology Industry Network, reports that the U.S. Ed-tech market totalled $8.38 billion in the 2012–2013 academic year, which is up from $7.9 billion the year before, and up 11.7 per cent from 2009. K-12 online course revenue including any digital curriculum increased some 320% and the testing and assessment market, the largest single category, generated $2.5 billion. The New Zealand business organisation EDTechNZ, indicates on its website that educational technology is the fastest growing sector of a global smart education market worth US$100 billion, forecast to grow to US$394 by 2019. The same source indicates that Cloud-based educational technology is accelerating at 20% growth per annum and is forecast to reach US$12 billion by 2019. These returns are unequalled by most other economic sectors. Our concern in this article is that the market imperative based on selling has become a driving logic for digital technologies in schools while learning gets lost in the rush for companies to profit from schools, creating de facto privatisation by stealth. Aspects of the New Zealand educational context are used to illustrate our thinking, especially since most educational provision is still state owned and taxpayer funded. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "The purpose of this research is to investigate pre-university science Collège d'enseignement général et professionnel (CEGEP) students' behavioral intentions towards using online learning technologies. Heretofore, CEGEP students' use of technology has received scant attention, yet online learning technologies are found to play an increasingly important role in CEGEP classrooms today. The present study seeks to address this by examining CEGEP students' use of online learning technologies. Our main research question was: What factors affect CEGEP students' intentions to use online learning technologies? A total of 213 CEGEP students were surveyed, the resulting data was analyzed using the technology acceptance model (TAM; Davis MIS Quarterly, 13(3), 319, 1989). The findings of this research provide guidance for future implementations of online learning technologies in the CEGEP education system. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "Mobile App technology in social work education remains in the embryonic stages of development with a few notable exceptions. The use of Apps in College and University settings has been reported in other sectors of higher education, although there is a paucity of research in relation to its relevance to social work education and practice. The following article describes the creation of four social work education and practice Apps by a team of social work educators. The primary focus is on the design process and the partnership approach to the creation of the tools. It also outlines the rationale for the App development, the working process and the theoretical framework underpinning mobile learning.

        "Abstract: We uncovered two critical issues in earlier studies: (a) some studies have shown that mobile learning technology is not beneficial for all students due to complexity of learning environments and student prior knowledge, skills, and experience and (b) familiarity of students with the authentic environments in which they learn using mobile technology did not receive much attention in earlier studies. To address these issues, we designed three learning tasks for a class of 26 junior high school students. The students applied language skills by completing the tasks in authentic environments individually in a first task, loosely collaborating with peers in a second task, and tightly collaborating with peers in a third task. A mobile learning system was also designed in this study to support students to accomplish the tasks. The aim of this study was to explore students' learning experiences using the learning system, their perceptions towards the system, and to assess how differently the students perform on the three tasks. According to our design, in the first task, the students took pictures of objects and described them orally or in writing using the mobile learning system. In the second task, after the students completed assignments, each student received comments from a partner through the system. In comments, the partner indicated flaws in student assignments and suggested how to fix them. In the third task, the students completed assignments, shared them using the system, and then exchanged comments with their partners face to face regarding issues related to their completed assignments and suggested how to improve them. Such learning behaviours in the three tasks enabled the students to practise writing and speaking skills. Our results demonstrate that most of the students highly valued our learning system and intend to use it in the future. Furthermore, the results show that the students performed best when they collaborated; namely, student performance was enhanced the most after the third task that required tight collaboration. Based on our results, we learned that students' familiarity with authentic environments is very important and beneficial for their learning. In addition, we learned that even in complex environment, less skilled and experienced students with low prior knowledge can perform well when they tightly collaborate with more skilled and experienced students with high prior knowledge, and our learning system can facilitate such collaboration.

        "This case study, noting the increasing interest in iPad-based mobile learning research and aware of the current dearth of engineering talent in the UK, aims to contribute to a still sparse area of research that links iPad use to engineering education. To achieve this, the study investigates the integration of iPad-based mobile learning (M-learning) into a creative engineering (CE) module in a secondary school in England that has adopted a problem-based learning pedagogy. The findings indicate that iPad-based M-learning is compatible with the problem-based learning pedagogy underpinning the particular creative engineering module, both philosophically and practically, inside and outside the classroom. The integration of the iPad with problem-based CE pedagogy is able therefore to create a new M-learning pedagogical model. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "The research examines further education (FE) students’ engagement with virtual learning environments (VLEs) and, in particular, the barriers that may affect the students’ access and use of Moodle. To date, existing research related to VLEs has been conducted primarily within higher education (HE) contexts. In contrast, this study explores the views of both students and teachers in an FE college in England and aims to provide insights into the factors which impact FE learners’ participation in online learning through a VLE. The outcomes of this study indicate that the course design, which is understood as a process, had the most significant effect on the students’ engagement with the VLE, and specifically: (1) its pedagogical focus, (2) the VLE programmes’ accessibility characteristics, and (3) the consideration for students’ individual needs, circumstances and expectations. To address the identified issues, recommendations are provided for teacher training and a strategic approach towards the VLE use. The findings and the associated suggestions may be of value to a wide FE context. [ABSTRACT FROM PUBLISHER]",

        "Abstract: Anxiety plays an influential role in foreign language learning. However, a lack of attention was paid to examining the effects of anxiety levels on learning performance and gaming performance in digital game‐based learning. To this end, this study developed a game‐based English learning system and investigated how different levels of anxiety affected learners' learning performance and gaming performance. A quasi‐experiment was conducted in an elementary school. The results showed that high‐anxiety learners performed worse than low‐anxiety learners in speaking, word/sentence match, and overall learning performance. However, they performed similarly in listening performance. Moreover, the results showed that high‐ and low‐anxiety learners demonstrated a similar level of gaming performance. A subsequent analysis showed that significant correlations existed between learning performance and gaming performance for learners with high anxiety whereas such positive correlations were rarely found for learners with low anxiety, indicating that high‐anxiety learners' learning performance could be fostered by their gaming performance. The findings suggested that digital game‐based learning was particularly beneficial to high‐anxiety learners, whose gaming performance was a facilitative factor of their learning performance.

        "In traditional teacher-centered mathematics instruction, students might show low learning motivation owing to the lack of applied contexts. Game-based learning has been recognized as a potential approach to addressing this issue; however, without proper alignment between the gaming and math-applied contexts, the benefits of game-based learning could be limited. Therefore, this study aims to develop a microworldbased educational game, which provides simulated contexts encouraging students to explore, discover, and solve practical problems using the mathematics knowledge gained in the class. A quasiexperimental design was implemented in the learning activity of the \"Speedy World\" unit in an elementary school mathematics course to examine the effectiveness of the proposed approach. A total of 107 sixth graders participated in the experiment. The experimental results showed that the students who learned with the microworld-based gaming approach had better learning achievement and motivation in the mathematics course than those who learned with the conventional technology-enhanced learning approach. In addition, the students also showed that they highly accepted the microworld-based game for learning mathematics. The findings of this study provide good evidence for the importance and necessity of associating authentic applied contexts with gaming contexts in developing computer educational games for mathematics.

        "Much application software education in Taiwan can hardly be regarded as practical. The researchers in this study provided a flexible means of ubiquitous learning (u-learning) with a mobile app for students to access the learning material. In addition, the authors also adopted computational thinking (CT) to help students develop practical computing skills. Three classes of first-year students were chosen for the empirical study. They were divided into three groups: two experimental groups (CT&UL group and CT group) and one control group. According to the results in this study, students who received the treatment of u-learning could have significantly better computing skills in using PowerPoint and Word than those without. However, the treatment of web-mediated CT did not result in better development of students’ computing skills in this research. Finally, the researchers expect that this study provides a design and illustration of CT in a u-learning environment for schools and educators. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "Adopting a differentiated and domain-specific view of educational technology, the present study focuses on the case of school history. It argues that, in this particular context, one of technology's main assets is its ability to support inquiry-based learning activities, during which students interpret the past through historical reasoning. As little is known about how history teachers use technology in the classroom, an exploratory study was carried out with 22 teachers in fourth grade of secondary education in Flanders (Belgium). Semi-structured interviews were used to investigate beliefs about technology, ways in which technology was implemented, and factors influencing the adoption process. The results suggest that most teachers held positive beliefs about technology, and that use of technology was driven by several rationales. Although a significant group of teachers was thoughtful of how their own use of technology could support students' learning, student use remained limited to instances where technology served as a resource for the task, rather than a tool for supporting cognitive or social activity. It appears that teachers were not yet aware of technology's ability to scaffold inquiry activities. Furthermore, limitations in school infrastructure often prevented them from experimenting with more pervasive student uses of technology. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "Education is in the process of transforming traditional print-based instruction into digital formats. This multi-case study sheds light on the challenge of coping with the old and new in literacy teaching in the context of technology-mediated instruction in the early years of schooling (7–8 years old children). By investigating the relation between literacy and digital technology in diverse pedagogical contexts we capture the complexity in the educational transformation that needs to be acknowledged. Each of the cases demonstrates a distinct knowledge focus and goal for early literacy instruction, organisation and access around technology and what is made visible in instruction. All these factors had consequences for the teaching that occurred. Depending on epistemological beliefs, digital competencies were taught separately from literacy and considered as a goal on its own or integrated with literacy considered as a means and a goal for literacy teaching and learning. Implicit pedagogy with weaker classification and framing enabled conditions for infused approaches making use of digital technology in multimodal, functional and learner centred literacy practices. Furthermore, initial guidance and the weaving of invisible and visible pedagogy highlight a possible way to both exploit the potential of digital technology and support children from various backgrounds. The balance of teacher and student control was further affected in regard to the organisation of technology and choices of pedagogical methods. This research hereby expands the current discussion on the relation between technology and literacy with an understanding that the epistemological focus and context of practices are necessary tools to problematize, rather than measure or value, emerging practices in early literacy instruction. We conclude that in addition to the necessary heavy investments in digital technology in schools there is a need to provide room for action for the teachers and address issues of purpose, pedagogy and organisation around technology.

        "Abstract: Mobile‐based micro‐learning has gained a lot of attention lately, especially for work‐based and corporate training. It combines features of mobile learning and micro‐learning to deliver small learning units and short‐term learning activities. The current study uses the lens of the Self‐Determination Theory of motivation and proposes a series of Mobile‐Based micro‐Learning and Assessment (MBmLA) homework activities to improve high school students' motivation and learning performance in science. An experiment was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. One hundred and eight students of a senior‐level high school in Europe were randomly assigned into either a control condition (conventional paper‐based homework approach) or an experimental (MBmLA approach) condition. The study carried out for a period of 5 weeks. From the experimental results, it was found that, in comparison to the conventional paper‐based approach, the proposed MBmLA approach enhanced students' basic psychological needs of self‐perceived autonomy, competence, and relatedness and improved students' exam performance in terms of factual knowledge. Moreover, students self‐reported greater learning satisfaction with the mobile‐based microassessment and micro‐learning homework tasks. Implications on educational practices as well as future research are discussed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "Contemporary education policy involves the integration of novel forms of data and the creation of new data platforms, in addition to the infusion of business principles into school governance networks, and intensification of socio-technical relations. In this paper, we examine how 'computational rationality' may be understood as intensifying of an instrumental set of logics in educational governance and decision making, and/or as opening up new explorations around the uncertainty and incompleteness of policy. We suggest that policy rationalities focused on prediction, transparency and data provide the conditions of possibility for Artificial Intelligence to be integrated into, and intensify aspects of, what we term 'computational education policy'.

        "Abstract: This study explored the effect of different classroom spatial layouts on student perceptions of digital technology in a secondary schooling environment. A quasi‐experimental approach facilitated by a Single Subject research design (SSRD) isolated the impact of two learning spaces—traditional' classrooms, and ‘new generation learning spaces’ (NGLS), on students' perceived effectiveness, use and value of one‐to‐one technology as a learning tool. Results from quantitative analyses over the period of a school year indicated that different spatial configurations had a measurable effect on how students' perceived the effectiveness of the affordances of digital technology, with improvements often linked to NGLS. However, the evidence suggests that a change in learning space alone will not increase learning. A change in space supports those teachers who are able and willing to integrate the affordances of technology into their practice. Building on the collective methodologies of earlier work this analysis has reinforced the credibility of this unique methodological approach, arguing this evaluative strategy offers the capacity to generate much needed robust empirical data on evaluation of learning environments in a secondary school setting.

        "The purpose of this study is to develop a multi-dimensional scale to measure students' awareness of key competencies for M-learning and to test its reliability and validity. The Key Competencies of Mobile Learning Scale (KCMLS) was determined via confirmatory factor analysis to have four dimensions: team collaboration, creative thinking, critical thinking and problem solving, and communication. The research subjects are 815 students from the elementary school that participate in M-learning programme in Taiwan. The research results show that students have better self-awareness in team collaboration and creative thinking, but have worse self-awareness in critical thinking and problem solving. This study also found that there was no significant difference between genders in the KCMLS, but students who study in the schools that committed in M-learning longer have higher awareness in all dimensions than students who study in the schools that committed to M-learning in fewer years.

        "Learning with mobiles in UK universities is not new and is not novel. It is, in fact, at least 10 years old, well-documented and comparable to activity in universities elsewhere in Western Europe, America and Asia Pacific. Continued and dramatic changes in the ownership, access and expectations of mobiles amongst university students and equally across UK society have suddenly propelled learning with mobiles to centre-stage as a feasible proposition but, it is now argued, only if students can bring-your-own-device. This has already catalysed discussion about authority, agency and control within university settings but the equally significant and profound implications for the inclusion agenda have not been articulated. This paper begins that process. A theoretical framework for social inclusion in this context is considered, identified and discussed. The paper reviews the progress and problems of the substantial and unique programme of mobile learning across UK higher education since 2000 in relation to its stance on inclusion, where this is apparent. These are all well-documented in academic and official sources; the paper does however also draw on the author's involvement in many of the events and initiatives. The paper raises however significant questions about this programme's meaning and direction in a world where now there is more, better, cheaper, faster, newer but different digital technology in the hands of students, potential students and everyone else than there is routinely in the educational institutions themselves. This digital technology, mobile technology, nowallows learners to create, own, transform, discuss, discard, share, store and broadcast ideas, opinions, images and information, and to create and transform identities and communities. The paper argues that this epistemological revolution may mean that universities and colleges are no longer credible and authoritative gatekeepers to knowledge and its technologies and so the meaning and relevance of inclusion are much less clear. The paper proposes a new stance on inclusion. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "This case study follows seven high school teachers over the course of a year engaging in “ Player Professional Development.” As these teachers studied game design principles for classroom instruction, this study looks at how their gameful learning intersected with administrative disruption of teacher time. Building on literature about communities of practice, teacher resiliency, and game-based learning, these findings highlight how structural barriers to teacher-led PD affect feelings of teacher burnout. Ultimately, the teachers in this study shifted from a stance of “playing” to “escaping” PD, reflecting a general attitudinal shift to structural PD challenges at their school site.

        "This study investigated electrical engineering faculty's perspectives towards technology integration in classrooms. A survey research method obtained professors' perceptions of technology integration. A questionnaire developed in the study consisted of four psychological constructs: development of digital learning material, digital learning technology use, school administrative support, and individual instructional perception (defined as personal barriers to technology adoption). One hundred twenty-eight electrical engineering faculty members in Taiwan participated in the study. The findings show that the overall electrical engineering professors' attitude towards technology integration in classrooms is positive. Faculty members perceive individual instructional perception, such as time investment and teaching burden, to be a major concern for integrating technologies into teaching and learning. Age and academic rank do not strongly influence their attitudes towards technology integration. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "Background:Knowledge construction and technology have been identified as critical for an understanding of the future of teacher education. Knowledge is discovered, applied and created collaboratively from authentic starting points. Today’s new mobile and blended learning environments create increased opportunities for such processes, including learner-centred approaches, authenticity and dialogical knowledge construction. However, teaching still requires appropriate learning design and structuring. The presented study explored, and was designed and implemented, using the ‘Dialogical Authentic Netlearning Activity’ (DIANA) pedagogical model, which is seen as one of the learning designing models for existing digital, open and mobile learning environments. Purpose:The purpose of this study was to identify the challenges and opportunities inherent in the adoption of the DIANA model and to examine student-teachers’ reflections concerning authentic and dialogical knowledge construction. The focus is on the learning process. Sample:Participants were 63 student-teachers who were following the study module ‘Networks in Vocational Education’ at the School of Professional Teacher Education, in Hämeenlinna, Finland. Design and methods:This qualitative study uses a deductive content analysis to discern relationships between the data and the existing theory. The data for this study were drawn from an online questionnaire and participants’ self-reflective accounts. Findings:The results indicate that achieving deep-oriented learning through dialogical actions is the most challenging part of using the DIANA model. Some of the students had difficulty understanding the concept of ‘authenticity’. Conclusions:The findings of this study suggest enhancing learner-centred scaffolding and guidance, particularly at the outset of the learning process. In addition, methods that develop dialogical skills and competences ought to be integrated into teacher education as extensively as possible, in order to make collaborative work and problem-solving genuinely dialogical and equal.

        "Abstract: We have observed that many computer‐supported writing environments based on pedagogical strategies have only been designed to incorporate the cognitive aspects, but motivational aspects should also be included. Hence, we theorize that integrating game‐based learning into the writing environment may be a practical approach that can facilitate student participation, not only helping students learn how to write, but also sustaining their willingness to write. In this study, we investigate the effects of the game‐based writing environment on improving students' participation, performance, and interest in writing. An experiment was conducted to compare the effectiveness of 2 approaches to writing in language arts at an elementary school. Two hundred forty‐five third grade students participated in the experiment over a period of 1 year. One hundred thirty‐nine students were assigned to an experimental group and learned with a game‐based writing environment, and 106 students were in the contrast group and learned with an online writing environment. The empirical results show that the game‐based writing environment can effectively promote students' writing participation, writing performance, interest in writing, as well as their perceptions of the use of educational self‐management games. Some implications of the experimental results are also discussed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of different modes of competition on science learning in a game-based learning (GBL) environment. Some key motivational constructs such as learning goals, performance goals, and perceived ability were also investigated. One hundred ninety-five students from a secondary school in Taiwan were randomly assigned to three conditions (anonymous competition, non-anonymous competition, and a control group) in a GBL environment to learn the concepts of force and balance. The results suggested that students in both the anonymous competition and non-anonymous competition groups outperformed students in the control groups. Additionally, we found that the students in the anonymous competition group reported higher learning goals and higher perceived ability than the control group did, whereas students in the non-anonymous competition group reported higher performance goals than the control group did. This study extends findings from previous research on the influences of GBL on learning and motivation. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "While there are several positive outcomes from implementing game design in a formal learning context, there are also challenges that have to be considered in order to improve game-based learning. This is explored in the article, using the concepts of activity frames and stancetaking, focusing on the social organization of the game design activity. Building on video data from one 6th grade class and one 7th grade class designing computer games based on their social studies curriculum, this article shows that tensions arise when students fail to agree on what the activity they are doing is really about: The academic content and what students commonly perceive as school activities, or a game design activity informed by their leisure time. The main argument is that the students position themselves as students, game designers or characters, and that this may cause tensions in the students' social interactions. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "This experimental study was intended to examine whether game-based learning (GBL) that encompasses four particular game characteristics (challenges, a storyline, immediate rewards and the integration of game-play with learning content) in an OpenSimulator-supported virtual reality learning environment can improve perceived motivational quality of the learning activity (P-MQLA) for elementary school students. In this pre- and post-test experimental comparison study, data were collected from 132 fourth-graders through a Short Instructional Materials Motivation Survey. The same tasks were provided for the experimental and control groups, except that the control group’s tasks did not include the four aforementioned gaming characteristics. The non-GBL for the control group involved mainly web-based word problems such as selecting the correct answer by clicking on the potential responses. P-MQLA was improved after the intervention in both groups. There is a trend that the experimental group improved the P-MQLA more than the control group, at borderline statistical significance. The analysis of covariance also indicated a significant interaction between the group variable and the pre-intervention P-MQLA, indicating that the effect of the virtual reality-supported GBL is moderated by learners’ pre-intervention report of P-MQLA.

        "In this study, a mission synchronization-based peer-assistance approach is proposed to improve students’ learning performance in digital game-based learning activities. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, an experiment has been conducted in an elementary school natural science course to examine the participants’ learning attitudes, collaboration skills, and learning achievements. From the experimental results, it was found that the educational game with the mission synchronization-based peer-assistance mechanism not only benefited the students in terms of promoting their learning achievements and attitudes, but also improved their collaboration skills via encouraging them to actively provide assistance to their peers during the gaming process. Finally, to further investigate the factors that might affect the performance of the mission synchronization-based peer-assistance approach, the students’ learning behaviors are summarized and discussed.

        "• Understanding the challenges of transition in the education of fiji. • Performance of first-year students and their entry-level challenges in a university. • The results mostly disseminate transitional educational challenges using the most critical drivers. • Transitional experience and an ability to make transitions. • Overcoming transitional challenges, language barriers, and cultural lacunas. Transition challenges (or Trans-C) are perceived as a combination of academic, institutional, socio-cultural and psychological factors which influence a student's ability to transition successfully in their first year at higher education institutions. This paper presents an exploratory study of first-year College of Business students enroled at the Fiji National University (FNU). Using a mixed method approach, the study is aimed at understanding the accounts of first-year students in transition, and that of FNU being a local academic institution mandated to support students facing difficulties. Quantitative data from an online questionnaire collected independent variables related to students' ability to transition successfully. Results showed that despite the establishment of transition hubs and other academic support services, about 30% of the total 183 respondents indicated transition difficulties in their first year. Qualitative data were collected using ' Talanoa ' method to account for students' transition experience. Talanoa or story telling is a culturally appropriate method of data collection in indigenous Pacific Island countries such as Fiji. This approach allows a rich and more open information exchange provided the researcher is embedded in local pedagogy. Several themes emerged from the analysis of the 'talanoa' transcripts such as academic support, family income, online learning, University environment, and peer influence. Although these themes were consistent with international experience, it would be asymmetrical to address student transition challenges without capturing their needs and expectations. In the final analysis, this paper supports the implementation of a student-centric model if higher education institutions (HEI) were to be successful in integrating first-year students into academic life.

        "<bold>Background</bold>: Recent research and curriculum reforms have indicated the need for diversifying teaching approaches by drawing upon student interest and engagement in ways which makes learning science meaningful. <bold>Purpose</bold>: This study examines the integration of informal/free choice learning which occurred during learning experiences outside school (LEOS) with classroom learning using digital technologies. Specifically, the digital technologies comprised a learning management system (LMS), <italic>Moodle</italic>, which fits well with students’ lived experiences and their digital world. <bold>Design and Method</bold>: This study examines three out-of-school visits to Informal Science Institutes (ISI) using a digitally integrated fieldtrip inventory (DIFI) Model. Research questions were analysed using thematic approach emerging along with semi-structured interviews, before, during and after the visit, and assessing students’ learning experiences. Data comprised photographs, field notes, and unobtrusive observations of the classroom, <italic>wiki</italic> postings, student work books and teacher planning diaries. <bold>Results</bold>: We argue, that pre- and post-visit planning using the DIFI Model is more likely to engage learners, and the use of a digital learning platform was even more likely to encourage collaborative learning. The conclusion can also be drawn that students’ level of motivation for collaborative learning positively correlates with their improvement in academic achievement. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "This paper explores the ways in which digital technologies are now implicated in the work - and specifically the labour - of school teachers. Drawing upon qualitative studies in two Australian high schools, the paper examines the variety of ways in which teachers' work is now enacted and experienced along digital lines. In particular, the paper highlights the association of digital technologies with the standardization, evidencing, intensification and altered affect of teachers' work. The paper questions the extent to which these trends might be seen as constituting 'new' forms of labour, with the research data pointing to continuities and disjunctures in terms of teachers' autonomy and professionalization. The paper also considers how these conditions are experienced in different ways across the teaching workforce. The paper concludes by reflecting on how fairer and/or empowering working conditions might be achievable through alternate uses of digital technology. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "This study investigated whether school organizational variables (ie, transformative leadership (TL), ICT-infrastructure (technical and social) and organizational learning climate were related to teachers' dispositional variables (ie, attitude, perceived norm and perceived behavior control [PBC]). The direct and indirect influences of the organizational variables on teachers' intention and use of digital learning materials (DLMs) were also investigated. A longitudinal design was used with three measurements spread out over four years. A total number of 544 randomly selected teachers from the Dutch primary, secondary and vocational education responded to all questionnaires. Model fit was tested using structural equation modeling. All dispositional variables predicted the use of DLMs, mediated by teachers' intention. TL had direct and indirect relationships via ICT-infrastructure and learning climate with attitude, perceived norm and PBC. The longitudinal design proved the chronological effect of TL on learning climate and the dispositional variables. However, not all TL dimensions had relationships with ICT-infrastructure (only TL-vision and TL-intellectual stimulation) and with learning climate (only TL-intellectual stimulation). For educational practice, the results indicated that leadership can promote teachers' use of DLMs directly and by supporting a school wide learning climate under the condition that an ICT-infrastructure exists.

        "Understanding how well teachers integrate digital technology in learning is the subject of considerable debate in education. High Possibility Classrooms (HPC) is a pedagogical framework drawn from research on exemplary teachers’ knowledge of technology integration in Australian school classrooms. The framework is being used to support teachers who teach various stages of schooling to take ‘pedagogical steps’ in their practice with technology. This article focuses on the use of the HPC conceptual framework in a study of seven teachers and their students at two secondary schools in New South Wales, Australia. Analysis confirms the practicality of this conceptual framework for technology integration in secondary school classrooms. This inquiry has implications for addressing the reluctance of teachers to integrate technology in curriculum. The article concludes by suggesting that more schools might consider using conceptual frameworks like HPC to support secondary school teachers to enhance student learning with technology.

        "This study investigated the use of digital learning objects in elementary and secondary schools. The specific objectives were: a) to identify the frequency with which learning object are used by teachers, the type of object most frequently used, the teaching strategies that is more frequently adopted, the main reason for the use of learning objects in the classroom, and how teachers normally research and locate them; b) to investigate the existence of statistically significant relationships between personal variables and the variables related to the use of objects; and c) to check the opinion of the teacher as to whether the school offers adequate infrastructure conditions to allow teachers to work with objects. An online questionnaire was answered by 992 teachers - of whom 187 were Brazilian and 805 were French. The data were statistically and qualitatively analysed. The learning objects most mentioned by the teachers were: images, videos, and software. The two main teaching strategies were a simple demonstration using a learning object or assigning a related activity to complement the demonstration. The two main reasons for educational use were to motivate the students for their studies and to help the in the learning of new concepts based on the features of the objects. Significant differences ( P < 0.05) were found between the samples of French and Brazilian teachers. Personal variables proved to be related to the use of learning objects. The data reinforces the importance of training teachers in the use of learning objects and teaching strategies that contribute to the knowledge construction process in an interactive way, while taking into consideration the characteristics of technology.

        "Lefebvre's triadic conception of spatial practice, representations of space and representational spaces provides the theoretical framework of this article, which recognises a productive relationship between space and social relations. Its writing stems from a current and ongoing qualitative study of innovative teaching and learning practices in new technology-rich flexible learning spaces, characterised by large open spaces, permeable boundaries and diverse furnishings emphasising student comfort, health and flexibility. Schooling in the twenty-first century, certainly in the developed world, is required to ensure that children and school-leavers have appropriate life-long skills in preparation for participation in the twenty-first century knowledge economy. This world is characterised as complex and dynamic, deeply influenced by globalisation and the revolution in digital technology. Developing these skills calls into question 'outmoded' transmission models of teaching and requires teachers and school leaders to approach their work in radically new ways. Open school design encourages flexibility in learning and teaching, and allows collaborative, team teaching, with designers claiming significant educational benefits. This arrangement of multiple classes using innovatively designed, technology-enriched common space, facilitated by multiple teachers, working in collaborative teams, is far-reaching in its likely implications for community expectations and responses, relationshipbuilding, assessment, student learning, teachers' work and initial teacher education.

        "• Internet bandwidth affects student ability to participate in remote learning. • Fiber, 5G, smart city, and satellite internet will improve digital infrastructure. • Schools must defend against cybersecurity threats to protect student data. • Training teachers, parents and staff can be valuable for online learning. The COVID-19 pandemic led to a rapid digitization of education in the United States. Before the pandemic, 1:1 computing initiatives, learning management systems, and professional development were in use. Students and teachers becoming reliant on technology when school buildings were closed showed the areas where eLearning technologies are effective and areas in which they need refinement in their design and implementation. In this paper, we address the history and current challenges in working with online learning infrastructure. We review standards prior to 2020 and then review technologies that were available during the initial phases of the pandemic. Finally, we discuss new tools, including our tool, for managing some of the network problems teachers faced while delivering content. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "The aim of this study is to contribute to an increased understanding of the flipped classroom movement. A total of 7 teachers working in school years 4-9 and who both actively flipped their classrooms and had been early adopters in this movement were interviewed. Two research questions were posed: “What characterizes flipped classroom instruction according to the teachers?” and “What objectives do the flipped classroom meet according to the teachers?” Regarding the first research question, a characteristic of a flipped classroom was “the flip,” a task to be accomplished outside the classroom before class. In relation to the second research question we found three objectives: Student activity in class; Educational change; Being part of a digital learning community. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "This paper draws on an empirical work dedicated to discussing a theoretical model for design-based research. The context of our study is a research project for the design, the implementation and the analysis of Insectophagia, a digital role-play game implemented in secondary schools. The model presented in this paper aims at conceptualizing researchers' and practitioners' relationships with the notion that knowledge development takes place at a meta-didactical level when the participants develop a shared practice and a shared discourse on practice (a common praxeology). This is done through collaboration and teacher-centered design of innovative learning settings. This model emerges from a double approach: (1) a literature review on collaborative research in education and, (2) an analysis of the verbal interactions of practitioners and researchers involved in the project. The study emphasizes the development of knowledge among participants. It also emphasizes the importance of knowledge brokering for filling the gap between research and practice and thus, for the adoption of digital technology by practitioners. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "This study compared the effects of three different feedback formats provided to sixth grade mathematics students within a web-based online learning platform, ASSISTments. A sample of 196 students were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: (1) text-based feedback; (2) image-based feedback; and (3) correctness only feedback. Regardless of condition, students solved a set of problems pertaining to the division of fractions by fractions. This mathematics content was representative of challenging sixth grade mathematics Common Core State Standard (6.NS.A.1). Students randomly assigned to receive text-based feedback (Condition A) or image-based feedback (Condition B) outperformed those randomly assigned to the correctness only group (Condition C). However, these differences were not statistically significant (F(2,108) = 1.394,p = .25). Results of this study also demonstrated a completion-bias. Students randomly assigned to Condition B were less likely to complete the problem set than those assigned to Conditions A and C. To conclude, we discuss the counterintuitive findings observed in this study and implications related to developing and implementing feedback in online learning environments for middle school mathematics.

        "In Denmark, 1:1 classroom has been implemented in all public schools (grades 1-9). Each student regularly accesses, processes, produces and exchanges written material using a computer (PC, laptop, tablet, etc.). These devices are considered as tools to enhance educational objectives, and in the article I present findings from research about how these devices might be used to enhance the students' acquisition of literacy skills. An internationally comparative analysis by the OECD of the digital skills that students have acquired shows no appreciable improvements in student achievement in reading in the countries that 'had invested heavily in educational technology'. The Danish cases presented in this paper, however, identify ways of using digital technology in order to improve student digital literacy skills. They provide evidence suggesting a positive influence on student reading, creating and sharing of learning material in 1:1 classrooms. The results gained are considered critical in the sense that they can be generalized with a view to future development of 1:1 educational initiatives. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "Background: Prosthodontics involves replacing lost dentofacial structures using artificial substitutes. Due to availability of many materials and techniques, clinician’s clinical decision‑making regarding appropriate selection of prosthesis requires critical thinking abilities and is demanding. Especially during graduate training years, learners do not receive the exposure to a variety of cases, thus their clinical reasoning skills are not developed optimally. Therefore, using the trend of incorporating technology in education, we developed a mobile learning app for this purpose. The aim of this study was to evaluate learners’ perceptions of this app’s utility and impact on their clinical decision‑making skills. Methods: After taking informed consent, interns of the Department of Prosthodontics of VSPM Dental College, Nagpur, India, during the academic year May 2015–May 2016 were sent the link for the app to be installed in their Android smartphones. Their perceptions were recorded on a feedback questionnaire using 5‑point Likert scale. The script concordance test (SCT) was used to check for changes in clinical reasoning abilities. Results: Out of 120 students who were sent the link, 102 downloaded the link and 92 completed the feedback questionnaire and appeared for the SCT (response rate: 76%). The overall response to the app was positive for more than two‑thirds of interns, who reported a greater confidence in their clinical decision‑making around prostheses through this app and 94% of the students felt that this app should be regularly used along with conventional teaching techniques. Mean SCT scores were pretest 41.5 (±1.7) and posttest 63 (±2.4) (P < 0.005). Discussion: Clinical decision‑making in prosthodontics, a mobile learning app, is an effective way to improve clinical reasoning skills for planning prosthodontic rehabilitation. It is well received by students. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

This study aims to explore the engagement of Malaysia secondary school students with dyslexia and students without dyslexia on various synchronous and asynchronous communication interaction technologies in an online collaborative learning environment. Multiple case within subject qualitative study was employed to investigate the engagement of students using a semi structured interview guideline. The findings revealed that (1) text chat is unsuitable for learning discussion for all learners, (2) forum affords self-paced and organized formal discussion for most learners and (3) video conferencing is suitable for interactive face-to-face, verbal discussion for most learners.

        "The increasingly widespread use of social network sites to expand and deepen one's social connections is a relatively new but potentially important phenomenon that has implications for teaching and learning and teacher education in the 21st century. This paper surveys the educational research literature to examine: How such technologies are perceived and used by K-12 learners and teachers with what impacts on pedagogy or students' learning. Selected studies were summarized and categorized according to the four types introduced by Roblyer (2005) as studies most needed to move the educational technology field forward. These include studies that establish the technology's effectiveness at improving student learning; investigate implementation strategies; monitor social impact; and report on common uses to shape the direction of the field. We found the most prevalent type of study conducted related to our focal topic was research on common uses. The least common type of study conducted was research that established the technology's effectiveness at improving student learning. Implications for the design of future research and teacher education initiatives are discussed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "This paper aims to investigate how a gamified learning approach influences science learning, achievement and motivation, through a context-aware mobile learning environment, and explains the effects on motivation and student learning. A series of gamified learning activities, based on MGLS (Mobile Gamification Learning System), was developed and implemented in an elementary school science curriculum to improve student motivation and to help students engage more actively in their learning activities. The responses to our questionnaire indicate that students valued the outdoor learning activities made possible by the use of a smartphone and its functions. Pre- and post-test results demonstrated that incorporating mobile and gamification technologies into a botanical learning process could achieve a better learning performance and a higher degree of motivation than either non-gamified mobile learning or traditional instruction. Further, they revealed a positive relationship between learning achievement and motivation. The correlation coefficient for ARCS dimensions and post-test shows that the ARCS-A (attention) is greater than ARCS-R, ARCS-C and ARCS-S. This means that the attention (ARCS-A) of this system is an important dimension in this research. The results could provide parents, teachers and educational organizations with the necessary data to make more relevant educational decision. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "Evidence from large-scale studies of primary and secondary students’ technology practices at school over the last decade show disparities in student practices and suggest that schools need to do more to cater for all students. Research that explores the influence of social and cultural factors may be useful for understanding such inequality in student practice. Bourdieu’s theory of practice [(1977). Outline of a Theory of Practice. London: Cambridge University Press] is proposed as an example of a sociological theory that can be adopted in educational technology research to move towards understanding the wider complexities of technology practice. To encourage discourse and application of Bourdieu’s sociology in the field of educational technology research, this paper provides an introduction to the theory, a review of its application in research of primary and secondary students’ technology practice and relevant conceptual work. The paper presents a conceptual framework based on Bourdieu’s theory that has been developed through two recent studies, and review of empirical and conceptual works and invites its application in future research so that it can be critiqued and further developed.

        "This paper presents the Massively Open Online Course for Educators ( MOOC- Ed) network dataset. It entails information on two online communication networks resulting from two consecutive offerings of the MOOC called T he Digital Learning Transition in K-12 Schools in spring and fall 2013. The courses were offered to educators from the USA and abroad. Though based on the same course, minor controlled variations were made to both MOOCs in terms of the course length, discussion prompts and group size. The dataset provides opportunities to examine how participants leverage online communication forums to support their learning. In particular, it allows modeling network mechanisms to better understand factors that facilitate or impede the exchange of information among educators. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "• Reading to Dogs, animal-assisted Education, animal-assisted interventions. • Wellbeing. • Reading anxiety, attitudes and confidence. • Online learning. • Controlled feasibility study utilising mixed methods. This study evaluated an online multi-component Reading to Dogs (RTD) intervention named Paws and Learn (PAL). Designed as a controlled feasibility study (i.e., comparing an intervention and a control group, as well as evaluating the intervention's practicality for the classroom), this research examined the intervention's impact on children's wellbeing, reading affect and frequency (RAF), children and teachers' perceptions and experiences of PAL; and implementation considerations for the classroom. PAL consists of five components, one of which is RTD, complemented by four additional components designed to increase connection to the dog (whom they only meet virtually) and increase and consolidate benefits. RTD in schools is growing in international popularity and prevalence yet concerns about the practice exist. Online PAL was informed by a survey of teachers' perspectives of RTD, and a co-design process combining research and practice. A pre-post-test control group design, with a mixed method evaluation was adopted. In total, N =106 pupils (aged 9) and their teachers from 3 schools participated in the 4-week study. Measures included wellbeing and RAF questionnaires, and interviews with intervention class teachers (N = 3) and a sub-sample of children (n = 33). In general, no statistically significant differences were found in wellbeing, reading affect or frequency, however qualitative insights revealed positive perceptions and experiences of online PAL, specifically in relation to wellbeing and reading affect. Online PAL was deemed feasible for classroom use, particularly if technological challenges can be overcome. Implications for the delivery of RTD interventions are discussed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "Pollinating animals are profoundly affected by the current loss of biodiversity, a problem that is of concern to science, policy-makers and the public. One possibility to raise awareness for pollinator conservation is education. Unfortunately, insects such as bees are often perceived as frightening creatures; a negative emotion that may hinder successful learning processes. Thus, any educational initiative must conquer this obstacle and promote conservational knowledge. Using a quasi-experimental design, we evaluated the effectiveness of an educational programme using two student-centred learning approaches: One by encountering living honeybees (Apis mellifera) at a beehive (N = 162), the other by using an eLearning tool connected to a remote beehive (N = 192). We monitored secondary school students’ environmentally relevant knowledge of bees, their environmental attitudes and their perception of bees in regard to conservation and dangerousness. The results indicate that both approaches lead to the acquisition of conservational knowledge in the short and medium term. Direct experiences with nature are regarded as crucial, but using an eLearning tool in environmental education constitutes an outstanding alternative to acquire knowledge. Adolescents with low ‘green’ attitudes responded positively to the online beehive, and the perceived danger of bees played no role in the learning process. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "The ubiquity of the Internet and digital technology has changed the way we access information, interact and learn. In the UK, ICT has been given the status of a 'skill for life' along with Literacy, Language and Numeracy. This has placed an onus on the teachers who must ensure that ICT is 'embedded' in the subjects they teach. Colleges have invested vast amounts of money into Virtual Learning Environments which have become depositories for learning materials developed by teachers. More recently, online conferencing tools have captured the imagination of EFL teachers. Tools such as skype or google hangouts allow them to interact with learners in real time. In this study I investigate the efficacy of synchronous online teaching and propose a model that can be effectively applied in online language teaching. This study also looks at adult learners' attitudes towards online learning and demonstrates that with careful planning this mode of delivery can be very motivating. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "In this article, we discuss the concept of gamification, based on a literature review and preliminary feedback from teachers using Classcraft, a role-playing game supported by a digital platform and a mobile application that were developed to answer high school teachers' classroom management needs. Our results come from two experiments in France and Quebec and also from an online survey that was made available on the Classcraft platform. These results promote a model of gamification that consists of considering the experience of the students, rather than the game itself, and they confirm that a game is consubstantial to its player. Therefore, we argue for the use of the term 'ludicization' to emphasize that transforming a situation into a game does not consist of using elements that have a game-like aspect, but rather of a non-essentialistic vision of play, generating a metaphor around the situation to build a reflexive space where the nature and meaning of interactions are modified.

        "While mobile learning (m-learning) has considerable potential, most of previous strategies for developing this new approach to education were analysed using the knowledge, experience and judgement of individuals, with the support of statistical software. Although these methods provide systematic steps for the implementation of m-learning strategies, they do not consider the correlations among the key success factors. This study aims to develop a decision support system for m-learning, and design m-learning activities that combine lessons in Chinese rhetoric with an outdoor learning activity at the National University of Tainan, in Taiwan. To verify the feasibility and value of the proposed decision support system for m-learning, the fuzzy analytic hierarchy process was used to analyse the three types of participants in this case study – college students, system developers and instructors from related fields. The evaluation indexes of the success factors of m-learning were used to obtain the opinions of each participant. The relative weight of each evaluation index was calculated, and the entire weight system of the indexes was established, which can then be used as a strategic tool for m-learning development.

        "Bridging schools and communities has been a goal, if not hurdle, for reformers who aim to improve the education of low-income and underrepresented students from the bottom-up. Strategies to create these connections are often characterized as 'brokerage', where individuals or organizations bridge two or more social worlds. This paper details the design and implementation of educational technologies that support the brokering of school-community connections using a 'culturally responsive computing' (CRC) framework. Culturally responsive education is often limited to content and learning styles, which misses the opportunities it creates for a brokerage process that also connects to education-based social movements for economic access in underrepresented communities. This paper provides empirical support for the claim that the CRC framework is well suited for both purposes. It allows schools and communities to build assets together, translating the knowledge and skills of underrepresented communities into math and computing education, while illuminating the ways in which technologies can motivate education-based social movement building.

        "Researchers around the world are interested in knowing how to support teachers in developing both their technology skills and their understanding of how educational technologies can provide opportunity to engage all learners at their skill and interest level in learning activities that were not possible without technology. The solution involves the design and development of teacher professional learning (PL). This study examines a snapshot of one school district, which has experienced a growth in available digital student technology occurring at the same time when teachers experienced a loss of traditional pen and paper resources. Qualitative and quantitative data were gathered and analysed to determine what features of PL would best support teachers in this district. These findings were then considered within the scope of government suggested policy, frameworks and reports. The final suggested framework is for a PL that is collaborative, grade and subject relevant; offers hands-on opportunities; is supported by coaching; is based on research; and is supported by leadership which provides both time and a collaboratively developed vision.

        "This study explored the relationship of in-service teacher achievement goal orientation and practices of educational technology use. Semi-structured individual interviews with secondary school teachers in Latvia (N= 16) and Estonia (N= 10) revealed that the use of information and communication technology (ICT) in pedagogical work and the ways in which teachers learn ICT-related skills are associated with individual differences in teacher achievement goal orientation. Based on their findings, the authors argue that achievement goal theory is a promising framework for understanding how the integration and application of ICT in teaching happens. Directions for future research and implications for teacher training are discussed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "There is now widespread recognition that digital technologies, particularly portable hand held devices capable of Internet connection, present opportunities and challenges to the way in which student learning is organized in schools, colleges and institutions of higher education in the 21st Century. Traxler, Journal of the Research Centre for Educational Technology, 6(1), 3-15 (2010) suggests such devices are pervasive and ubiquitous, conspicuous and unobtrusive, noteworthy and taken-for-granted with everyone typically owning one, using one and often having more than one. As a consequence it has been argued that the availability of such devices, controlled mainly by the student and not the teacher, has the potential to change the traditional dynamics and pedagogical patterns of the learning environment (Burden et al. 2012). Education institutions, however, typically remain organized around spatial and temporal considerations such as buildings, timetables, calendars and internal structures which are designed to classify and manage students. In the case study reported here students and faculty teaching staff from the College of Education in the Kuwait University were surveyed in order to assess their access to such technologies, their capability to use them effectively in support of achieving planned learning outcomes and the implications for change that could emanate from such findings.

        "This paper covers type one and two educational obstacles in using technology in the classrooms, and considering those obstacles tries to find the answer to the following overarching research question which can help to gauge some obstacles for the educational technology integration for elementary and high school education: What obstacles do teachers identify when integrating technology with instruction? This paper examines the educational obstacles like time to prepare materials and lessons for quality technology-rich lessons, policies and security restrictions, access to resources, and the level of comfort to use technology. Based on examining the type one and two obstacles, the goal is to gain a greater understanding as to why there is a disconnect between the seemingly common educational belief, that technology can and must be used in the twenty-first century classrooms, and actual classroom practices through evaluating the mentioned obstacles.

        "This paper presents a study on discovery learning of scientific concepts with the support of computer simulation. In particular, the paper will focus on the effect of the levels of guidance on students with a low degree of experience in informatics and educational technology. The first stage of this study was to identify the common misconceptions about density, starting from a literature review. Forty eight students (25 M and 23 F) from two high schools in Vanuatu were then involved in the study. These students were divided into three groups according to the different levels of guidance they received (Unguided; Minimum guidance, Maximum guidance). A pre and post activity questionnaire was designed containing 12 questions. The students underwent a training session with computer simulation about density. Using a descriptive and an inferential statistics method, scores obtained from the three different groups were compared during pre-test and post-test analyses. From the analyses it was found that the construction of knowledge from discovery learning activities occurs with or without guidance, however the amount of guidance received has an influence on the depth of conceptual understanding.

        "3 D virtual worlds are promising for immersive learning in English as a Foreign Language ( EFL). Unlike English as a Second Language ( ESL), EFL typically takes place in the learners' home countries, and the potential of the language is limited by geography. Although learning contexts where English is spoken is important, in most EFL courses at the college level, EFL is taught by acquiring vocabularies, grammar and pragmatic features without contextual immersion. In this study, an immersive English learning environment in a 3 D virtual world, Open Simulator, was developed with two key learning artifacts, chatbot and time machine. A single-factor, independent measures design was used to examines learners' presence under four learning conditions: virtual learning environment without digital learning artifacts ( VE), virtual learning environment with chatbot ( VEC), virtual learning environment with time machine ( VETM) and virtual learning environment with chatbot and time machine ( VECTM). Three research questions emerging from the four learning conditions form the backbone of this study: (1) Does chatbot increase language learners' presence in the immersive virtual English learning environment? (2) Does time machine increase language learners' presence in the immersive virtual English learning environment? (3) Does the combined use of chatbot and time machine increase presence more than either learning artifact alone? The experimental results indicate that the chatbot and time machine increase the learners' sense of immersion and presence. Best design practices should address how immersion and presence can be integrated into affordances of virtual worlds. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "Low foreign language achievers in vocational education often have a lack of learning strategies, a tendency to feel frustrated, and unwillingness to be involved. In order to develop vocational college students’ autonomy, this study integrated on-site workshops with an online learning community by means of self-directed learning English for specific purposes (ESP). The results show that the online ESP community developed students into autonomous learners by (1) employing resource-based approach to download learning materials for preview and review, (2) utilizing curriculum-based approach to view online photos for monitoring their role-play and interactions in the learning processes and taking e-assessment for evaluating learning progress, and (3) using technology-based approach for interacting with their peers. The students developed learner autonomy to achieve significant better learning outcomes in the post-test. It was implied that self-directed learning with little teacher intervention of integrating on-site and online learning community could develop learner autonomy in ESP. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "One of the important and challenging objectives of social studies courses is to promote students' affective domain exhibition, including learning interest, positive attitudes and local culture identity. In this paper, a location-aware mobile learning approach was proposed based on a competition strategy for conducting local cultural activities in the field. During the field trip, the learners were asked to learn in the mobile learning environment by throwing a dice to determine their moves using a tablet computer. Each move was related to a problem-based learning task associated with the corresponding real-world target at the specified location. To assess the effects of the peer competition-based mobile learning approach on students' affective domain exhibition, a quasi-experimental design was employed to conduct a learning activity in the social studies course of an elementary school. From the experimental results, it was found that the proposed approach significantly improved the students' local culture identity, learning interest, and learning attitudes; moreover, it also decreased their cognitive load when guiding them to learn in the field trip.

        "Background Prior to high-stakes examinations, teachers may use value-promoting messages ( VPMs) to communicate to students the value and importance of their forthcoming examinations in the hope that they will adopt adaptive learning and study behaviours. These messages can focus on achieving success (gain-framed) or avoiding failure (loss-framed). Aims This study examined how secondary school students appraised hypothetical gain- and loss-framed VPMs, and how these appraisals differed according to self-reported levels of attainment value ( AV) and academic self-efficacy ( ASE). Samples In total, 539 secondary school students (284 male, 255 female, mean age 14.8 years) were participated in this study. Methods Participants completed self-report measures of AV and ASE and appraised hypothetical VPMs as challenging, threatening, or irrelevant (disregard). Participants were randomly assigned to a gain- or loss-framed condition. Results A challenge appraisal was greater in students with higher AV and ASE. A threat appraisal was greater in students with higher AV and lower ASE. A disregard appraisal was higher in students with lower AV. Message frame did not interact with AV or ASE in the appraisal of VPMs as challenging, threatening, or irrelevant. Conclusions Educational practitioners should consider the characteristics of their students before using VPMs. In particular, they may not be effective for students high in AV and low in ASE. They are likely to be ineffective for students low in AV. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "Mobile devices are becoming ubiquitous in our society and more so with school aged children. In order to get the most out of the portable computing power present at students' fingertips, this paper proposes an approach for providing mobile, personalized course content tailored to each individual's learning style while incorporating adaptive context awareness. The respective approach has been implemented as an iOS application and the results of an evaluation with 45 students show that students were able to improve their comprehension of a subject matter by 23 % after using the application. The evaluation further demonstrated that not only is personalized mobile adaptive learning a successful method of instruction, but it is also very popular with the students who have used it.

        "Constructing the digital learning environment for ubiquitous learning and asynchronous distributed learning has opened up immense amounts of concrete research. However, current digital learning environments do not fully fulfill the expectations on supporting interactive group learning, shared understanding and social construction of knowledge. This paper introduces cloud computing to the construction of the digital learning environment for its on-demand services with high reliability, scalability and availability in the distributed environment. Then a digital learning environment based on cloud computing ( DLECC) is proposed, including the architecture, co-construction and sharing model, and incentive mechanism of DLECC. Finally, an Educational Technology Space ( ETS) platform under the concept of DLECC is constructed and applied to the educational technology training for 110 teachers from primary and secondary schools. The experimental results demonstrate that the co-construction and sharing model and incentive mechanism of DLECC may provide meaningful learning support and interactive communities and promote the co-construction of befitting educational resources.

        "We reviewed literature from 2007 to 2016 (March) on mobile language learning in authentic environments. We aimed to understand publications’ trend, research focus, technology used, methodology, and current issues. Our results showed that there was increasing trend in the publications. Students’ perceptions towards mobile learning technologies and language proficiency were the most common research topics. The most frequently used technologies were smartphones, mobile phones, and personal digital assistants, whereas the most common target language was English as a foreign language. In addition, university and elementary school students were the most common participants. We found that learning activities in most studies were carried out in classroom and specified locations outside of campus. Authentic learning environments in most studies were familiar to students and learning activities were designed using instructor-centered approach. Most studies collected and analyzed qualitative and quantitative data. We also discovered some issues associated with earlier studies, e.g. many studies did not focus on applying newly learned knowledge by students to solve their real-life problems or recently developed intelligent technologies for language learning were overlooked. Based on our results, we discuss some implications and make suggestions over mobile language learning in authentic environments for the educators and researchers. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "Our work is set against the backdrop of the pervasive discussion of harnessing online games to provide students with new constructivist learning opportunities. Upon the theoretical foundation, we have developed Virtual Interactive Student- Oriented Learning Environment ( VISOLE), a teaching framework for implementing constructivist online game-based learning in formal curriculum teaching in school education. In this paper, apart from underlining the pedagogical features of VISOLE, we discuss our study on investigating 118 teachers' concerns about this educational innovation with the Stages of Concern ( SoC) model, in terms of five categorical concerns-Evaluation, Information, Management, Consequence and Refocusing. All participants had completed our VISOLE induction training before they participated in the SoC survey. Results revealed that their Management concern was the most intense. With this 'diagnostic' knowledge, we can formulate more precise interventions addressing teachers' actual needs so as to assist them in the adoption of VISOLE at school. The findings also shed light on designing, developing or appropriating online games to support learning and teaching in school education. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "Augmented reality (AR) has been recognized as a potential technology to help students link what they are observing in the real world to their prior knowledge. One of the most challenging issues of AR-based learning is the provision of effective strategy to help students focus on what they need to observe in the field. In this study, a competitive gaming approach is proposed to support AR-based learning activities conducted in real-world contexts. An experiment has been conducted on an elementary school ecology course to explore the effectiveness of the proposed approach in comparison with the conventional AR-based mobile learning approach in field trips. The experimental results show that the AR-based gaming approach can improve not only students' learning attitudes, but also their learning performance on the field trip. Accordingly, discussions and some suggestions for future work are provided. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "The rapid global uptake of mobile technology is reflected in pioneering New Zealand schools. Teachers of classes where each student uses a mobile device were surveyed on how frequently they use various mobile learning activities and asked to describe the new pedagogical opportunities it offers. The teachers' m-learning pedagogical approaches and the extent of transformation were considered. This study finds the main use of mobile technology is to enhance learning with task activities and information access; however, innovative content production is also common. The opportunities for pedagogical transformation that collaborative learning offers appear to be partially realised, but the potential for situative learning using authentic contexts and experts seems to be largely unrealised. Presently, transformative pedagogical approaches are not prevalent despite collaborative inquiry and situative approaches with authentic contexts being linked to developing higher order thinking and fostering future focused skills, which are a key focus for educators. The use of one-to-one mobile technology in the classroom is a new educational practice with significant potential. This study provides a snapshot to contribute to building the necessary body of work on m-learning pedagogical transformation. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "This mixed methods study examines whether engaging in a problem-solving project to create Math-eos (digital videos) increases pre-service teachers' understanding of the relationship between visual, auditory, and verbal representation and critical thinking in mathematics. Additionally, the study looks at what aspects of a digital problem solving project support pre-service teachers' ability to integrate digital technology in mathematics education. Results indicated that, as pre-service teachers worked through the writing/problem solving process and constructed digital stories, or Math-eos, they became more aware of the advantages of using this multimodal approach to teach mathematical concepts to elementary and middle school students. The Math-eo Project provided pre-service teachers, who typically used digital media only for socializing and meeting web-based course requirements, with a new tool for their own learning and teaching. Designing Math-eos also enabled them to integrate digital technology in the mathematics curriculum with the aim of increasing student engagement, motivation and knowledge. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

In this pre- and posttest experimental comparison study, data were collected from 132 fourth graders through an achievement test. The same math problem-solving tasks were provided to the experimental and control groups in the VR learning setting. Tasks for the experimental group involved the game characteristics of challenges, a storyline, immediate rewards, and the integration of game-play in the learning content. Analysis of covariance with the achievement test results indicated a significant effect of game-based learning (GBL) in the VR environment, in comparison with non-GBL in the VR environment, in promoting math knowledge test performance.

        "Large quantities of data are now being generated, collated and processed within schools through computerised systems and other digital technologies. In response to growing concerns over the efficiency and equity of how these data are used, the concept of ‘open data’ has emerged as a potential means of using digital technology to democratise data access and use within whole school communities. Drawing on participatory design research in two Australian secondary schools, this paper explores the possibilities of making existing school data openly available in digitised form for teachers, administrators and students to access, interpret and use. The results of these interventions – while only partially successful – provide valuable insights into the technical, informatic, organisational and social issues surrounding the use of data in schools. The paper concludes by considering the practical and theoretical limitations of attempting to democratise data engagement within school settings. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "Technology is a dominant mediating factor impacting on current human behaviour and social change, which both acts on and is acted upon by other phenomena. This changing social landscape, along with new expectations and requirements, drives our educational priorities and curriculum agenda. There is no denying the prevalence of technology found in the statements and guidelines of the national Australian Curriculum. Further, theNational Review of School Music Educationidentified the importance of technology in school music education in 2005. The curriculum guidelines illustrate an understanding of technology in Music and the Arts that is both vague and limiting. In 2015 we are at a point of curriculum stasis, an equilibrium that highlights a disconnect between music, technology and Australian music education. This article investigates current secondary school Years 7–10 (ages 11–15 years) Music and Arts curriculum statements concerning the use of technology and compares this to the general capability information and computer technology (ICT) curricula. There is wide recognition that digital technology is essential in teaching and learning, but this is not reflected in contemporary Australian Arts and Music curricula. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "This article explores the idea of pedagogic affect in both onsite and online graphic design learning spaces, and speculates on the role that this affect plays in the formation of the design student. I argue that embodied design knowledge is built by interactions with design professionals, activities that mimic the daily work of designers, and practices of display such as exemplar student work galleries within design schools. Therefore bodies in motion, and the places they move within, take on more importance in the making-up of a graphic design student than we may expect. This idea has obvious implications for online design learning. Drawing on concepts from both Actor-Network Theory (ANT) and Non-Representational Theory (NRT), this article works three empirical instances of affect. The analysis presented is targeted towards exploring the contribution of affect to teaching in onsite and online learning spaces. As the practices described here carry through time and space to other design schools, the findings put forward have implications for a broad suite of practices in design education. Thinking through how affect plays out in the onsite design school points the way towards the creation of more vibrant online learning spaces. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "The music industry in the 21st century uses digital technology in a wide range of applications including in performance, in composition and in recording and publishing. In this article, I consider how the impact of digital technologies may be affecting pedagogical processes adopted by secondary music teachers, particularly in the area of composition. This paper examines qualitative data gathered from teachers in four schools participating in a larger research project. Data collected in this paper came from a number of semi-structured interviews. Findings indicate that although the majority of teachers involved in this research remain fundamentally conservative in their approaches to teaching composition, focusing on more procedural rather than creative activities, some music teachers do make radical changes to their pedagogy in contexts where this is important to their students’ engagement and supported by their school.

        "Supporting and upskilling teachers are essential to enhancing the quality of learning in developing contexts – the focus of Education For All – yet little evidence exists concerning what kinds of teacher education are actually most effective and what changes in ‘quality’ are desired and feasible. This paper illustrates how a concrete, research-informed school-based, model of professional development in sub-Saharan Africa can address the quality agenda. It reports on a trial of a pioneering, multimedia programme supporting interactive mathematics and science teaching using open educational resources and classroom digital technology, where available. The programme was carefully adapted to the Zambian context and ran weekly for one school year with 12 teachers in a low-resourced primary school. The study examined the impact on teachers' thinking and classroom practices. Data were derived from observations, lesson and workshop recordings, teacher interviews, portfolios and audio diaries. Through a teacher-led workshop approach and trialling new pedagogical strategies, teachers raised their expectations of pupils, adapted to learners’ knowledge levels, used more practical and group work, and integrated technology use. Pupils built deeper understanding of subject matter, were actively engaged, worked collaboratively and used digital technologies for problem-solving. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "Technological advances in the form of ubiquitous computing has altered the learning landscape today. Contemporary modes of learning afford curricular innovations in schools. While learning journeys of decades ago entailed field trips to places of interest such as museums and zoos where students completed tasks or worksheets after each trip, the learning journeys of today are facilitated by technological tools such as smart devices and global positioning systems. Learners are moving away from being mere content consumers through technology-facilitated dialoguing and content creation (Tay and Lee 2014; Tan et al. 2011). In this paper we unpack tenets of a technology-facilitated curricular innovation (CI) through a case study analysis of the development and implementation of a Digital Learning Trails (DLT) project. Through tracing the trajectory of the DLT project, we identify factors related to the scalability and sustainability of this CI that was developed in one school and subsequently used by more than 200 schools in Singapore. We posit that scaling curricular innovations in schools can be conceptually provisioned through a rhizomatic lens where innovation is characterized by multiple trajectories, allowing for recontextualizations of CIs. We argue that, (1) the pedagogic process in the context of education and scaling is based on supporting apprentice-schools to make multiple recontextualizations; (2) the enculturation process of a school adopting and implementing a particular innovation is based on a rhizomatic rather than linear, conception of the development of expertise; and (3) the process of CI implementation is based on developing the capability to not only make multiple recontextualizations but also to accumulate enough capital to send out new 'roots and shoots' as it spreads.

        "Schools are highly regulated sites of digital technology use. This article draws upon survey data from students (n = 1174) across three Australian secondary schools, examining their experiences and perceptions of school regulation of technology use, as well as the ways in which students accommodate and/or work around such constraints. The data highlight a number of different forms of regulation that students perceive as impeding their in-school engagement with technology - most notably relating to filtering/blocking of content; (dis)possession of personal devices; enforced uses and standardized practices. Conversely, a number of tactics of contestation are also highlighted - including surreptitious uses of digital media; low-level \"hacks\" and technical reconfigurations; and various other forms of subversion. The article concludes by considering the implications of these findings, and the need for school authorities to work with students to develop negotiated forms of regulation that support expansive and increasingly personalized uses of technology within the school context.

        "Teachers' perception of changes to their teaching practice, with respect to digital technology use in secondary school mathematics, during their participation in a research project are reported. Two case studies are presented of teacher perspectives illustrative of the range of perceived changes teachers made to their practice and positions along the ‘path of change’ during their participation in the project. Participating in a project supportive of teacher change and resulting in perception of substantial change was necessary, but not sufficient, to meet the goal of transformative use of digital technologies to increase the level of cognitive demand experienced by students.

        "Digital technology is changing every aspect of life from how we communicate to the way we learn. International trends would suggest that digital access is becoming increasingly widespread in developed countries. But general trends may hide the fact that some households still do not have access to the internet for a variety of reasons. Differences in digital access and use, particularly along socio-economic lines, may be less visible but are still present. This paper reports on a two-phase study that explores home digital access and use of young people (16-17-years-old) from a range of socio-economic backgrounds across New Zealand. Phase one sought to establish what home access is available, while the second phase explores what kinds of digital technologies are used and for what purpose among a subset of young people. Results indicate that differences in digital access do exist among young people from different socio-economic backgrounds. These differences include the number of digital devices in the home, the types of devices available, and whether the device(s) are shared or individually owned. These findings are particularly important in light of the finding that these young people perceived that digital access and use at school is inadequate and lagging behind everyday use. This suggests that there is still a considerable way to go to ensure equal digital opportunities for all. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "This study examines the classroom practice and craft knowledge underpinning one teacher's integration of the use of GeoGebra software into mathematics teaching. The chosen teacher worked in an English secondary school and was professionally well regarded as an accomplished user of digital technology in mathematics teaching. Designed in accordance with the Structuring Features of Classroom Practice framework (Ruthven, 2009), the study triangulates evidence from lesson observations and post-lesson interviews to analyse how this teacher's classroom practice and professional knowledge support the integration of technology. This analysis shows how the teacher managed a number of aspects of classroom teaching related to using GeoGebra such as including technology-mediated tasks aligned with his pedagogical goals, preparing his students to use the technology efficiently, adapting formats for classroom activity and extending his curriculum scripts for the topics studied.

        "Most ubiquitous learning researchers use resource recommendation and retrieving based on context to provide contextualized learning resources, but it is the kind of one-way context matching. Learners always obtain fixed digital learning resources, which present all learning contents in any context. This study proposed a dynamic ubiquitous learning resource model with context. The model has context information and a flexible content structure that allows contents to be adjusted dynamically in different contexts, thus providing learners the contextualized resources that best match their contexts. In order to verify the effects of the contextualized resources, a contrast experiment was carried out in a vocational school in China. The experimental results showed that the contextualized resources could better improve learners' learning achievement and efficiency, improve their self-learning efficiency while reducing their cognitive load. Learners thought the ubiquitous learning system which provided contextualized resources was more useful. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "As the advance of learning technologies and analytics tools continues, learning management systems (LMSs) have been required to fulfil the growing expectations for smart learning. However, the reality regarding the level of technology integration in higher education differs considerably from such expectations or the speed of advances in educational technologies. This research aimed to evaluate the current activation levels and usage patterns of a LMS. A large data-set was analysed, which included the online activity information from 7940 courses. Through data pre-processing, general indicators reflecting login frequencies of the virtual campus and activity-based indicators presenting the activation patterns of diverse functions provided by Moodle were derived. Activity theory was applied to interpret the results of analysis, since it has been recognised as a powerful framework to understand phenomena encompassing interactive systems. Further, time-series investigation over three consecutive semesters allowed observation of historical changes. The results revealed considerably low use of the virtual campus with only slight changes, as well as significantly different activity patterns across course attributes and colleges. Contradictions among components in the activity system are discussed, along with the implications for improving teaching and learning with LMS in higher education. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "The study examines Israel's educational technology policy in light of the coming-of-age of ICT. The study shows the ways it has been developing, and identifies two major shifts which have occurred in recent years: the introduction of the national educational cloud, and the enabling of the “bring your own device” (BYOD) policy. The way Israeli decision-makers perceive the relationship between education, society, and technology, and the forces involved in shaping the policy is analyzed. Technology in education is perceived as a solution to societal and educational problems and as an unstoppable force. Efforts to implement technology in education have been made without significant awareness of the dialectical nature of technology. Two different implementation approaches compete. I illustrate the connection between the Ministry of Education’s organizational structure and the nature of the implementation of national ICT curricular programs. Findings also reveal ongoing disruption regarding policy between Israel’s academia, teachers’ colleges, and the Ministry of Education. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "Project-based learning (PBL) is an active student-centred form of instruction which is characterised by students’ autonomy, constructive investigations, goal-setting, collaboration, communication and reflection within real-world practices. It has been explored in various contexts and in different phases of schooling, from primary to higher education. The majority of the reviewed studies were based on a quasi-experimental pretest–posttest design with some baseline equivalence established but no random allocation of participants to control and experimental groups, and as a result, a causal link between PBL instruction and positive student outcomes cannot be established with certainty. Modern digital technology, group processes of high quality, teachers’ ability to effectively scaffold students’ learning and provide guidance and support, the balance between didactic instruction with in-depth inquiry methods and well-aligned assessment have been identified in the literature as facilitating factors in the implementation of PBL. The article concludes with six key recommendations considered to be essential for the successful adoption of a PBL approach in the mainstream school setting. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "This paper reveals the main trends and characteristics of the use of multimedia means in distance learning of technical subjects at graduate schools; analyses the peculiarities of presentation and perception of information in multimedia environment; studies genre and topic structure of multimedia means used for distance learning. The author has developed a technology of distance learning for teaching such subjects as 'Theoretical Mechanics' and 'Material Mechanics'; the technology is based on the use of tests and test training setsin the theory course, which is accompanied by video materials filmed during lectures and practical seminars. A distance learning system will allow to: educate an unlimited number of students during unlimited time; check the student knowledge during the exams, track and control study results and dynamics for each student regardless of his/her physical location, create exclusive online courses based on traditional courses of experienced educators, significantly reduce in-class hours for full-time students, therefore, reducing the resources spent on office facilities, significantly increase the profits of school comparing to those received from traditional education. The Moodle system, which is an application for online learning, was used as the basis for the online course. The most useful multimedia technologies as well as technologies requiring improvements have been identified. The promising option of multimedia technology with the use of virtual reality has been proposed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "The rise of learning analytics, the application of complex metrics developed to exploit the proliferation of ‘Big Data’ in educational work, raises important moral questions about the nature of what is measurable in education. Teachers, schools and nations are increasingly held to account based on metrics, exacerbating the tendency for fine-grained measurement of learning experiences. In this article, the origins of learning analytics ontology are explored, drawing upon core ideas in the philosophy of computing, such as the general definition of information and the information-theoretic account of knowledge. Drawing upon a reading of DescartesMeditatio II, which extends the phenomenology of Jean-Luc Marion into a pedagogy of intentionality, the article identifies a fundamental incompatibility between the subjective experience of learning and the information-theoretic account of knowledge. Human subjects experience and value their own information incommensurably with the ways in which computers measure and quantify information. The consequences of this finding for the design of online learning environments, and the necessary limitations of learning analytics and measurement are explored. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "High-quality family childcare (FCC) can positively influence all areas of a child's growth and development. Thus, it is important to invest in efforts to increase quality, including providing professional development to enhance the skills of those caring for children in their homes. This study explores the characteristics of FCC providers who engage in an online professional development program. Findings show that a majority of these providers are female, had at least a high school diploma, and are licensed or registered. Content areas most frequently selected for professional development include ways to support children's social, emotional, physical, and intellectual development. The frequency of access and range of coursework completed implies that online learning is accessible for the FCC workforce audience and has the capacity to meet state requirements for professional development. Future directions to extend this research are discussed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "This faculty development case study focuses on a team of 16 General Education faculty at an urban women's college during the initial 6 months of the college's comprehensive implementation of an iPad teaching and learning environment. This article traces the effectiveness of an iPad professional development program through analyses of critical feedback, and makes recommendations for learner-centered faculty development for iPads in Higher Education. We present our conceptual framework, guiding principles and iPad professional development program. The effects of the program were measured using thematic and content analysis of post-session interviews, participant observation, one-to-one interviews and an online discussion forum. The predominant themes were anxiety, having individual needs considered, time considerations, and fundamental questions about expectations in the mobile learning environment. The key recommendation are to attend to collaborative planning, intervention, facilitating authentic professional learning communities and timing of faculty development that is intended to result in integration of new learning tools and environments.

        "This paper examines the development of data infrastructure in Australian schooling with a specific focus on interoperability standards that help to make new markets for education data. The conceptual framework combines insights from studies of infrastructure, economic markets and digital data. The case of the Australian National Schools Interoperability Program is analysed, drawing on a corpus of web-based technical and promotional documents and supporting interviews. The paper shows that Australia has well-developed data infrastructure in schooling that is creating new relations between schools, school systems and commercial vendors within network markets for data-driven educational technologies.

        "The field of K-12 education is being transformed, with an influx of students, including those with identified disabilities, engaging in blended and fully online learning. While online learning shows promise for students with disabilities through flexible content and personalised instruction, concerns regarding accessibility and appropriateness of online learning for this population still exist. In order to examine this concern, researchers developed and used a Universal Design for Learning (UDL) Scan Tool to measure lesson content and alignment with UDL principles, guidelines and checkpoints. Four hundred and seventy-eight math, science and world history Khan Academy lessons were randomly selected and evaluated for this study.

        "Research into educational technology has evaluated new computer-based systems as tools for improving students' academic performance and engagement. Serious games should also be considered as an alternative pedagogical medium for attracting students with different needs and expectations. In this field study, we empirically examined different forms of serious-game use for learning on learning performance and attitudes of eighty 13-year-old students in the first grade of middle school. Divided into four groups of 20 students, each group practiced with a maths video game in three ways. The first group played the storytelling maths game, the second played the same game but with no story and the third played and modified the video game. Finally, a control group practised in a paper-based (traditional) way by solving exercises. Although only minor differences in learning performance were identified, we found significant differences in the attitudes of the students toward learning through the video game. Students who are not motivated by conventional paper-based assignments might be engaged better with the use of a video game. Our findings suggest that video game pedagogy could provide malleable learning for different groups of students using methods that move beyond the conventional tool-based approach.

        "This paper presents four projects in which mobile devices are used to support authentic learning in an afterschool technology club,La Clase Mágica(LCM@UTSA), designed to motivate underrepresented elementary school children in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. The implementation of mobile devices into our LCM@UTSA is based on a sociocultural approach to mobile learning in which we use mobile devices to bridge school and home lives in order to make learning authentic and meaningful. This approach uses mobile devices to facilitate generative themes, and multiple contexts. This paper describes four tablet-based projects in LCM@UTSA since 2012, which follow this sociocultural approach to mobile learning. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "Our work is within the context of the ubiquitous discussion about adopting mobile devices to offer school-age students new learner-centric learning opportunities. Leveraging location-based context-aware mobile technology, based on the theoretical foundation of constructivist learning, we have developedEduVenture, an integrated mobile learning system by which teachers can facilitate students pursuing outdoor social inquiry learning in social and humanities education (namely,Liberal Studiesin Hong Kong). This paper reports on our study in which we investigated 302 in-service Liberal Studies teachers’ concerns about adopting EduVenture in practice with theStages of Concernmodel, in terms of five categorical concerns –Evaluation,Information,Management,Consequence, andRefocusing. Results reveal that their Management concern was the most intense. The findings not only offer us critical insights into formulating more articulated interventions for better supporting teachers’ adoption of EduVenture in schools, but they also provide a useful reference for researchers and practitioners who are pursuing work on integrating mobile learning into school education.

        "English as a foreign language (EFL) learners in China view learning vocabulary as one of their biggest challenges. Despite the importance of vocabulary learning for mastering English, no existing survey specifically measures Chinese students' vocabulary learning motivation. This study aimed to cross-culturally adapt the Vocabulary Learning Motivation Questionnaire (VLMQ; Tanaka, 2017) and validated it in a Chinese context. Both within- and between-network approaches were used. Results indicated the applicability of this new version of the scale (i.e., VLMQ-Chinese) in measuring the vocabulary learning motivation of Chinese high school students. Results of the within-network analyses supported the four-factor model of the scale which includes intrinsic, identified, introjected, and external motivation. Measurement invariance across gender was also supported. The between-network analyses indicated that different types of motivation were associated with students' vocabulary proficiency, self-efficacy, and self-regulating capacity in vocabulary learning. Among the different types of motivation, intrinsic motivation and identified motivation were more strongly associated with adaptive learning-related outcomes. Theoretically, this study extends the past vocabulary learning literature by focusing specifically on Chinese EFL learners' vocabulary learning motivation. Practically, this study provides researchers and educators with a tool to measure students' motivation in vocabulary learning. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "The use of online learning and other software-powered technologies is on the rise in the United States, encouraged financially and politically by governmental and commercial entities. Specifically, online courses are gaining ground in K–12 public schools, schools which often purchase from third-party providers. After a decade in the New York City Department of Education as an English teacher and schools official responsible for a large-scale online learning programme, the author asks the question: How does the use of software-powered technologies like online learning affect the teaching of literature? In pursuit of this question, the author draws on concept from the field of software studies while adapting qualitative methods from multimodal studies to examine precisely how the nature of software (and the ideologies of those who create and sell it) are subtly influencing the teaching of literature.

        "In this study, a problem-posing strategy is proposed for supporting collaborative mobile learning activities. Accordingly, a mobile learning environment has been developed, and an experiment on a local culture course has been conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Three classes of an elementary school in southern Taiwan participated in the experiment. One class was the experimental group who learned with the problem-posing-based mobile learning approach, while the other two classes were the control groups who learned with the conventional mobile learning approach and the traditional problem-posing approach, respectively. The experimental results show that the new approach not only improved the students' learning achievement, but also promoted their local culture identity and group learning self-efficacy.

        "Well-designed game-based learning can provide students with an innovative environment that may enhance students' motivation and engagement in learning and thus improve their learning performance. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationships among elementary school students' flow experience and learning performances. We also investigated the gender and grade differences as well as the types of potential clusters of flow experiences and performance. Thirty-four elementary school students participated in this study. This study conducted correction analysis, difference analysis and a two-stage cluster analysis. The findings suggested that the students with higher flow experiences tended to have higher learning performances. The results of gender differences showed that female students had high performance scores and great flow experiences in the mini-educational game in this study. Moreover, the results revealed that the students of higher grade had significantly higher scores in both performance and flow experience than the students of lower grade. The result of cluster analysis fell into three categories: low performance/low flow experience students, high flow experience students and high performance/high flow experience students. On the basis of our findings, we also proposed suggestions for future game-based learning research. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "We live in a designed world. STEAM by Design presents a transdisciplinary approach to learning that challenges young minds with the task of making a better world. Learning today, like life, is dynamic, connected and engaging. STEAM (Science, Technology, Environment, Engineering, Art, and Math) teaching and learning integrates information in place-based projects accessing everyday technology of virtual field trips, digital interactives, apps, and contemporary art, science and design practices. STEAM by Design develops designing minds. Designing minds work across STEAM fields developing social, cultural, technological, environmental and economical responses to existing and future conditions. Design adds Art and the environment to the STEM equation to contribute site specific, culturally connected, contributions to creative economies. Documented case studies at the elementary, middle and high school level demonstrate the ease of delivering STEAM by Design opportunities and reveal the inherent creativity of students if encouraged. Design cultivates new knowledge, skills and values derived from becoming aware, developing understanding, and testing ideas through making. Designing place-based projects, K-16 students acquire STEAM aptitude and better understand the use of STEM fields in solving contemporary problems. Access to everyday technologies cultivate ways to create, communicate and collaborate. STEAM by Design is supported by the ELearning Designopedia, NEXT.cc, aligned with newly released NEXT Generation Science Standards, North American Association for Environmental Education Standards and Art and Design Standards. STEAM by Design positions designing as world pedagogy that connects students as citizen activists in the communities in which they live and learn. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "Education in the 21st century demands a model for understanding a new culture of learning in the face of rapid change, open access data and geographical diversity. Teachers no longer need to provide the latest information because students themselves are taking an active role in peer collectives to help create it. This paper examines, through an Australian case study entitled 'Design Minds', the development of an online design education platform as a key initiative to enact a government priority for statewide cultural change through design-based curriculum. Utilising digital technology to create a supportive community, 'Design Minds' recognises that interdisciplinary learning fostered through engagement will empower future citizens to think, innovate, and discover. This paper details the participatory design process undertaken with multiple stakeholders to create the platform. It also outlines a proposed research agenda for future measurement of its value in creating a new learning culture, supporting regional and remote communities, and revitalising frontline services. It is anticipated this research will inform ongoing development of the online platform, and future design education and research programs in K-12 schools in Australia. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "This study reports on self-regulated learning ( SRL) of Chinese distance learners by using a structured SRL scale. SRL of adult and lifelong learners is a well-researched area, though its application within distance education is a new area of investigation. Open and distance learning lean heavily on self-learning and self-learning resources, though interaction at designated learning centers and online learning platforms is occasionally offered. In China, there is still persistence of the age-old teacher-centric model of teaching-learning; and, within distance education offered largely by the radio and television universities, there is insistence for regular tuition classes at designated branch schools. At the backdrop of understanding and enhancing SRL of Chinese distance learners, the authors took up this research to find out the elements and levels of SRL ability among Chinese distance learners. Based on factor analysis (on 357 students for item analysis and on 600 distance learners for structural validity of the initial 117-item scale), a standardized 54-item Self-regulated Learning Ability Scale was finalized and administered on a random sample of 2738 undergraduate learners (1630 males and 1108 females) from the Open Distance Education Centre of Beijing Normal University, P. R. China, doing an online course during 2009-10. The sample came from either senior high school (grade 12) or junior college (grade 14). Data on four dimensions of SRL-planning, control, regulating and evaluation-were analyzed using ' t' test for variables of gender, level of education and age. Results indicated that all the participants had above-average levels of SRL in all the four dimensions of planning, control, regulating and evaluation. In so far as gender was concerned, male distance learners were better in SRL than female distance learners, especially in control (ie, content and resources) and all the evaluation dimensions. Though no age difference was found, students from junior colleges had better planning, regulating and evaluating abilities than those who came from senior high schools. These results have been discussed in the context of current changes in Chinese distance/online education and also in relation to the age-old Chinese culture of learning. The results will also have implications for designing distance and online learning generally. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "Background: Previous studies have argued that technology can be a major support to the music teacher enabling, amongst other things, increased student motivation, higher levels of confidence and more individualised learning to take place [Bolton, J. 2008. Technologically mediated composition learning: Josh’s story. British Journal of Music Education 25, no. 1: 41–55; Kardos, L. 2012. How music technology can make sound and music worlds accessible to student composers in further education colleges. British Journal of Music Education 29, no. 2: 143–51]. In contrast, a reasonable number of alternative voices [Conlon, T. and Simpson, M. 2003. Silicon Valley versus Silicon Glen: The impact of computers upon teaching and learning: A comparative study. British Journal of Educational Technology 34, no. 2: 137–50; Convery, A. 2009. The pedagogy of the impressed: How teachers become victims of technological vision. Teachers and Teaching 15, no. 1: 25–41; Treadway, M. 2001. Making a difference? An investigation into the relationship between ICT use and standards in secondary schools. Cowbridge: Fischer Family Trust] have also argued against the claims made for the effectiveness of technology in enhancing the learning process. More specifically, recent work by Armstrong [Armstrong, V. 2008. Hard bargaining on the hard drive: Gender bias in the music technology classroom. Gender and Education 20, no. 4: 375–86; Armstrong, V. 2011. Technology and the gendering of music education. Aldershot: Ashgate] has explored issues of technology and music education in relation to gender, suggesting that the construction of gendered meanings associated with digital technologies is having a major effect on pupils’ attitudes and thus ultimately, on their level of achievement in areas such as musical composition. However, there is relatively little research on how primary-aged boys and girls relate to technology as a composing tool and how they experience this compared with using more traditional instruments to compose. More specifically, very little research has been carried out into the extent to which boys and girls differ in their attitudes towards using technology as a composing tool. Purpose: This small-scale, exploratory study had two main aims. The first aim was to investigate whether any gender differences existed between the attitudes of boys and girls towards the use of computers in creating musical compositions. The second aim was to compare their attitudes between composing with instruments and composing with computers. Sample:Our study was based in England and involved class groups of 10–11-year-old pupils in three state primary schools; a total of 63 children were involved in creating short musical compositions over a two-week period. Forty-three of them were interviewed about their experiences. Methods:Our method involved children composing two pieces of music on the same theme. In the first lesson, they composed a piece using a musical notation software package on a computer whilst in the second lesson they composed a piece on the same theme using percussion instruments. Forty-three children (22 pairs of children) were subsequently interviewed about their attitudes towards composing with computers and with percussion instruments. Findings and discussion:Our findings suggested that children could appreciate both the advantages and disadvantages of using computers to compose musical pieces and a number of differences existed between boys and girls in terms of their attitudes and the way in which they composed their pieces. The findings also suggested that differences might exist in the way in which boys and girls integrated previous musical knowledge, skill and teaching into the compositional process as well as affecting their levels of motivation, confidence and self-esteem in gender-specific ways. Conclusions:This small and exploratory study suggests that variations do exist in children’s approaches to computer-based musical composition activities and that attitudes do appear to vary as a function of gender.

        "In recent years information technology has been integrated into education to produce a series of trends, beginning with “electronic learning” (e-learning), through “mobile learning” (m-learning) and finally to “ubiquitous learning” (u-learning), which aims to improve learner motivation through overcoming the conventional limitations of time and location. U-learning practices are still being developed, and learners frequently experience difficulty focusing on learning objectives, and effective learning strategy tools are still lacking. This study reports the design of a context-aware astronomy learning system. The system integrates several technologies, including radio frequency identification, wireless communication networks, handheld mobile devices, and databases to help students learn astronomical concepts. Two content modules were developed in the context of natural science education for fifth-grade elementary school students in Taiwan. Indicators of user experience with the system were collected for further phenomenographic analysis, based on four perspectives of the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology model to assess learner willingness to use this novel u-learning approach. Results show that ease-of-use and the availability of immediate operational or technical support are key factors in increasing learning motivation and performance. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "Researchers have offered, in recent years, compelling reasons for considering the potential of digital games to support learning and in response policy-makers and educators around the world have demonstrated a commitment to exploring their practical use in school. There remain, however, many questions about how games can best support learning, particularly in formal education. This paper examines the implications of formal game-based learning for teachers developing their own digital learning games, exploring two guiding overarching research questions. What strategies are employed by teachers to manage intergenerational, technological, operational and pedagogic tensions in the classroom? And to what extent is the notion of being a “designer” visible in their professional practice? The paper suggests that there are multiple ways of “being a designer” for teachers, and that the notion of “designer” may be a more problematic representation of teacher agency and identity than currently visible in the literature.

        "Teachers who attempt pedagogical innovation with authentic digital games face significant challenges because such games instantiate open systems of learner activity, inviting enquiry learning rather than knowledge acquisition. However, school environments are normatively sanctioned cultural spaces where direct instruction and high-stakes tests arede riguer. In this paper, we draw on the conceptual frame of dilemmatic spaces to illuminate the dilemmas teachers encounter when attempting to reconstruct professional practice in the classroom. We worked with nine teachers who enacted theStatecraft Xsocial studies curriculum. Drawing on coded interview data, our findings suggest that teachers are forced to wrestle with tensions engendered by misalignments that emerge from the innovation's tacit requirement for change and the system's inherent gravitation towards maintaining thestatus quo. A school culture that cultivates innovative practice based on greater teacher agency is needed for authentic game-based learning to find traction in the classroom. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "In recent decades, digitization, digital technology and the expansion of the Internet have resulted in significant changes in media ecology. Important consequences of these developments concern the socialization of new generations, where the values, skills and identities of young people are shaped through their participation in a range of online activities. One important consequence of the use of Internet and digital resources is that academic learning no longer is restricted to the school. Neither does it mainly imply being able to reproduce what is already known. The focus of this special issue section is on research on alternative settings for learning where digital technology plays a significant role and where it co-constitutes the activities of learners in significant manners.

        "Self-efficacy is an important motivational construct for primary school teachers (teachers of children aged 5–12 years) within Australia. Teacher self-efficacy beliefs will determine the level of teacher confidence and competence to engage with a task. In this study, we explore engagement with digital technology and the associated learning and teaching of digital technology. Exploring the teacher self-efficacy beliefs towards technology of pre-service teachers, this study surveyed pre-service teachers studying to become primary teachers in two states within Australia (Victoria and Queensland). Findings are important as they provide insights into current levels of perceived competence and confidence towards engaging with digital technology as a future teacher. Findings highlight vast difference across a variety of teacher skills and actions. Given that beliefs are resistant to change after the beginning phase of teaching, it is important to understand the current beliefs of pre-service teachers who will soon be present in Australian classrooms.

        "• Apple Teacher users are both producers and consumers of content, or prosumers. • Apple leveraging the need for remote learning during COVID school disruptions. • Apple Teacher repositions Apple as a global education authority and expert. Although COVID-19 has intensified clear global trends towards the digitalisation of schooling and the increasing role of information technology in education, a less obvious consequence has been the shift to online professional learning for teachers themselves. Informed by an emerging critical literature of digital education platforms, this paper will explore how Apple Teacher – the digital learning platform of the US technology giant, Apple Inc. – forges new marketised and platformed relations between schooling spaces and actors. I argue that Apple Teacher helps Apple to maximise its policy relevance, allowing it to leverage its global brand recognition to compellingly promote a particular vision of teacher knowledge and expertise.

        "This study presents the development process of a new model of educational innovation, that involves the use of digital technologies. The model is based on a broad theoretical framework together with research involving this long-term case study. The backbone of the model consists of a fundamental revision of a multi-level Organizational Learning Framework incorporating the influence of the external school context (outside of the school context) and various aspects of leadership. The conceptual model not only clarifies the learning capacity of the teachers and administration, in accordance with the organizational learning approach, but can also be used as a tool for the investigation of planned interventions in line with the 'learning school' conception. The incorporation of the concept of leadership practice strengthens the original Organizational Learning Framework on all levels in the school organization. The conceptual model integrates and improves theoretical frameworks for context-conscious leadership, organizational learning and distributed leadership. An important outcome of this study is an increased understanding of the relation between distributed leadership and collective sense-making as an important prerequisite for the incorporation of digital learning materials in teaching practice.

        "By gradually placing more importance on game-based education and changing learning motivation by applying game-playing characteristics, students’ learning experiences can be enhanced and a better learning effect can be achieved. When teaching the content of Chinese poetry in Taiwanese junior high schools, most teachers only explain the meaning of Chinese poetry, while it is difficult for students to understand why poets write these poems, resulting in learning confusion. This paper implemented a digital game-based situated learning system based on Tang Dynasty poems for learning Chinese poetry to simulate the situations of hardship encountered by poets when writing poetry in animated form to help junior high school students in Taiwan to have greater understanding when learning the content of Chinese poetry. The research results show that students who used the Gourd Tang Dynasty system in game-based instruction had significantly better learning achievements than students who underwent traditional narrative instruction. Among them, students in the low learning ability group improved in their grades significantly more than students in the high learning ability group in terms of their Tang Dynasty poetry learning. Furthermore, the authors examined the predictive relationships between perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness and behavioural intention related to the digital game-based situated learning system for Chinese language poetry. The factor of perceived usefulness was a key factor in the students’ positive attitudes towards the digital game-based situated learning system. There were no significant differences with respect to individual characteristics (i.e. gender, online game experience and digital learning experience). The results demonstrate that this type of system can be widely accepted by students with different learning experiences. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "This article examines the supporting and constraining factors influencing professional learning about interactive teaching and mobile digital technology use in low-resourced basic schools in sub-Saharan Africa. It draws on a case study of iterative development and refinement of a school-based, peer-facilitated professional learning programme (‘OER4Schools’) that integrated use of mobile technologies, digital open educational resources and interactive pedagogy. The research and development involved teachers in three Zambian primary schools and culminated in an extensive multimedia resource. Using an ecological framework, factors emerging were characterised at three levels: teacher, school, and the wider community and policy context. They include school organisation and leadership, teacher motivation and perceptions of opportunities for professional learning and change, teacher views of pupil capabilities, availability of resources, teacher collaboration, and viewpoints of parents and policymakers.

        "This study utilized a tool-oriented perspective on the uptake and use of digital technology in three exemplary upper secondary schools, to determine how the school leaders viewed leadership in the development of information and communication technology (ICT)-enriched environments for teaching and learning, and how they utilized technology in their daily leadership practices. The data were obtained from interviews with the school leaders and analyses of school documents and websites. In all three schools, leadership was extended and distributed beyond the work of the principal, taking into account the shared and professional expertise in the leader group and across the staff, and relying on reliable technologies and systemic activities developed over time. The findings confirm previous research underlining the importance of supportive school leadership for the successful implementation of ICT in education. In addition, the study shows that in schools oriented towards Web 2.0 or open collaborative technology practices, the leadership functions as a team-based and distributed activity, relying on educational and technological expertise at multiple levels. The findings across the three schools suggest that tool-mediated activities may become routinized over time, transforming into unspoken institutional infrastructures. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "To mark the 40th Anniversary of Medical Teacher, issues this year will document changes in medical education that have taken place over the past 40 years in undergraduate, postgraduate and continuing education with regard to curriculum themes and approaches, teaching and learning methods, assessment techniques and management issues. Trends such as adaptive learning will be highlighted and one issue will look at the medical school of the future. An analysis of papers published in the journal has identified four general trends in medical education - increased collaboration, greater international interest, student engagement with the education process and a move to a more evidence-informed approach to medical education. These changes over the years have been dramatic. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "While the potential benefits of participating in online learning communities are documented, so too are inequities in terms of how different populations access and use them. We present the online learning support roles (OLSR) framework, an approach using both automated analytics and qualitative interpretation to identify and explore online teaching roles. We analyze the OLSR using data logs ofiRemix, the online component of theDigital Youth Network, a face-to-face and online program for urban youth in underserved communities. In three middle-school classrooms, six educators usediRemixmost to interact with individual students, especially as a window into their work. Although many roles were documented, few were played regularly, raising questions about design and intentionality. To address participation inequities, our results suggest that the OLSR and related data can be used to support productive practice improvement conversations among educators and to inform the design of online social learning networks.

        "Technology makes possible abundant new opportunities to capture and display data in online learning environments. We describe here an example of using these opportunities to improve students' use of the rich supports available in online learning environments. We describe an example of a blended learning experience that uses an online inquiry-based middle-school science curriculum in which we provided sixth graders ( n = 126) data aligned with the Universal Design for Learning instructional framework. Students were provided and asked to reflect on their own data not only about performance but also about use of optional embedded supports vis-à-vis their perceptions of difficulty of key concepts. We determined that students were generally able to understand and interpret these rich data and that providing these data influenced subsequent help seeking in the online environment. We discuss implications for supporting help seeking and designing assessment and feedback within online learning environments. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "Translation instruction is very important in specialized English teaching activities. The effectiveness of current specialized English translation instruction (SETI) in mainland China, however, is unclear because university students have become less interested in, and less confident when doing, English translation. This study investigated the effects of online cooperative translation on EFL students’ levels of interest and self-efficacy with respect to specialized English translation through a questionnaire, focus group interview, interaction data analysis, and pre-test and post-test on 48 second-year college students in China majoring in educational technology. The results showed that online cooperative translations could significantly increase student interest and self-efficacy in specialized English translation. In cooperative translation, student engagement was significantly and linearly correlated with their interest and self-efficacy in translation. We conclude with recommendations on reforming current SETI practices in mainland China's universities. [ABSTRACT FROM PUBLISHER]",

        "The aim of this paper is to examine the effects of sequencing instructional materials and learners' prior knowledge on learning ESL (English as a second language) through an online learning course. 121 fifth-grade students from an elementary school in Korea participated in the study. Each participant was allocated to one cell of a 2 × 2 between-subjects factorial design, with an instructional format (i.e. sequential or concurrent) as a first factor, and prior knowledge (i.e. high or low) as a second factor. Instructions of the words and grammar rules were allocated to each page for the sequential group, whereas integrated on a single page for the concurrent group. The result indicates that the sequential instruction of words followed by grammar explanations was more effective for the students with higher levels of prior knowledge than the concurrent presentation. The reverse was also found for the students with lower levels of prior knowledge in English. There are four possible explanations for the results. First, split-attention effect, temporal-contiguity effect, or transient information effect might occur. Second, worked-example effect might occur and over-ride the effect of sequencing. Third, intrinsic and extraneous cognitive load might intertwine each other. Last, the levels of element interactivity in two instructional formats might be different from each other. The implications for instructional designers and future research are discussed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "Over the last few years, the use of mobile technologies has brought the formulation of location-based learning approaches shaping new or enhanced educational activities. Involving teachers in the design of these activities is important because the designs need to be aligned with the requirements of the specific educational settings. Yet analysing the implementation of the activities with students is also critical, not only for assessment purposes but also for enabling the identification of learning design elements that should be revised and improved. This paper studies a case that applies visualizations to support students' self-assessment and teachers' inquiry of a mobile learning design. The design is a gamified location-based learning activity composed by geolocated questions and implemented with the 'QuesTInSitu: The Game' mobile application. The activity was designed by seven teachers and enacted by 81 secondary education students organized in a total of 23 groups. Log files, gathered from 'QuesTInSitu: The Game,' provided the data for the visualizations, which represented relevant aspects of the group activity enactment (both time used to answer questions and to reach the geographical zone of the questions, scores obtained per zone, etc). On the one hand, the visualizations were discussed with the teachers as a learning analytics tool potentially useful to consider when redesigning the activity, if needed. On the other hand, the study shows that the visualizations led students to make a better diagnosis of their own activity performance. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "As higher education expands online course offerings, it is essential that sexuality educators strive to translate success from in-person courses into online pedagogy. While many educators remain anxious about, or sceptical of, the benefits of online sexuality education, the popularity of online courses demands engagement if educators are not to miss out on the opportunity to educate growing numbers and different types of students. Building on the authors' previous work addressing foundational best practices for online sexuality education at college and university level, this paper focuses specifically on translating successes from in-person classrooms to the online learning environment. Through consideration of core learning objectives and commonly available learning technologies, it identifies five popular in-person teaching methods (brainstorming, forced choice, demonstration, films and videos, and role play) and explains how these can be successfully translated into online learning environments. Each of the five areas includes a rationale for use, considerations and strategies for successful implementation, and a specific example of translating a traditional sexuality education activity to an online learning environment.

        "There is considerable enthusiasm in many quarters for the incorporation of digital games into the classroom, and the capacity of games to engage and challenge players, present complex representations and experiences, foster collaborative learning, and promote deep learning. But while there is increasing research documenting the progress and outcomes of game-based learning, relatively little attention is paid to student perceptions and voice. In order to effectively target game-based learning pedagogy, it is important to understand students' previous experience, if any, of the use of games in the classroom, and what they made of these. In this paper, we present findings from a survey of 270 primary and secondary school students in Year Levels 4–9 (aged 9–14) in 6 Queensland schools at the start of a 3-year Australian Research Council project researching the use of digital games in school to promote literacy and learning.

        "From the contexts of current social, educational and health policy, there appears to be an increasingly inevitable 'mobilisation' of resources in medicine and health as the use mobile technology devices and applications becomes widespread and culturally 'normed' in workplaces. Over the past 8 years, students from the University of Leeds Medical School have been loaned mobile devices and smartphones and been given access to mobile-based resources to assist them with learning and assessments as part of clinical activity in placement settings. Our experiences lead us to suggest that educators should be focusing less on whether mobile learning should be implemented and more on developing mobile learning in curricula that is comprehensive, sustainable, meaningful and compulsory, in order to prepare students for accessing and using such resources in their working lives.

        "Multimedia literacy practices in the homes of young children are changing rapidly, but the use of them in the early years of education is moving slowly. This research was aimed to find out what teachers of 5-year-olds, in their first 6 months of compulsory schooling, think about the children's literacy practices at home, including the perceived use of digital media at home. We also wanted to find out what the teachers did in their classrooms that was similar or different to the students' experiences of literacy practices across several media. Parents of 76 children, and their teachers, from 10 classrooms in mid-high and mid-low socio-economic areas completed surveys. The parents' survey asked about the literacy-related experiences their children are involved in. The teachers' survey asked for their beliefs about the literacy-related experiences the children in their classrooms engaged in, on average, including the use of digital media. The teachers were also asked about the literacy practices in their classroom and their use of media. This paper describes the teachers' beliefs and the similarities and differences in practices between home and school, including literacy practices using digital technology. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "How to close the achievement gap in the classroom so that no student is left behind becomes one of the most important issues nowadays. This study aims to construct a collaborative and competitive game-based learning environment to improve English proficiencies and reduce the achievement gap for disadvantaged students. The Wireless Crossword Fan-Tan Game (WiCFG) system was implemented to provide teachers with an innovative approach to guide students’ learning through a positive involvement with the uses of tablet PCs. The experiment was conducted in an elementary school in Taiwan to investigate whether this approach would facilitate students’ learning effectiveness and interactions. Thirty sixth-grade students were randomly assigned into a control group and an experimental group. Both qualitative and quantitative data were collected from surveys, interviews, observations and video-recordings. The results indicate that integration of the WiCFG system in the collaborative and competitive game-based learning environment leads students to a better interaction between different levels of students. This innovative approach might have the potential to close the achievement gap for disadvantaged students. Moreover, some principles of the classroom strategy are suggested as guidelines.

        "This paper describes a dataset with data from three individually randomized educational technology experiments on differentiation, formative testing and feedback during one school year for a group of 8th grade students in the Netherlands, using administrative data and the online motivation questionnaire of Boekaerts. The dataset consists of pre- and posttest scores for each experiment, as well as background information on the students, such as gender, age, ability, grade repetition and neighborhood characteristics. It also includes motivation of students. The dataset, or parts of it, could be interesting to use in future studies, focusing on effects of the use of educational technology, for comparison with similar and/or slightly different experiments, and for studies such as meta-analyses or replication studies, especially given the individual experimental setup.

        "Vocational education taking place in the dual contexts of workplace and school often lacks integration of concrete experiences with theoretical knowledge. The interplay between workplace and school contexts and their often antagonistic priorities call for a specific model that transforms these divergences into learning opportunities and connects different forms of knowledge into an integrated body of knowledge that contributes to developing vocational competence. This paper presents a multidimensional pedagogical model, called the ‘Erfahrraum’, for the design and implementation of educational technologies as a way to foster this integration in initial dual vocational education and training (VET). The ‘Erfahrraum’ model informs the design of shared spaces for capturing and reflecting on experiences made in different contexts in which VET takes place. The model particularly emphasises the importance of shared reflection processes to turn concrete experiences into relevant integrated knowledge. Examples of implementations in different professions using a range of different technologies illustrate the power of the ‘Erfahrraum’ model. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "Mobile learning technologies are being introduced and adopted by an increasing number of medical schools. Following the implementation of these devices, institutions are tasked with the challenge of their integration into curriculum delivery and presented with the opportunity to facilitate data collection from large student cohorts. Since 2011, Manchester Medical School (MMS) has undertaken the largest deployment of iPads within UK Higher Education. Working towards the more efficient collation of students' compulsory workplace-based assessment data led us to evaluate how existing information management software could replace previously paper-based systems. Following an evaluation of six, and a trial of one, commercially available packages, the existing software solutions were found to be inflexible and unfit for purpose. This resulted in the development of a new digital solution that addressed the limitations of the previous system. 'University of Manchester (UoM) eForms' consists of an app and a web-based administration system that respectively permit high volume data collection and management. UoM eForms has now replaced the preceding paper-based and electronic systems within MMS for workplace-based assessment administration, due to the improved usability and dynamicity built into its interface and infrastructure. This new system has found many further useful applications, including research data collection, feedback, placement evaluations, quality assurance and interview marking. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "VISOLE (Virtual Interactive Student-Oriented Environment) is a teacher-facilitated pedagogical approach to integrating constructivist online game-based learning into formal curriculum teaching in school education. This paper reports a case study on the implementation of VISOLE in secondary Geography education. We compared the pedagogical effectiveness of VISOLE and the traditional classroom teaching approach, in terms of students' knowledge acquisition with respect to a formal curriculum. One hundred and ninety-eight students from top, middle, and bottom academic-banding schools were selected and divided into three experimental groups and three control groups to participate in the research. Results showed that, in comparison with the traditional approach, VISOLE had a positive pedagogical effect on both low and moderate academic-achievement students, but not on high academic-achievement students. The findings shed light on enhancing the existing design of VISOLE, and provide researchers and educators with new insights into harnessing online games in formal school education in practice.

        "Marine education comprises rich and multifaceted issues. Raising general awareness of marine environments and issues demands the development of new learning materials. This study adapts concepts from digital game-based learning to design an innovative marine learning program integrating augmented reality (AR) technology for lower grade primary school students. The proposed activity integrates physical and virtual learning materials, encouraging students to engage in an interactive learning environment that makes learning fun and interesting. The program introduces Taiwan’s marine ecology and water resources. To assess learners’ engagement, a quasi-experimental research design was used, where the participant pool consisted of 51 primary school students in Taiwan. Results indicate that (1) students were highly confident by the learning activities and viewed them satisfactorily, (2) students acquired the target knowledge, and (3) the innovative learning program specifically helps low academic achievers improve learning performance.

        "This study is to investigate the effectiveness of using mobile devices such as iPhone/iPad/android phone/tablet to facilitate mobile learning in aural skills. The application Auralbook was designed in 2011 by an engineer/musician to use mobile devices to learn aural skills. This application enables students to sing, record, clap and answer questions generated by the computer based on the Associated Board of Royal Schools of Music (ABRSM) syllabus for more than 100,000 users worldwide. This study is to a) examine the effectiveness of using application Auralbook to learn aural skills, b) observe the progress of learning during the aural musicianship development, and c) propose a theoretical framework in using mobile devices to learn aural skills. The performance scores in each area, such as clapping, singing, feature (stylistic recognition), are analyzed. Research findings indicate that the functions clapping and singing score better than the other function – feature (stylistic recognition). The frequent users show significant progress in clapping and feature (stylistic recognition) at the beginner level, and singing at the intermediate level in this study. [ABSTRACT FROM PUBLISHER]",

        "In recent years, the use of mobile technologies has increased in a number of fields such as banking, economy, tourism, entertainment, library research, etc. These developments have also led to the use of mobile technologies for educational purposes. The successful integration of mobile learning (m-learning) technologies in education primarily demands that teachers' and students' adequacy and perceptions of such technology should be determined. Therefore, the aim of this study was to compare teachers' and students' abilities and perceptions concerning m-learning. Research data for the analysis were obtained from a sample of 467 teachers and 1556 students from 32 schools that were surveyed in Northern Cyprus. Based on our results, we conclude that teachers and students want to use m-learning in education. Their perceptions are positive but their m-learning adequacy levels are not sufficient.

        "Traditional, top-down professional development (PD) can render teachers mere implementers of the ideas of others, but there is some hope that the participatory nature of social media such as Twitter might support more grassroots PD. To better understand Twitter’s role in education, we conducted a survey of K–16 educators regarding their use of the microblogging service for professional purposes. Respondents described multifaceted and intense use, with PD activities more common than use with students and families. This paper delves into qualitative data from 494 respondents who described their perspectives on Twitter PD. Educators praised the platform as efficient, accessible and interactive. Twitter was credited with providing opportunities to access novel ideas and stay abreast of education advances and trends, particularly regarding educational technology. Numerous respondents compared Twitter favorably with other PD available to them. Members of our sample also appreciated how Twitter connected them to educators beyond their own schools and districts, with mention of exposure to both like-minded and diverse perspectives. Respondents described positive and collaborative professional activity facilitated by Twitter, and many noted how it helped them combat various forms of isolation. We conclude by discussing implications of the survey results for educators, researchers and policy-makers. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "This research investigates the effective use of Digital Work Environment (DWE) in France. A theoretical framework based on the pedagogical engineering approach is used to propose an hypothetical model, which results in an explained variable of intention for the pedagogical use of an educational technology. The sex, the teaching disciplines, the use of computers at home and the technical skills are the exogenous variables in this hypothetical model in order to measure the degree of significance of these variables on the intention of integration Digital Work Environment (DWE) in schools. A survey research design was adopted to collect the data on the DWE Scolastance usage from the Academy of Strasbourg Institution. Descriptive statistics and ANOVA were used to measure the difference among the groups. A structural equation modeling approach was used to test and validate the proposed model. The results tend to demonstrate that the DWE is perceived primarily as a 'communication tool' or as a means to achieve the prescribed uses by the academic institutions. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "Online language learning is challenging to young learners who often need high levels of support from teachers and parents due to their limited skills in self-regulated learning. While technology integration in education is on the rise, there continues to be a lack of research into how young learners can be better supported in online language learning. This qualitative study examines how parents support young learners' online learning of English during the COVID-19 pandemic, based on interviews with 30 parents of students in Grades 1–5 at a Chinese primary school. The study reveals a range of supportive practices: monitoring of learning emerged as the top priority for parents, followed by affective, academic and technology support. Most of these parental support strategies were mediated primarily by the children's grade level and/or parents' socioeconomic background. Parents also sought teachers' help and played bridging roles to enable teacher-student interaction, particularly when they were unable to provide direct help themselves. Based on these findings, we proposed a tripartite model of parental support for young learners' online learning of English to include interactions between parents, young learners, and teachers, which may inform research and practice of young learners' online language learning.

        "Concept maps have been recognized as an effective tool for students to organize their knowledge; however, in history courses, it is important for students to learn and organize historical events according to the time of their occurrence. Therefore, in this study, a time sequence-oriented concept map approach is proposed for developing a game-based environment to facilitate students' learning of historical events and their organization during the gaming process. With this approach, students can easily learn the precedence relationships among the historical events that occurred in different time periods with the time sequence-oriented concept map. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, a historical role-playing game has been developed for an elementary school history course to examine the students' performance in terms of learning motivation, self-efficacy and learning achievements. A subject unit, the “Siege of Fort Zeelandia by Zheng Cheng-Gong,” was chosen as the history topic. The results show that the proposed approach can significantly enhance the students' learning achievement, but did not affect their learning motivation or self-efficacy for the history course. As a consequence, it is concluded that students can benefit from concept maps in terms of enhancing their learning achievement, but they do not necessarily enjoy using concept maps in game-based learning activities.

        "Teaching internships constitute a core part of teacher education. However, it is unclear how internship experiences can be enhanced with digital technologies to foster teacher professional development. In two experimental studies, we examined the relationship between internship experiences, the development of teaching enthusiasm and teacher self-efficacy when using a mobile portfolio app during teaching internships. Results show a positive effect of internship experiences on teaching enthusiasm and self-efficacy. However, the use of the mobile app increased teaching enthusiasm only when student teachers worked with their mentors. These results contribute to the relationship between mobile-enhanced internship experiences and teacher effectiveness factors. • Student teachers used a mobile portfolio app in two experimental studies during teacher education internships. • Each study evaluated different uses of the mobile app in a four-week, teaching internship in schools. • Internships experiences affected the development of teaching enthusiasm and teacher self-efficacy. • The use of the app increased teaching enthusiasm only when student teachers worked on the app with mentors.

        "In this study, we developed a digital game-based learning (DGBL) system, called the ToES, to foster students' creativity. Fifty-one fifth-grade students from two classes in a public school in Taipei, Taiwan, were recruited and consented to participate. Both classes consisted of students with mixed abilities studying a foundation unit entitled \"Electrical Science\" in a natural science course. One class was chosen to be the experimental group (EG) and the other class was the control group (CG). The goal of this study was to examine how different instructional strategies (i.e., traditional instruction and instruction using digital games) affected the students' creativity and their performance on manual skills. The analytical results indicated that the students' creativity and their performance on manual skills displayed positive growth when they were involved in acquiring knowledge and resolving tasks in a DGBL environment, which fostered their creativity and facilitated the generation of flow experiences. Moreover, there were three interesting findings related to the use of DGBL: (1) the ToES was an effective learning tool for cultivating the students' creativity; (2) there was a positive effect of creativity and their performance of manual skills; and (3) the ToES accelerated the improvement of practical behaviors regarding manual skills.

        "A review of evidence on the use of information and communication technologies (ICT) in the early years was commissioned by the British Educational Communications and Technology Agency. Views of practitioners, parents and children were obtained and practitioner ICT audits completed. Most young children grow up in media-rich digital environments in which they actively engage. Family members and practitioners are positive and actively promote use of ICT through ongoing socio-cultural practices. There appears to be a gap between children’s access to and use of ICT at home and in early years settings, and between state-maintained and non-maintained sectors. Training implications are marked. Cost of purchase, maintenance and replacement of age-appropriate digital technology remains a challenge and the development of active pedagogy to maximise benefits of technological advances must generate imaginative solutions.

        "College calculus teaches students important mathematical concepts and skills. The course also has a substantial impact on students’ attitude toward mathematics, affecting their career aspirations and desires to take more mathematics. This national US study of 3103 students at 123 colleges and universities tracks changes in students’ attitudes toward mathematics during a ‘mainstream’ calculus course while controlling for student backgrounds. The attitude measure combines students’ self-ratings of their mathematics confidence, interest in, and enjoyment of mathematics. Three major kinds of instructor pedagogy, identified through the factor analysis of 61 student-reported variables, are investigated for impact on student attitude as follows: (1) instructors who employ generally accepted ‘good teaching’ practices (e.g. clarity in presentation and answering questions, useful homework, fair exams, help outside of class) are found to have the most positive impact, particularly with students who began with a weaker initial attitude. (2) Use of educational ‘technology’ (e.g. graphing calculators, for demonstrations, in homework), on average, is found to have no impact on attitudes, except when used by graduate student instructors, which negatively affects students’ attitudes towards mathematics. (3) ‘Ambitious teaching’ (e.g. group work, word problems, ‘flipped’ reading, student explanations of thinking) has a small negative impact on student attitudes, while being a relatively more constructive influence only on students who already enjoyed a positive attitude toward mathematics and in classrooms with a large number of students. This study provides support for efforts to improve calculus teaching through the training of faculty and graduate students to use traditional ‘good teaching’ practices through professional development workshops and courses. As currently implemented, technology and ambitious pedagogical practices, while no doubt effective in certain classrooms, do not appear to have a reliable, positive impact on student attitudes toward mathematics.

        "This paper reports on a design-based intervention in urban primary and secondary schools serving culturally diverse students from low socio-economic status (SES) communities. The intervention capitalises on a partially implemented programme in seven schools which use digital devices (netbooks) and applications to raise literacy levels. Learning and teaching measures have been used to identify effective components which can be more systematically implemented. Classroom observations were employed to provide a profile of the use and quality of the literacy instruction and to identify effective instructional practices, thereby contributing to the redesign of instruction for cluster wide implementation. The study adds to a growing number of interventions which use a design-based approach to tackle problems associated with school effectiveness. It contributes to the identification of promising new practices and to the design of more effective instruction in the context of a national system (New Zealand) that is already generally of high quality in literacy teaching but with low equity. A specific outcome is further evidence about how new technologies and digital learning are being implemented in low SES classrooms and the relationships with valued student outcomes.

        "This paper explores the management and outcomes of a specific model of intergenerational learning, concerned with student digital leader support in a number of secondary schools in England. A local educational partnership set up a student digital leader project late in 2011, which aimed to develop a range of skills and outcomes for both the digital leaders themselves and for a potentially wider variety of personnel within the schools. Five schools were involved in the project. The student digital leaders shared their digital technology expertise with others with less developed skills, including teachers and managers in these schools. The study reported in this paper explored ways that the digital leader initiative was implemented, identifying and analysing outcomes and issues arising. Evidence from informants and from the analysis of benefits arising indicates that the student digital leader initiative led to a variety of positive outcomes. A key finding and conclusion is that this form of initiative has involved some students who tend not to be involved in other leadership or school-wide activities. The initiative enables these students to contribute to the community, rather than just receiving from it; students become active contributors to, as well as receivers from, the educational system.

        "In the twenty-first century, learning and teaching at school must prepare young people for engaging in a complex and dynamic world deeply influenced by globalisation and the revolution in digital technology. In addition to the use of digital technologies, is the development of flexible learning spaces. It is claimed that these developments demand, and lead to, enhanced reflective practice by teaching practitioners. This article is based on a project that has used multiple New Zealand case studies to engage teachers and leaders in interviews to explore their experiences at the futures-digital-reflective intersection. Critical theoretic and critical hermeneutic approaches inform the exploration of the relationships between reflective practice and twenty-first century learning by analysis and comparison of educational theoretical discourses with voices from a group of principals and ex-leaders on the one hand, and teachers, on the other hand.

        "With the current expansion of digital tools, the media used for narration is changing, challenging traditional literacies in educational settings. The present study explores what kind of activities emerge when six-year-old children in a preschool class write a digital story, using a word processor and speech-synthesised feedback computer software. Empirical material was collected in a primary school that participates in a larger community project on writing with digital technology. The focus of the study is on how the storytelling activity is mediated by the technologies and the participants (teacher and children). The results show that the digital tools used, in part, directed the children away from narrating, instead turning their attention to negotiations of division of labour and literate conventions. The latter were also at the forefront of the teacher's contributions to the children's activity. Despite these circumstances, the children succeed in accomplishing the instructed task of collaboratively composing a story. [ABSTRACT FROM PUBLISHER]",

        "A grand convergence looms. It seems at least plausible that health and physical education may soon be lived by students in ways that are radically different from the past and sharply at odds with the imaginings of its founders and generations of academic aficionados. Perhaps in some respects, the differences will be superficial and less important than the continuities. Nonetheless, I draw connections between some recent futurist literature, developments in social theory and trends in health education, physical education and school-based health intervention—fields that I collectively call ‘HPE’—in order to imagine their digital futures. I contend that there is much for these fields to consider as developments in digital technology, the commercialisation of education, the spread of surveillance culture and medicalisation reshape how people think about HPE and its reason for being. But rather than an apocalyptic warning, this is an invitation to others to engage with some important questions that, although already urgent, have gone largely unnoticed. For example, what kind of thing will eHPE be if/when it exists primarily to generate profits and monitor and measure the minutiae of everyday life? At the very least, my argument here is that if it is not already the case, questions of pedagogical process and effectiveness may soon struggle for relevance in HPE's digital future.

        "Remote and rural communities are often disadvantaged in terms of access to infrastructure, information and opportunities. The authors are concerned with two specific problems crucial to promoting sustainable online learning for the remote community. First, presenting learning content may not be sufficient to help students to improve their learning as they are not competent to make meaning from the information presented. Second, students are often not competent to articulate information from different perspectives or discuss complex issues. The authors' contributions are in four aspects (i) instructional design of learning activities, especially role playing (ii) design of learning content (iii) design of hint-based teaching-learning strategies to scaffold learning and (iv) design of technology-enhanced collaborative learning. This Knowledge Management (KM) framework has been used for the development of an instructional model incorporating a germane pedagogical setup which coalesces interactive learning and learner-centered factors. The process was illustrated with a case study from SMK Bario, Sarawak (Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan, local secondary school) with Form 2 students (14-15 years old) to show that the recommended matrix method has been applied to make a successful transition to a blended learning format that combines face-to-face sessions with distance communication. Findings indicated that students were able to filter and consider multiple perspectives, skillfully represent the problem in more ways than one, capable to quickly change focus and goals as the situation required and able to post questions about complicated and complex issues in open class discussions. The authors investigated whether KM processes, e-learning principles and Human Factors Engineering will promote sustainable online learning for the remote community. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "In this study, an e-learning environment was designed for teacher candidates. Teacher candidates developed multimedia-based projects by means of multimedia tools. This research aims to determine the effects of online and blended learning approaches on the success level of multimedia projects and the teacher candidates' attitudes, opinions and perceptions on e-learning. This study used a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods. There were two different groups in the study: online and blended groups. The online and the blended groups consisted of 30 and 32 teacher candidates, respectively. Teacher candidates in the blended group developed multimedia-based projects and shared information communicating in a WiziQ and Facebook environment with their peers and instructors when they were not at school. On the other hand, the teacher candidates in the online group communicated with their instructors and peers only in a WiziQ and Facebook environment. The results showed that the blended learning approach was more effective than the online learning approach. The usability of online learning and blended learning in higher education is addressed in recommendations for future research and practice. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "Considering the increasingly challenging resource environments in many business schools, this study examined whether course technologies, learner behaviors or instructor behaviors best predict online course outcomes so that administrators and support personnel can prioritize their efforts and investments. Based on reviewing prior online and blended management education literature, we hypothesized that instructor behaviors would be most predictive of online course outcomes. However, our study of 48 online Master of Business Administration courses found that although instructor behaviors (operationalized as teaching presence) was the strongest predictor of any of our three outcome variables (perceived learning), only student behaviors (operationalized as social presence) significantly predicted all three (course grades, perceived learning and delivery medium satisfaction). Technological characteristics, operationalized using variables from the technology acceptance model and media variety, predicted perceived learning (perceived ease of use) and delivery medium satisfaction (perceived usefulness). The paper provides recommendations for instructors and administrators based on the findings, specifically advocating for a balance between instructor and administrator involvement in course design, presentation and conduct. The paper concludes by describing research opportunities regarding the roles of social presence in and collaborative approaches to online learning in business schools. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "The purposes of this study were to develop the HappyCAD online engineering drawing system and to examine its effects on students' learning. The HappyCAD system includes instructional management and engineering drawing modules. The engineering drawing module provides three-dimensional (3D) models and interactive 3D solids. Learners can interact with the system and use various tools for drawing. Students can also receive feedback from teachers and redesign their engineering drawings. The HappyCAD system was implemented as an e-learning tool in an engineering graphics course for junior high school students. Students' perceptions of online learning with HappyCAD in engineering drawing were reported along with learning outcomes that resulted from their use of the e-learning tool. This study demonstrated the positive effects of an online engineering drawing system on students' engineering drawing literacy. The finding suggests that students generated positive attitudes towards learning engineering graphics in an online environment. Students' error patterns in drawings were also analyzed in this study.

        "This paper brings to the fore a cohort of student teachers' perceptions of an online learning experience during school placement in a Chinese tertiary institution; it critically explores factors contributing positively to online professional learning and the development of the community. An ethnographic case study approach was adopted. Findings indicate that online communication allows participants to recognize the significant presence of others in supporting and transforming their learning. It also fosters an appreciation and embracement of the multidimensional roles that they take on. Voluntary participation and empowerment emerge as key factors making this a vibrant professional community for professional growth. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "; This study of 723 college students seeks to assess the adequacy of the Community of Inquiry (CoI) framework for describing and explaining differences in learning outcomes in hybrid and fully online learning environments. Hypothesizing that the CoI model's theoretical constructs of presence reflect educational effectiveness in a variety of environments, this article seeks evidence of whether students in varying learning environments are likely to rank them differently with regard to teaching, social, and cognitive presence. The study utilizes factor-, hierarchical-regression-, and path analyses to determine the validity of the CoI constructs as well as to characterize the nature of relationships between them. Results suggest that the model is coherent and accounts for the small but significant differences recently reported in the literature regarding the superiority of hybrid environments relative to fully online environments (Means, B., Toyama, Y., Murphy, R., Bakia, M., & Jones, K. (2009). Evaluation of evidence-based practices in online learning: A meta-analysis and review of online learning studies.

        "; Schools’ use of digital technology has so far proved to be a peripheral feature of the Conservative-Liberal education agenda. Through a series of reductions to previously extensive bureaucratic and funding structures, the Coalition administration has presided over a swift but sustained withdrawal of state support for digital technology use in schools. Many commentators have been quick to decry these actions as signalling an ill-informed “absence of ambition” for what could be seen as an integral area of twenty-first century educational provision. However, this paper contends that the Coalition’s apparent technological indifference instead marks a deliberate “ambition of absence”. Thus as well as contributing to immediate reductions in central government spending, the apparent shunning of educational technology policy-making has been driven by the Coalition’s long-term ambitions for localised and largely privatised forms of public sector governance. With this in mind, the paper considers the intended influence of the Coalition’s policy reversals on the future use of digital technology in UK schools. It is suggested that rather than constituting an irreversible crisis, the current withdrawal of state support is perhaps best understood as a continuation of the fluctuating cycle of government (dis)interest in educational technology over the past 30 years"

        "Educational video games are hypothesized to be good environments for promoting learning; however, research on conceptual learning from games is mixed. We tested whether embedding a learning support in the form of short animations illustrating physics concepts that can be used to aid gameplay improved learning. Ninety-six 7th to 11th grade students were randomly assigned to play Physics Playground with or without the learning supports over a 4-day period. Results indicate that students who played a version of the game with embedded learning supports showed more improvement on a far- (d = 0.36), but not on a near-transfer physics assessment (d = 0.17) compared to those who played without the supports. The learning supports did not affect students' enjoyment with the game. We conclude that the game-embedded animations were effective at promoting conceptual learning without sacrificing the fun of game-based learning. • Studies show learning supports (LS) can improve educational game outcomes, but can hurt enjoyment. • We tested an embedded LS in a Physics game with secondary school students. • LS group had greater far transfer on a posttest than active controls. • Overall gain and far transfer gain correlated with duration of exposure to supports. • LS group did not report less enjoyment than the active control group.

        "This article explores how eight secondary school teachers integrated educational technology into English language teaching in Beijing, China and considers their views of the factors influencing technology use. Analysing data from classroom recordings and follow-up interviews, this study revealed that PowerPoint was the most frequently used technological application in the classroom, while the internet and other technological tools were also used by the teachers. They employed educational technology for different pedagogical purposes, including addressing professional needs in improving teaching, designing materials and conducting professional development. Teachers also claimed that they used technology to address learners' needs, such as improving engagement, enhancing language acquisition, facilitating understanding and establishing a context for language use. The study identified four important factors in influencing teachers' use of technology, including sociocultural contexts, teachers' beliefs, access to resources, and technology competence and confidence. This study suggests that a critical reflective approach is useful in assisting teachers to understand their needs and pedagogical beliefs concerning technology use. Ongoing professional development is also valuable in promoting teachers' technology competence and confidence, thereby improving the use of technology in their teaching. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "Despite significant research in the field of educational technology, there is still much we do not fully understand about students' experiences with technology. This article proposes that research in the field of educational technology would benefit from a sociological framing that pays attention to the understandings and lives of learners. Within a broader study that aimed to investigate students' use and value of technologies guided by Bourdieu's sociological theory, this article reports on qualitative embedded case study data of 12 students in years 9 and 10 from two Australian secondary schools. The article provides detailed accounts of students' experiences with technologies in various contexts with consideration of the milieu in which technology use occurred, illustrating the heterogeneous and complex network of influencing factors on students' technology practices. The findings and discussion augment the application of Bourdieu's concepts of field, habitus and capital as a tool to view and understand students' varied and complex experiences and relationships with technology.

        "In recent years, a significant problem that has manifested in the quest to capitalise on the pedagogical potential of technology in schools is that veteran teachers are unwilling to integrate these resources into their practices. Given that veteran teachers comprise up to 40% of teachers, their lack of use is important. This paper aims to shed light on the issue of detachment by presenting empirically based findings of a five-year, grounded theory examination of the technology practices of a small group of veteran teachers. Data included classroom observations, teacher interviews and document analysis of teacher and school planning documentation, student focus groups, interviews with teaching colleagues and key school technology personnel observation. Analysis included the application of the teachers’ data to a framework of dilemmas teachers encounter when expected to change their practice. In using this process, change fatigue and knowledge insecurity (brought about by cultural and political changes to their contexts) were prominent factors which contributed to the teachers’ lack of technology use. Identifying their challenges opened scrutiny to the myriad of factors they drew on when making decisions about how and whether to use technology in their practice. The longitudinal analysis of the data showed that as these dilemmas alleviated, the teachers became more committed to educational technology. The findings inform how we can move forward from the issue of veteran teachers’ lack of use of technology to how to support this group in the development of their practices. In particular, the need for a re-imagining of professional learning to one which focuses on reshaping cultural and political aspects of technology practices. This includes changes to the management of technology-related policy changes as well as facilitating learning communities that promote a valuing and sharing of relevant knowledge amongst teachers and students.

        "This study describes the massive open online course (MOOC) experiences of three educational technology scholars assuming the roles of learners. Adapting Carroll’s model of school learning as a theoretical framework, the study employed an autoethnography method to collect empirical data in three different MOOCs. Data analysis from regularly recorded journals revealed commonalities and differences in learner experiences. Based on the results, a refined version of Carroll’s model was produced to provide a foundation for future research and development into MOOCs. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "This paper explores the student experience of learning and teaching through the medium of videoconferencing (VC), on a range of HE programmes across all the partners of the University of the Highlands (UHI). The primary evidence used are the 190 responses to an online survey made available to any taught HE student at UHI that had taken modules where VC had played a significant role in delivery. Twenty-nine multiple choice, multiple answer and continuous response questions were asked, covering a wide range of subjects from students' circumstances of study, to how they rated different aspects of the experience. The study suggests that not only can VC succeed as a mode of educational delivery when undertaken by pioneering staff with a strong interest in educational technology, but it continues to succeed when delivered by an institution's rank and file teachers, as a mature technology that has lost its novelty value. The much greater sample size of this study compared to those that have been undertaken in the past also provides a quantitative basis for identifying the approaches to teaching which succeed best, and for identifying the groups amongst whom VC is best received. Key factors for success were found to be appropriate allocation and configuration of VC suites, effective training in the use of VC, and teaching that placed a premium on interaction with students. However, social circumstances appear to be as important as substantive quality factors in colouring perception. Students' rating of the technology as a mode of study seems to be heavily coloured by their access to educational alternatives. Students in remote locations appear more favourably disposed than those in larger campuses, mature students more than school leavers and women more than men. This has important implication for design and marketing of VC mediated degrees in the future. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "Game consoles have been adopted as a learning platform in school education. However, there is a scarcity of studies examining the utility of games consoles with built-in WiFi as affordable learning platforms in universities. This paper contributes to knowledge about the capacity of the Nintendo DSi to create new learning spaces mediated and supported by DSi consoles, free Flipnote Studio software for DS and a dedicated course website. An application of the DSi is described for remote supplemental language tutorial activities linking a dispersed body of students on a year-abroad programme. It was found that the use of DSi as a mobile learning platform has great potential if it is used in combination with shared webspace, such as Hatena, by increasing students' learning motivation and eliminating fears/uncertainty about their progress.

        "While digital technology has become a significant resource for contemporary schooling, we still have little understanding of how these resources shape teachers’ scholarly practices and what support is needed to improve and move forward. This paper reports on a 5-year qualitative, longitudinal study on the scholarly practices of a small number of Australian primary and secondary school teachers in their use of digital technology. The study aimed to understand the complexity of their changing practices. Four categories of change were evident in the teachers’ practice with digital technology over time: knowledge, learning organisation, pedagogy and core approaches to teaching. The changes each teacher demonstrated reflected their distinct knowledge sets and beliefs. Tracing their changes longitudinally showed that some teachers demonstrated faster and more consistent change in their practices with digital technology than others and that visible change in their practices was not evident over the short term. This study highlights that change in digital scholarship is a personal and complex process and worthy changes are those that meaningfully respond to the context and also contribute to the teachers’ commitment to reflection and renewal of practice. Significant support is therefore that which provides the space and opportunity for teachers’ individualised professional understandings and aspirations to be acknowledged and built on.

        "This article reports on an intervention that leverages game-based learning in citizenship education. The Rise of Li' Ttledot represents a curricular programme for citizenship education that was trialed in a primary school in 2011. It draws inspiration from prior research-based interventions in Singapore and attempts to translate key design principles from these earlier enactments to a younger demographic cohort of learners. It seeks to do so by providing a rich in-game experience and subsequently facilitating the abstraction of key citizenship values through a post-game programme of dialogic interaction between teacher and students. The article presents data that seems to support the degree and nature of scaffolding provided to facilitate these abstractions among younger learners. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "The idea of using digital technologies and in particular web 2.0 tools to enhance school collaboration has recently been received with great enthusiasm and a range of new collaborative initiatives has emerged. Through a comparative qualitative case study of four schools in the UK and Greece, this article analyses how online tools are supporting and facilitating school collaboration within the 'e Twinning' programme - an EU initiative that seeks to promote web-based learning and collaboration between schools across Europe. In particular, it examines teachers' and students' compromised experiences of the tech-based e Twinning projects and highlights the factors that seemed to be undermining collaboration. It analyses whether the implementation of digital technologies for school collaboration has the potential to transform classroom practices or whether existing habits and 'ways of doing' are brought into new contexts - leading to another case of 'the old wine in new bottles' syndrome often attributed to the use of digital technology in education.

        "This study aims to show how music technology mediated (or music software mediated) music teaching and learning can provide an effective pedagogy in music education. It also seeks to demonstrate that music technology mediated teaching is in accordance with socio-educational trends for both postmodern values and IT mediated learning. The new approach in this study utilizes the principles of “convergence” and applies diverse digital technologies to the class. After implementing the music technology mediated approach to an after-school program in an elementary school in Gyeonggi Province in Korea for 3 months, this study analyzed mind maps, in-depth interviews with the students, and surveys to examine how the students changed in terms of creative engagement and perception of music in everyday life. Results indicate that the digital technology mediated teaching and learning approach have the potential to enhance students’ self-motivated engagement in the music class and their perception of music in general.

        "; Despite widespread internet provision in UK schools, there is little evidence to suggest resultant, sustained educational benefit. Drawing upon the notion of over-blocking, this paper explores how narrow notions of digital learning and over-zealous responses to internet risks limit students’ educational experience. It is argued that this undermines digital literacy, raises questions about the future role of schools, exacerbates information poverty and limits the potential for democratic engagement. Adopting a zemiological approach privileging social harm may provide a solution to such problems insofar as it focuses on resolution not blame, existing issues rather than future ones and the facilitation of open, democratic discussion"

        "; This paper argues that educational technology in the Greek-Cypriot educational system has reached a critical point since ICT now appears for the first time in the newly reformed national curriculum. This study primarily illuminates the ways in which ICT is depicted in this curriculum with regards to primary education and, secondarily, explores whether the approach adopted appears consistent. The methodology employed involves a documentary analysis of the reformed curriculum in terms of four domains: rationale, content, teaching methodology as well as achievement processes across the 15 subject areas. Findings indicate that references to three ICT-related words are only made in some subjects. In addition, these references reflect either the socio-economic rationale towards ICT competency -also expressed in the general aims of the new NC- or the educational rationale, underlying the contribution of ICT to teaching and learning. Consequently, the approach towards new technologies fails to emerge as systematic across all primary school subjects. In this regard, although the inclusion of ICT in the reformed NC of the Greek-Cypriot educational system is certainly a way forward, the intended curriculum needs to be revised to reflect a clear approach, resembling either a focus on ICT competency or the educational perspective, or both. Furthermore, in anticipation of the implemented and attained curriculum, school structures as well as teacher professional development arise as issues for further consideration"

        "; Although Information and Communication Technology (ICT) seems a promising tool in an educational context, many teachers are reluctant to integrate it in their daily practice. A large scale survey was undertaken amongst primary and secondary school teachers in the Netherlands to explore possible determinants of the educational use of digital learning materials (DLMs) in order to develop interventions to reduce teachers’ reluctance to use ICT and more specifically to stimulate the use of DLMs. Basing on the Integrative Model of Behaviour Prediction it was conjectured that self-efficacy, attitude and subjective norm would take a central role in explaining the intention to use DLMs. Several other predictors were added to the conceptual model whose effects were hypothesized to be mediated by the three central variables. All conjectured relationships were found using mediation analysis on survey data from 1,484 teachers. Intention to use DLMs was most strongly determined by attitude, followed by self-efficacy. ICT skills was in its turn the strongest predictor of self-efficacy. Subjective norm played only a limited role in the intention to use DLMs. Basing on the outcome of this study, persuasive communication focusing on positive outcomes and skills based training seem appropriate interventions to promote a positive attitude towards DLM and improve self-efficacy in using DLMs"

        "This exploratory case study research describes the integration of Information Communication Technology (ICT) into the teaching and learning of English, mathematics and science in an elementary school in Singapore. The school in this case study research is one of the first primary-level future schools that was set up under the FutureSchools@Singapore program in 2008. The school has implemented a successful one-to-one program (i.e. one-to-one computer to student ratio) for all its students. The use of blogs, communication applications (e.g. online chats and email), online educational games, online learning management systems, online searches for information and educational related videos were commonly used to integrate ICT into the teaching and learning of the various subjects mentioned above. A total of 221 (Primary 3 and 4) and 466 (Primary 3, 4 and 5) students participated in an ICT usage survey conducted in 2011 and 2012, respectively. Three interesting phenomena were observed through the descriptive statistics. First, it was observed that the ICT usage rates for the various subjects (i.e. English, mathematics and science) peaked at the primary 4 level when the computer ownership program was introduced and declined in primary 5. Second, descriptive statistical analysis suggested the use of blogs, communication applications, online educational games and Internet searches, were more frequently used, as compared to the learning management systems and the use of videos, in the students’ learning of English, mathematics and science. Thirdly, ICT usage rates were also different for the different classes of Primary 5. Follow-up interviews with teachers and student open-ended survey responses were also analysed. The triangulated findings seemed to suggest that blogs were frequently used and acted as gateways to other online software applications. The findings also once again pointed to the importance of the sociocultural context – school leadership, curriculum planning and assessment, technological infrastructure and teachers’ practices – in ICT usage and integration in schools.

        "Introduction: Teaching is a necessary skill for medical trainees and physicians. We designed and launched a developmental Student-as-Teacher program for all students, beginning with the class of 2016. Methods: A task force of faculty and students designed the program. The goal is to enable all students to acquire basic principles of teaching and learning at different stages in their four-year medical school career. Upon completion, students will achieve twenty-eight learning objectives grouped within four competency domains: (1) Adult and Practice-Based Learning; (2) Learning Environment; (3) Instructional Design and Performance; and, (4) Learner's Assessment and Evaluation. The program combines online learning modules and a field teaching experience. Results: The entire class of 2016 ( N = 200) completed the first online module. Students found the module effective, and 70% reported an increase in their level of knowledge. Although most students are expected to complete their field teaching experience in fourth year, twelve students completed their field experience in first year. Reported strengths of these experiences include reinforcement of their medical knowledge and improvement of their adult teaching skills. Conclusions: The program was successfully launched, and students are already experiencing the benefits of training in basic teaching skills in the first year of the program. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "First-year university students exhibit considerably different levels of proficiency, often lacking the necessary prerequisites to attend certain courses. This is especially true for mathematics courses. While motivation alone plays a role, by far the most significant challenge consists in harmonising the different (and often incompatible) backgrounds of the students. In response, universities have made various attempts to tackle this issue. Many institutions now offer intensive courses prior to academic entry or even complete introductory courses occupying the whole first term, whether in a classroom or (partially) online. Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), while relatively unknown until a few months ago, have brought about a real educational revolution. The MOOC is an educational model that brings online learning content to any person willing to participate. At Pompeu Fabra University (UPF) we were intrigued by this new educational paradigm and wondered whether it could be useful in filling the gap between high school and university. Therefore, we recently designed and implemented such a course: while remaining available to anyone, the course specifically targets our prospective students who in turn should tackle first-year linear algebra having acquired an adequate background. In this paper we describe the first MOOC launched by UPF, ‘Decoding Algebra’. We provide an overview of its design, the technological means we used, our students’ profile and the lessons from this experience. More importantly, by focusing on our incoming students, we examine whether MOOCs can be a good approach to level out the differences among first-year university students. [ABSTRACT FROM PUBLISHER]",

        "; The mobile internet is a new and fast developing industry, which requires a lot of talent. The computer major in vocational colleges faces the difficulty of recruiting students and a low employment rate of graduates. The solution is to establish new courses in line with the development of IT industry. Android programming is an important technology of the mobile internet. Constructing a web–based course can propagate this new technology to higher vocational students. After analysing the learning characteristics of higher vocational students and the course characteristics of Android programming, this article proposes a framework for the web–based course on Android programming for higher vocational students and discusses how to design the course content by applying project–based teaching. The course embodies personalised learning, project–oriented teaching, mutual aid learning, and mobile learning. The result shows that the course is useful for students to study Android programming and majority of the students engage with the designed learning activities in the course"

        "Research and development of information and communication technology ( ICT)-supported learning for people with disabilities has not received adequate attention. It is also difficult to access research findings and developments in this field. Under the ENABLE Network of ICT Supported Learning for Disabled People (2011-2014) project, an emerging European Union reference point portal for end-users will provide this information for a broad audience. In the design phase of the project idea, the authors of this paper conducted a review of papers indexed in Web of Science to provide a needs assessment and a design template for the project objectives. The results of the search clearly showed that ICT-supported learning for people with special educational needs is in the domain of the educational technology journals, with more papers published in the British Journal of Educational Technology than in any other journal. This paper presents the results of a content analysis of all papers published from 1970 to 2011 in seven educational technology journals indexed in Web of Science. More papers were published from 2006 to 2011 (44.7%) than during any other of five periods examined. Findings in terms of ICT intervention, disability groups, groups of study participants by relationship with ICT, and research design, together with trends in published studies in terms of mainstreaming and inclusion, are presented. The main objective of the study was to identify the level of inclusion through analysis of educational context (special schools [30.51%], mainstream schools [28.81%] and general support for life [40.68%]). Based on content analysis, ICT interventions were classified into the two categories of technical intervention in the pedagogical context (62.71% of all papers published) and technical intervention in the wider context (37.29% of all papers published), with nine paper types identified: papers on ICT access, papers on teaching and learning methods, papers on development and testing of ICT solutions, reviews, assessments, papers on inclusion, papers on behavioural and social development, papers on use of information technology and papers on interaction. Papers were also categorised according to types of disability and according to groups of study participants by relationship with ICT. Published papers were divided into four categories by research design: descriptive (49.15%), developmental (26.27%), experimental (17.8%), and developmental and experimental (6.78%). During the period from 1970 to 2000, papers examined design of learning materials with regard to particular categories of disability and particular accessibility needs, while papers published after 2000 also discussed universal design. Based on the review, the authors of this paper have identified a need for application of universal design principles in research and development of learning environments to provide equal accessibility and inclusive education.

        "This paper provides an overview of the status of educational technology in Turkey. In the face of severe social and economic challenges, many developing nations, including Turkey, are looking to education as a potential remedy. Recognizing that in an increasingly technology-dependent world, information and communications technology skills and knowledge are critical in order to compete in the global marketplace, Turkey is firmly committed not only to improving its education system, but also to incorporating the use of educational technologies into the instructional strategy and curriculum used in schools. This is a critical initiative because, as research shows, technology-enriched educational environments can provide students with significantly expanded learning opportunities, which are linked with increased levels of academic achievement. However, like many other developing countries, Turkey is struggling to overcome a number of serious barriers to full technology integration at the classroom level, the most significant of which is non-compliance on the part of teachers. With respect to technology use in education, teachers are consistently failing to utilize technological tools for instruction purposes, for a variety of reasons. Turkey must address these reasons in order to ensure that the agenda of technology adoption into schools, an enormously expensive undertaking, does not fail. [ABSTRACT FROM PUBLISHER]",

        "; This article discusses the research findings from the start-up phase of an innovative information and communication technology (ICT) project focused on ICT integration as a complex process involving many factors such as leadership, school readiness and organisational culture. Known locally as Hermes, the project's core objective was to provide an improved and ‘trouble-free’ ICT infrastructure for schools using thin client technology and a wireless broadband network, which would be managed centrally rather than locally. It was anticipated that this solution would help remove the barriers associated with ICT integration caused by technical issues. Based on an in-depth study of innovation adoption in eight schools involving a survey (n=119 teachers) and interviews (n=60 teachers), the study portrays a picture of the ICT integration patterns prior to and during the Hermes intervention in terms of schools' ICT readiness, leadership and vision. This small scale study can help us understand first- and second-order barriers to ICT integration in schools. In particular, this study informs us about the ecology of schools and ICT-based innovation, innovation scalability and contributes to a critical study of educational technology via a context-rich account of how educational technology is actually being mediated, rather than an idealised account of how technology could be used"

The sample were 27 lower secondary school students (aged 12-13 years old) who collaborated within an OLC set up by their teacher by means of the free Yahoo Groups service in order to complete an EE project. The experimental intervention lasted for 10 weeks. Before and after the intervention, the students filled in a questionnaire addressing: a) their knowledge and attitudes regarding the natural environment, b) their social skills and c) their attitudes and skills regarding ICT. The study revealed that the OLC was a viable solution for supporting student collaboration in the implementation of the EE project, and that student participation in the OLC had positive effects on students' knowledge and attitudes towards the natural environment, on their social skills as well as their attitudes and skills regarding ICT"

The study examines the context, design and implementation of a learning activity which integrated student-centred approaches, experiential learning, authenticity and the particular needs of the New Zealand school curriculum to foster pre-service teachers’ learning about educational technologies as both pedagogical tools, and as ‘disruptive’ forces which can promote the re-imagining of existing practices. Evaluation data are used to highlight support for an integrated approach to the use of educational technologies outlined in the case in question. [ABSTRACT FROM PUBLISHER]",

        "This paper considers professional development in a context that is familiar and problematic to teaching teams in tertiary education everywhere, that of delivering online programmes with an ever-decreasing complement of staff. The Teaching Qualification Further Education (TQFE) teaching team at University of Dundee confronted the reality of reduced staff numbers by centralising tutoring and support for programme participants. The new system involves standardising tutoring as far as possible through generic email, blog and microblog accounts, all badged 'TQFE-Tutor' and staffed on a roster basis. Once the new 'rules of engagement' via TQFE-Tutor were in place, it became clear that in addition to benefits in terms of student support, there were other unintended positive consequences: opportunities for informal professional development for staff and the promotion of effective team working. The experience of collective tutoring has facilitated collaboration on a range of innovations within online learning. This paper describes the evolution of the TQFE-Tutor innovation and reports upon a small scale study which was carried out to gather the views of the tutor team working with TQFE-Tutor. The authors conclude that the centralisation of communication and tutoring on the TQFE programme has been highly beneficial in terms of professional development for the team. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "There have been significant advance in educational technology but they have not always brought about measurable shifts in user behavior. This study examined the relationship between teachers’ knowledge about a tool and their use of that tool. In many secondary schools use of a Learning Platforms (LPs) is no longer optional although the degree of engagement with the technology remains a matter of choice. However, individual decisions to use selected functionalities of these systems are not well captured in current models of technology acceptance. In a best-case scenario, self-reported possible and actual use of LPs was acquired for 50 teachers from eight technology-rich schools. Three key barriers to use were identified: the functionality of the software, workloads and personal interest. Based on teachers’ knowledge of LP functionality and perceived barriers to use, four distinct groups of teachers emerged. A low-user group identified all three barriers, showed little enthusiasm for use of this technology and had a markedly impoverished perception of the LP. There were three distinct higher use groups based on perceived barriers. While the functions used by these three groups showed less variation, with innovative functions such Blogs and Wikis remaining aspirational, there were differences in how such limitations were viewed. Whether the response was one of complacency and frustration has implications for professional development programmes. [ABSTRACT FROM PUBLISHER]",

        "Getting citizens prepared to emergencies, and especially children, is an essential issue which requires special attention in the educational process. Many evidences show that misconceptions about natural disaster and incorrect beliefs are often the basis for misguided actions that can lead to inefficient behaviours in case of dangerous events. Then school has a major role in the development of 'disaster-aware' citizens, since it is asked to design appropriate resources and select suitable methods able to guarantee retention and progression of the learning process. Teaching emergency preparedness involves studying several complex topics and more than some studies have shown that storytelling can be an effective method for teaching subjects that are intricate in nature. The educational technology considers research on construction of digital storytelling as an educational challenge. Digital narratives even gain noticeable importance when users' emotions are taken into account. Basing on these considerations, we propose in this work an adaptive, dynamic and narrative-based digital artefact in which emotions are used to rebalance the learners' status. We experimented this learning resource to teach earthquake preparedness in Italian secondary schools. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "; This article argues for a flexible model of learning for adults which allows them to make choices and contextualise their learning in a manner appropriate to their own professional practice whilst also developing as a member of a learning community. It presents a design based around online 'learning activities' which draws on ideas of constructivism, collaborative learning and reflective practice. The model was developed for adult learning in Higher Education, and has been adapted and extended to a number of different programmes. Implementation of the model for the Teaching Qualification (Further Education) has been the subject of an interpretative evaluation using a multiple methods approach. Learners' experiences of this programme together with issues associated with the application of the model to other programmes are discussed"

        "This paper explored informal (after-school) and formal (elective course in-school) learning contexts as contributors to middle-school student attitudinal changes in a guided discovery-based and blended e-learning program in which students designed web games and used social media and information resources for a full school year. Formality of the program context did not substantially influence attitude changes but did appear to influence learning outcomes. While intrinsic motivation did not change in the aggregate from pre- to post-program among students, positive changes in intrinsic motivation were found to be associated with engagement in almost all areas of student engagement inGlobaloria, with several at-home engagement changes measured. This finding challenges critiques of discovery-based learning as being de-motivating. Lower parent education among students was associated with positive changes in self-efficacy for online research indicating that disadvantaged students may stand to benefit from programs like this one. The study offers support for the need to more definitively explicate instructional design and context factors in educational technology research when investigating influences upon learning outcomes. The study holds implications for designing effective digital literacy interventions, and contributes to theory in the learning sciences and socio-technical systems research. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "This paper examines the emergence of schools ‘micro-computing’ in the UK between 1977 and 1984 – a period of significant educational, technological and political change. During this time, computing developed rapidly from a niche activity in a few select schools to the state subsidized purchasing of a ‘computer in every school’ and the nationwide promotion of computers as a feature of curriculum and pedagogy. Through a series of in-depth retrospective interviews with key policy actors (n=20) this paper develops a detailed ‘policy historiography’ of this period - shedding light on the complex power relations and interests that underpinned these developments. In particular, the paper highlights the origins of these policy interventions in earlier activities, and examines the negotiations and conflicts between and within the two government departments involved in the mass introduction of computing into the UK school system.

        "; How is the link between learner and technology made in mobile learning? What is the value of the concept of ‘affordances’? And how does research articulating this concept act to position mobile devices as ‘technologies for learning’? This literature review used both unstructured and structured search samples of published research on mobile learning to critically evaluate the prevalence and influence of the concept of the affordances of mobile technologies. Actor-network theory is drawn on as a theoretical lens through which to critically consider how this concept is articulated, and in particular to explore the way it positions and controls mobile devices as technologies for learning. Parallels in contemporary accounts of mobile learning are drawn with classifications of previous discourses around the introduction of computers into schools. An alternative agenda for mobile learning research is suggested with a focus on authentic and informal contexts rather than controlled experiments"

        "Despite the long-standing interest in educational technology reforms, many researchers have found that it is difficult to incorporate advanced information and communications technologies (ICT) in classrooms. Many ICT projects, particularly in the developing world, are limited by the lack of integration between pedagogy and technology. This article presents a framework for integrating ICT technology and inquiry-based pedagogies in classroom settings: the Stanford Mobile Inquiry-based Learning Environment (SMILE). It then outlines findings from a series of studies that tested SMILE's effectiveness in various country contexts. SMILE successfully spurs student questioning and changes student-teacher dynamics in class. On the other hand, school and country contexts influence students' initial abilities to form deep inquiries, and SMILE is more difficult to implement in areas where rote memorization pedagogies are typical. The authors advocate further research on the effect of long-term interventions. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "Many students in primary education learn arithmetic using adaptive learning technologies (ALTs) on tablets every day. Driven by developments in the emerging field of learning analytics, these technologies adjust problems based on learners' performance. Yet, until now it is largely unclear how students regulate their learning with ALTs. Hence, we explored how learners regulate their effort, accuracy and learning with an ALT using moment-by-moment learning curves. The results indicated that moment-by-moment learning curves did reflect students' accuracy and learning, but no associations with effort were found. Immediate drops were associated with high prior knowledge and suboptimal learning. Immediate peaks were associated with robust learning and pointed to effective student regulation. Close multiple spikes showed moderate learning and lower initial levels of accuracy but, with system support, these students seemed able to regulate their learning. Separated multiple spikes indicated reduced learning and accuracy and potentially signal the inability of students to regulate their learning. In this light, moment-by-moment learning curves seem to be valuable indicators of accuracy regulation during learning with ALTs and could potentially be used in interventions to support SRL with personalized visualizations. • Children show differential effort and accuracy regulation while learning with ALTs. • Moment-by-moment learning curves are associated to childrens' accuracy and learning. • Moment-by-moment learning curves are indicative learners efficiency of regulation over time.

        "• Training on pharmacovigilance issues seems to be limited in pharmacy curriculum. • Pharmacy undergraduates´ knowledge on pharmacovigilance and adverse drug reactions reporting presented some constrains. • In general, the application of educational guidelines on pharmacovigilance training was missing in pharmacy courses. • Practical and theoretical classes and real practices on pharmacovigilance topics are encouraged in pharmacy schools. • Standardization of pharmacovigilance training is advisable. Educational training on pharmacovigilance is essential in pharmacy curriculum. Aim: to carry out a systematic review about students' learning outcomes on pharmacovigilance. The Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses checklist and flow diagram (PRISMA) was applied. Databases: PubMed , SciELO , DOAJ , and Cochrane Library (02–03–2017 to 02–03–2021). keywords: \"pharmacy\" and (\"student\" or \"undergraduate\") and (\"learning\" or \"teaching\" or \"training\") and (\"adverse drug\" or \"pharmacovigilance\" or \"interactions\"). Overall, 27 out of 274 studies were selected. Educational research on pharmacovigilance training seemed to be scarce and standardization and/or application of guidelines were lacking. Diverse educational practices about pharmacovigilance seems to be emerging in scientific databases (e.g. active learning or gamification). Classic lectures should preferably be supplemented with practical and clinical pharmacovigilance activities. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "Hong Kong was one of the first public school systems in the world to shift to online learning in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Primary and secondary school language teachers had to adapt instruction to cater to their students' diverse linguistic and educational needs. Drawing from the European Framework for the Digital Competence of Educators (DCE), the current study examines the experiences of primary and secondary school English language teachers' digital competence as they navigated digital resources, teaching and learning, assessment, and empowering learners in an emergency remote teaching context. Using a two-stage design, this study drew from qualitative survey data (N = 73) and follow-up interviews (N = 10). Findings illuminate how language teachers responded to their students' educational and linguistic needs in online environments. Notably, educators adapted their virtual instruction to cater to students with varying English language proficiency levels and leveraged both synchronous and asynchronous platforms to best support student learning. Moreover, the current study sheds light on how the DCE framework might be used as a tool to assess the digital competencies of educators and better prepare them for virtual teaching. It concludes with a call for more research on emergency remote teaching, particularly within primary and secondary language classrooms. • The current study examines the digital competence of primary and secondary school language teachers in Hong Kong. • The study uses a Digital Competencies Framework to understand digital resources, pedagogy, assessments and learners online. • Teachers engaged in strategic decision-making about synchronous and asynchronous technologies for instruction. • Teachers also reconsidered the purpose and process of lesson preparation, student engagement and assessments. • Implications for equipping teachers with digital competence through teacher training and ongoing development are discussed.

        "There are great expectations that new digital technology will become a powerful tool for developing education activities. Like many countries in Europe and worldwide, Sweden has invested a large amount of resources in new technology and new media (hereafter called digital media), and they have become a natural and important part of school teaching. The developed use of digital media is assumed to lead to educational change and, hence, better teaching. That such expectations have not been fulfilled, however, is shown in a number of Swedish, European and international studies. One explanation of this situation may be that the incorporation of digital media differs between different school subjects. School subjects have their characteristic structures, which are of great importance for how digital media can be integrated. Digital media influence the way in which school subjects can be described from a knowledge theory perspective — i.e. what constitutes the subject's paradigm and its teaching practice. The point of departure of this article is the school subjects of art, music and the mother tongue (Swedish), which, like other school subjects, are feeling the pressure of a digital media and screen culture to an ever increasing degree, and it queries whether and how teachers and pupils in these three school subjects conceive of and relate to the shifts that take place in the subjects when digital media are being increasingly integrated into the teaching. The study is based on interviews with pupils and teachers in the three school subjects, and the results are presented in terms of four themes that appear in the investigation — namely: (1) educational environments; (2) what teachers and pupils regard as the sacred and the profane; (3) motives for using digital media in teaching; and (4) whether and how working methods are changing with digital technology, i.e. questions concerning collective and individual aspects. In all three subjects, there are clear indications that digital media have already started to influence both the subject content and the working methods, while, at the same time, the proportion of digital media is limited and the impact is weak.

        "; The music industry in the 21st century uses digital technology in a wide range of applications including performance, composition and in recording and publishing. Much of this digital technology is freely available via downloads from the internet, as part of software included with computers when they are purchased and via applications that are available for some mobile phones. Such technology is transforming music and the way people approach many traditional music activities. This paper is about transformative practices that are underway in some secondary school music classrooms. Practices are being shaped by the culture of the schools and the students that they recruit. We describe the perceptions and practices of nine music teachers in four New Zealand secondary schools with regard to digital technology and how they are changing their work in their classroom. Data collection techniques include interviews, observation and a questionnaire. The data were subjected to two stages of thematic analysis. Grounded analysis was used to allow the teachers' voices emerge. This was then followed by the application of five themes identified in the literature on pedagogic change prompted by teachers' adoption of digital technologies"

        "; Information and communication technology (ICT) can enable, support, and reinforce the introduction of new pedagogical practices that comply with the educational demands of the twenty-first-century knowledge society. However, despite this potential and despite the delivering of skills-based professional development and the increase in the level of ICT infrastructure, teachers are more often reluctant rather than willing to use ICT. This article reviews existing literature to 1) select a theoretical model that is suited to explain this, and 2) uncover important variables at various levels, including the individual and school organisation that should be included in the model. As a result, it adopts Fishbein’s Integrative Model of Behaviour Prediction (IMBP). This model forces the explicit consideration of dispositional variables including attitude, self-efficacy and subjective norm that are the direct and indirect antecedents of intentional ICT usage and real ICT use. Rather than concentrating on general ICT usage, IMBP is concerned with the use of specific ICT tools, such as digital learning materials. The authors believe that IMBP as a diagnostic tool will shed more light upon the issues surrounding teachers’ ICT usage"

        "; The development of an ethos of academic care is about creating the structures, both formal and informal, that cater for the developmental learning needs of students. Such an approach celebrates individual difference in the belief that academic care will not only underpin improved academic performance but will also build confidence in the ability to learn. For over 30 years the economic field has been all pervasive. Human endeavour seemed entrapped by the demands of efficiency and the profit motive. The language of nurture and care, language that forms such an essential part of educational discourse, was consumed by economism. It is now time to redefine educational practice to celebrate pedagogy and learning. The development of an ethos of academic care is one way in which educators can start to redraw the boundaries. This paper draws together a number of disparate themes based on my observations over many years. They are based on my various roles as a curriculum leader, syllabus writer and teacher, as well as my discussions with parents and students concerning digital learning technologies. The essential premise is that academic care matters and that therefore schools need to commit to its strategic implementation. It is a contention of this paper that there is a renewed role for the house group teacher as ‘learning hero’ in a structure that is based on an ethos of academic care"

        "We investigated how often teachers apply digital technology in their teaching and which student learning activities teachers initiate. Further, we analyzed factors relating to technology use. 410 teachers in our sample, representative for the state of Bavaria (Germany), reported that they spend a substantial amount of time using digital technologies in a typical lesson. Results indicated that rather teachers' basic digital skills and technology-related teaching skills than digital technology resources are crucial. Even though a certain threshold level of digital technology is necessary in school, our results suggest shifting the focus from equipping schools to teachers' skills using technologies effectively. • Teachers from a representative sample (Bavaria, Germany) report how they use technology in class. • Teachers are employing digital technologies frequently in their teaching. • In a significant amount of the time of technology use students are passive. • Availability of technology does not relate to the type of teachers' technology use. • Teachers' skills are positively related to frequency and types of technology use.

        "; Significant numbers of children (6% of 11-year-olds) have difficulties learning to read. Meanwhile, children who receive appropriate support from their parents do better in literacy than those who do not. This study uses a case study approach to investigate how digital games designed to support struggling readers in school were used at home, by the parents of six children to support their children's literacy. Mostly, the children enjoyed playing the games and believe that it helped improve their reading. The parents all valued the opportunity to participate in their child's learning and believe that the games' approach to learning is effective. The study considers key influences on the successful use of games to support struggling readers (repetition, feedback, motivation, self-efficacy, parental beliefs) and raises questions, further consideration of which might usefully inform the future development of effective game-based learning"

        "The purpose of this research is to create a model of constructivist blended learning environment which will contribute to the development of listening and speaking skills, and which consists of faceto- face and online dimensions. The participants of the implementations for developing the blended learning environment are composed of 26 fourth graders - 12 girls and 14 boys - who attend a private elementary school in the academic year 2011-2012. The learning environment is evaluated based on the rate of using the learning environment by the participants and on their feedbacks. The developmental characteristics and interests of the fourth graders attending the elementary school where the model will be implemented are taken into consideration in developing the blended learning environment. Since the research is limited to the language skills of listening and speaking, the face-to-face and online learning environments are based on only these skills. The creation and development of the blended learning environment is presented under the subheadings of analysis, design, development, implementation and evaluation. As a result of the research which is conducted in the blended learning environment, it is concluded that the participants usually have shared sound recordings related to the theme \"listen\" most and the theme \"tell\" least among the themes \"listen\", \"watch\" and \"tell\"; that the participation in the implementation has decreased in time; and that the participants have been satisfied with studying in such an environment.

        "; Background: The ubiquity, availability and exponential growth of digital information and communication technology (ICT) creates unique opportunities for learning and teaching in the senior secondary school biology curriculum. Digital technologies make it possible for emerging disciplinary knowledge and understanding of biological processes previously too small, large, slow or fast to be taught. Indeed, much of bioscience can now be effectively taught via digital technology, since its representational and symbolic forms are in digital formats. Purpose: This paper is part of a larger Australian study dealing with the technologies and modalities of learning biology in secondary schools. Sample: The classroom practices of three experienced biology teachers, working in a range of NSW secondary schools, are compared and contrasted to illustrate how the challenges of limited technologies are confronted to seamlessly integrate what is available into a number of molecular genetics lessons to enhance student learning. Design and method: The data are qualitative and the analysis is based on video classroom observations and semi-structured teacher interviews. Results: Findings indicate that if professional development opportunities are provided where the pedagogy of learning and teaching of both the relevant biology and its digital representations are available, then teachers see the immediate pedagogic benefit to student learning. In particular, teachers use ICT for challenging genetic concepts despite limited computer hardware and software availability. Conclusion: Experienced teachers incorporate ICT, however limited, in order to improve the quality of student learning"

        "; Virtual Learning Environments (VLEs) in teacher education have a short history which is little longer than that of this journal. Twenty years ago they were the province of early adopters only and limited to email and, more unusually, asynchronous conferencing. Today, VLEs are widespread and mainstream, sophisticated and officially sanctioned components of many courses. Research in this field has borne some of the hallmarks of Underwood’s seminal critique of research in education technology more generally, namely, failure to construct and build upon the history of the field; failure to use the language and theoretical perspectives of the field; a focus on technology rather than on its impact on practice; and an over-reliance on qualitative methods. The three snapshots which are used as a basis of the study show, to an extent, that the technology has moved from unreliable and primitive, to reliable, ambient and versatile. Less obvious in these snapshots are any substantial changes in pedagogy over time although social learning theories seem to have increasing prevalence in support of collaborative learning praxis. Throughout the sample, it is notable that the impact of teachers’ online learning on teaching and learning in schools is still relatively rarely investigated"

        "; The introduction of a new mandatory policy for the teaching of English at the higher education level in China, College English Curriculum Requirements (CECR, published in 2004), had the intention of modernising and improving the quality of English teaching at the tertiary level in China. The policy had a focus on student-centred approaches to learning and the use of a new computer-based multimedia teaching model to support this process. This paper reports on a study that investigated the views of teachers, administrators and policy makers about the intended use of educational technology embedded in the policy and the success of the policy in achieving this goal. The paper attempts to clarify how lecturers in higher education in China have been oriented by the CECR towards pedagogical change. This paper reports on the responses of teachers towards the specific requirements of CECR 2004 by reviewing their present understanding of information and communications technology (ICT), the requirements of CECR 2004 regarding ICT, the present consensus on ICT in pedagogy and the views of policy makers and administrators about these issues. This paper argues that there is a gap between the policy and the reality in terms of ICT pedagogy in tertiary English teaching in the context of China"

        "; Rhetoric about young people’s ‘ownership’ of future socio-technical change is a familiar part of much educational and political discourse. This does not, however, translate in practice into a meaningful dialogue with young people about the sorts of futures they might wish to see emerge. This paper argues that a number of social and technological developments currently being envisaged by researchers, developers, industry and politicians bring with them a responsibility to rethink the relationship between young people, education and socio-technical futures. It focuses specifically on trends in the areas of personal augmentation, digital working practices and intergenerational spaces and discusses the implications of projected developments in these areas for young people’s educational, economic and democratic futures. It argues that schools need to be cognisant of these future possibilities and need to create spaces and practices that enable young people together to understand and explore these issues. The school also is not immune to socio-technical change. The potential growth of online learning communities, the emergence of a body of adults able to participate as informal educators and the development of networked publics, in particular, have the potential to change the relationship between school, young people and society. These changes have the potential either to erode or to radically reinvigorate the capacity of schools to act as public spaces within which young people can be supported to negotiate and explore future socio-technical change"

        "; A problem that is still unexplored in the field of socioscientific issues (SSI) and that was explored in this study is how different students decide upon a SSI they are discussing, how their justifications change during the instruction and how they use (or not) the evidence from the learning environment to support their justifications. For the purposes of this study, two classes (12–13-year-old students) with diverse characteristics were selected from two different schools in the UK. Class A students, considered high achievers come from a white-British background. Class B students considered average achievers come from an Asian British background. The students engaged in discussions regarding a SSI (Should we kill the grey squirrel to save the red?), supported by an online learning environment. Students’ written arguments, classroom discussions, and classroom observations were collected and analysed. The findings suggest that even though the two classes engaged with the same learning environment, the decisions and justifications provided by the pairs in the two classes were quite distinct. The students used the evidence from the learning environment in ways which supported their decision, and tended to ignore evidence if these contradicted their decision. Furthermore, students’ justifications support the hypothesis that their decision was based on whether they identified with the actors of the issue. Implications for research include exploring how students identify with the actors of a SSI to enable us to support them overcoming their personal narratives and becoming critical evaluators of scientific knowledge"

Online platforms have the potential to facilitate students’ engagement for independent and collaborative learning, enhance student–teacher interactions, and develop students’ technological skills. A framework is constructed to facilitate the conceptualisation of the various pedagogical approaches for learning using such online platforms – learning from and with technology is proposed. Learning from technology leans itself more towards the didactic and behaviouristic theories whereas learning with technology has its origin from the constructivism and social constructivism paradigms. In addition, both the didactic and constructivist pedagogical approaches are applicable for online learning as they could be used to achieve different outcomes depending on the learning objectives. Implicit in the findings is also the importance of the teachers’ commitment and competencies and good infrastructural and technical support in the use of technologies for teaching and learning in an educational setting"

        "Internationally, society is increasingly demanding that the relevance and practical applicability of research be made transparent. Despite intentions to the contrary, insights on pedagogically appropriate uses of educational technology for representative teachers in everyday school settings are severely limited. In part, this is because (design) research is often conducted at the bleeding edge of what is technologically possible -- exploring innovative uses of new and emerging technologies. There is no disputing that such work is greatly needed to seek out new ways to potentially enhance the quality of teaching and learning. However, in the excitement of exploring what is possible, tomorrow, insufficient research and development work focuses on what is practical, today. This leaves a problematic gap between what could be effective technology-enhanced learning (TEL) in theory, and what can be effective TEL in practice. This paper calls for designers/researchers of TEL to devote attention to not only fine-grained issues of pupil learning and instruction but also to broader factors that determine if and how innovations are understood, adopted and used by teachers and schools, by designing innovations to align with their zone of proximal implementation. Methodological considerations are given for designing and studying interventions that are prone to implementation by being: value-added, clear, harmonious and tolerant. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "Introduction: The Brazilian public health system requires competent professionals sensitive to the needs of the population. The Foundation for Advancement of International Medical Education and Research (FAIMER) provides a two-year faculty development programme for health professions educators, aiming to build leadership in education to improve health. A partnership with governmental initiatives and FAIMER was established for meeting these needs. This paper describes the initial process evaluation results of the Brazilian FAIMER Institute Fellowship (FAIMER BR). Methods: Data were analysed for the classes 2007-2010 regarding: application processes; innovation project themes; retrospective post-pre self-ratings of knowledge acquisition; and professional development portfolios. Results: Seventeen of 26 Brazilian states were represented among 98 Fellows, predominantly from public medical schools (75.5%) and schools awarded Ministry of Health grants to align education with public health services (89.8%). One-third (n = 32) of Fellows' innovation projects were related to these grants. Significant increases occurred in all topic subscales on self-report of knowledge acquisition (effect sizes, 1.21-2.77). In the follow up questionnaire, 63% of Fellows reported that their projects were incorporated into the curriculum or institutional policies. The majority reported that the programme deepened their knowledge (98%), provided new ideas about medical education (90%) and provided skills for conflict management (63%). One-half of the Fellows reported sustained benefits from the programme listserv and other communications, including breadth of expertise, establishment of research collaboration and receiving emotional support. Conclusion: Contributors to initial programme success included alignment of curriculum with governmental initiatives, curriculum design merging educational technology, leadership and management skills and central role of an innovation educational project responding to local needs.

        "; Currently, the use of information and communication technologies (ICT) in education does not conclusively demonstrate significant effects on learning. However, not all ICT usage models are designed to affect student outcomes. Therefore, to accurately study the impact of ICT, the concept of an educational programme supported by ICT must first be defined. The authors propose the ICT for Education (ICT4E) programme, an evidence-based framework to determine a model’s ability to produce improvements before having to evaluate its results. The framework has four components: implementation, intervention, transference and total cost. Based on an explicit definition of the outcomes pursued by a given programme, this framework supports the design of its activities to promote sustainable changes in pedagogical practices in schools and calculate the programme’s total cost. The authors illustrate this with a programme implemented in six countries. In Chile, the ICT4E programme forms part of the policy for educational technology, evaluating the effectiveness and scalability of such initiatives"

        "; This paper describes a longitudinal study, in which the interaction between junior high school principals and science teachers is characterized, and its influence on technology implementation is explored. Fourteen principals and 19 teachers who participated in a former study, which took place from 1998 to 2001, were re-interviewed and observed during 2005. The teachers were classified into four types—Initiators, Followers, Evaders and Objectors—based on the mode and extent to which they implemented educational technologies in their teaching. Principals were also classified into four categories—Initiating, Empowering, Permitting yet Preventing and Resisting—based on the way they motivated or discouraged science teachers to incorporate educational technologies into their teaching. Findings indicate that the principals were fairly consistent in the type of support they provided to their teachers throughout the seven years of the study. The findings indicate that the principals' longitudinal support or discouragement plays a crucial role in teachers' ability and motivation to incorporate educational technologies as an integral part of their teaching. Encouraging outcomes show that teachers between the years 2001 to 2005 were somewhat less dependent on the principals' support than they were between the years 1998 to 2001"

        "; The aim of the present paper is to examine the observed differences in Students' test performance across public and private-voucher schools in Spain. For this purpose, we explicitly consider that education is a multi-input multi-output production process subject to inefficient behaviors, which can be identified at student level using a parametric stochastic distance function approach. The empirical application of this model, based on Spanish data from the Programme for International Student Assessment implemented by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development in 2003, allows us to identify different aspects of the underlying educational technology. Among other things, the results provide insights into how student background, peer group, school characteristics and personal circumstances interact with educational outputs. Moreover, our findings suggest that, once educational inputs and potential bias due to school choice endogeneity are taken into account, no further unexplained difference remains between students' efficiency levels across public and private-voucher schools"

        "; Educational technology research has been characterised as lacking theoretical frameworks that can enable cumulative knowledge-building across the field. This article explores the value of Legitimation Code Theory (LCT) for addressing these issues by discussing research into the key of integration of information and communication technologies in education. Specifically, it shows how LCT enables the theorisation of knowledge practices, the basis of education but undertheorised by existing research. Drawing on a major study of a technological initiative in all state secondary schools in New South Wales, Australia, the article illustratively uses one dimension of LCT to compare the organising principles underlying the initiative with those underlying the key subjects of mathematics and English. Analysis suggests that a ‘code clash’ with mathematics and a ‘code match’ with English might help explain their different patterns of integration of information and communication technologies. It also demonstrates how LCT can be utilised with multiple methods, enabling the integration of research into a wide range of educational topics and thereby contributing towards building knowledge across the field"

Portfolios serve as continuous student progress assessment from programme entry to exit, evaluation of each student's understanding and application of Interstate School Leaders Licensure Consortium (ISLLC) and National Educational Technology Standards-A and linkage of theoretical knowledge to field-based projects. Continuing pressure on institutions of higher education to demonstrate student growth and achievement for accreditation purposes make inquiries such as this timely. Results from the study reveal that students in the principal preparation programme are better able to show mastery of the six ISLLC standards at the programme conclusion than at the midpoint. Further, results reveal a change in student perceptions of the principalship from that of organizational leader to that of visionary and instructional leader at the conclusion of the programme"

        "• Develop and implement a WebQuest-based critical-thinking programme. • Students engaged in explicit reasoning. • Students used exploratory talk as a dialogic tool in exercising critical thinking. • Pedagogical implications for the use of educational technology for critical-thinking cultivation. This article reports the findings of an exploratory study involving the development and implementation of a WebQuest-based critical-thinking programme in Hong Kong primary English classrooms. Using 'design research' as its methodological framework, the study investigated the critical-thinking performance of 125 primary school students. Sociocultural discourse analysis of classroom dialogue during programme implementation revealed the participating students to have engaged in explicit reasoning and used 'exploratory talk' as a dialogic tool in exercising critical thinking. The study has profound implications for pedagogical practice with respect to the use of educational technology for critical-thinking cultivation. This article thus makes significant contributions to the WebQuest and critical-thinking literature, extending it to the Hong Kong language education context and beyond. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "• We propose an extended technology acceptance model (TAM). • Self-efficacy positively predicted perceived usefulness (PU) and ease of use (PEOU). • Technology anxiety negatively predicted PU and PEOU. • PEOU had no direct effect on students' attitude towards using tablet computers. • Family support contributed positively to all intrinsic variables of TAM. This study proposed an extended technology acceptance model (TAM) to examine students' intention to use tablet computers in K12 settings. The participants were 347 middle school students who were engaged in a tablet-based instructional initiative. We used the partial least squares (PLS) approach to test the relationships between perceived usefulness (PU), perceived ease of use (PEOU), attitude, intention to use, self-efficacy, technology anxiety, and family support. The results suggested that the extended TAM offered a good explanation of tablet computers acceptance of K12 students. Findings from this research not only inform the successful practice of educational technology initiatives but also lay the foundation for future research. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "; The widespread availability of the internet and development of online learning technology has seen electronic learning become a key part of medical education. This study examines the current situation in the delivery of e-learning solely to final year medical students by UK medical schools. A total of 25 UK medical schools were surveyed with responses received from 21. Seventy-one percent of respondents provided e-learning to final year students (15/21). Requirements for this form of educational delivery are likely to increase but further analysis of their use is required."

        "The first direct observation of gravitational waves in 2015 has led to an increased public interest in topics of general relativity (GR) and astronomy. Physics teachers and educators respond to this interest by introducing modern ideas of gravity and spacetime to high school students. Doing so, they face the challenge of finding suitable models that visualise gravity as the geometry of curved spacetime. Most models of GR, such as the popular rubber sheet model, only address spatial curvature. Yet, according to Albert Einstein, gravitational phenomena stem from deformations both in space and time. This paper presents a new model that builds on a relativistic generalisation of Newton’s first law. We use Einstein’s free fall thought experiment and a classical height-time diagram to explain how warped time gives rise to gravity. Our warped-time model acts as a convenient supplement to the rubber sheet model. To support teachers in integrating the model into their classroom practice, we have implemented the model as an interactive simulation that is freely accessible. The model is the result of a three-year period of developing and trialling digital learning resources in Norwegian high schools. Based on these trials, we suggest specific instructional strategies on how to use the warped-time model successfully in science classrooms. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "; Aim: Medical educators should promote the development of student clinical reasoning toward independence in clinical settings. The objective of this study was to evaluate an online problem-based learning (e-PBL) model designed to promote student individual reasoning in supplement to traditional PBL. Methods: Twelve e-PBL modules were added to the fully problem-based curriculum for Year 2 at Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine (SKKUSOM). In this e-PBL, students worked on the problems individually in an online setting, followed by face-to-face discussions in a colloquium. The cases were presented using interactive multimedia to enhance the authenticity of the case and stimulate student interest in learning. A formative evaluation study was conducted to determine student satisfaction with e-PBL and its effectiveness as perceived by the students using both quantitative and qualitative methods. A cohort of Year 2 students at SKKUSOM (n = 38) took part in this study. Results: Students perceived e-PBL significantly more positively after they had taken a module in terms of its ability to foster problem-solving skills and its ability to allow them to learn in ways suited to individual learning styles. Additionally, student survey and interview revealed that a vast majority of students were satisfied with the overall learning process in e-PBL and perceived it positively in fostering knowledge acquisition and clinical reasoning. Moreover, students found the cases realistic and engaging. Conclusions: The results show the potential of e-PBL to enhance traditional PBL by promoting the development of individual reasoning in a flexible online-learning environment and offering cases in an interactive multimedia format, which warrants further investigation into its impact on student learning outcomes"

        "This book looks at the impact of digital technologies on the teaching and learning of mathematics. The focus is on learning at school and most of the twenty-nine invited contributions are drawn from England and the US. Mathematics education with digital technology will be of interest to school teachers, teacher-educators and educational technologists. If it is likely to be relevant to you, I recommend that you borrow a copy for a while. Pete Cannell [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",
