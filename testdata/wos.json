        "The purpose of this study is to analyze the content features of educational technology curricula for primary education developed by national governments. A qualitative cross-case document analysis of the national educational technology curriculum of Norway, Flanders and England was conducted. The analysis focuses on the underlying visions, specific aims and instruction related aspects that are integrated in the national educational technology curricula of the three cases under investigation. The results indicate that specific aims mainly focus on the critical use of educational technology; safe and responsible use of educational technology; information retrieval, processing and production; communication by use of educational technology; and use of educational technology for subject learning. It is possible that a discrepancy exists between the concepts of digital literacy and the specific aims that are addressed in educational technology curricula. Moreover, the rationales that underlie educational technology curricula represent a catalytic and social point of view rather than an economic one. The implications of our findings for curriculum developers and researchers are discussed."

        "The purpose of this study was to examine the relationships between personality types and vocational choices in terms of educational technology undergraduates and postgraduates in China. A valid sample of 209 undergraduates and 194 postgraduates responded to the research instrument, including 8 items about vocational choices and the Personal Globe Inventory-Short which was employed to measure personality types. The important findings included: (1) the three-letter personality code of both educational technology undergraduates and postgraduates was identified as SAE (i.e., Social, Artistic and Enterprising); (2) significant differences were found between educational technology undergraduates and postgraduates in terms of several vocational choices, and undergraduates showed lower major persistence than postgraduates; (3) realistic personality type was found to be significant positive predictor of most of the vocational choices of educational technology undergraduates; (4) educational technology postgraduates who are interested in realistic activities showed little interests in educational technology, whereas the social personality type express much interests. Finally, several suggestions have been provided for undergraduates, postgraduates, academic advisor, and high school students who choose and intend to choose educational technology as academic major."

        "Though the process of qualitative analytical research, historical analysis is applied to evaluate the degree to which public K-12 school districts in Central New York are transparently reporting information regarding their educational technology and whether this process of communication aligns with a literature-based framework for educational technology life-cycle efficacy. Through digital artifact analysis of 10 educational school districts, which account for roughly 52,000 students and annual budget allocations of $840 million, the authors conclude that this sample of school districts were not transparently communicating information pertaining to educational technology and their life-cycle efficacy was not being communicated in accordance with best-practices acknowledged in relevant literature."

        "Even though the recent influx of tablets in primary education goes together with the vision that educational technology empowered with learning analytics will revolutionize education, empirical results supporting this claim are scares. Adaptive educational technology Snappet combines extracted and embedded learning analytics daily in classrooms. While students make exercises on the tablet this technology displays real-time data of learner performance in a teacher dashboard (extracted analytics). At the same time, learner performance is used to adaptively adjust exercises to students' progress (embedded analytics). This quasi-experimental study compares the development of students' arithmetic skills over one schoolyear (grade 2 and 4) in a traditional paper based setting to learning with the adaptive educational technology Snappet. The results indicate that students in the Snappet condition make significantly more progress on arithmetic skills in grade 4. Moreover, in this grade students with a high ability level, benefit the most from working with this adaptive educational technology. Overall the development pattern of students with different abilities was more divergent in the AET condition compared to the control condition. These results indicate that adaptive educational technologies combining extracted and embedded learning analytics are indeed creating new education scenarios that contribute to personalized learning in primary education."

        "This mixed-method study investigated how primary school mathematics teachers in South Africa and Germany utilise educational technology. The perceptions of the principals and teachers regarding the use of educational technology and the obstacles to its integration were contrasted. In addition, the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) 2019 data from these countries were used to evaluate the relationship between educational technology and learner accomplishment. The results showed that teachers from both nations employed educational technology as a presentation-, reinforcement-, supplement-, and problem-solving tool, and also used it to stimulate the learning environment, as shown through semi-structured interviews and classroom observations. In addition, obstacles such as a lack of tablets/computers, technical support, and a lack of relevant continuous professional development impeded the incorporation of educational technology in mathematics by these teachers. Additionally, multi-level models revealed that access to a computer and internet connectivity at home correlated positively with German learners' mathematics performances, while no statistically significant relationship was observed in South Africa. The results of this study have policy implications and are discussed at the end of this paper."

        "One of the most dominant features of a classroom space is its high occupancy, which results in high internal heat gain which reaches up to approximately 5 KW. Furthermore, installation of educational technologies, such as smart boards, projectors and computers in the spaces increases potential internal heat gain. Previous studies on office buildings indicate that with the introduction of IT equipment in spaces during the last decade, cooling load demands are increasing with an associated increase in summer electrical demand. Due to the fact that educational technologies in specific correspond to pedagogical practices within the space, a lot of variations due to occupancy patterns occur[1]. Also, thermal loads caused by educational technologies are expected to be dependent on spatial configuration. This study explores the thermal impact of educational technologies in 2 typical educational spaces in a facility of higher education; a typical classroom and computer lab. The results indicate that a heat gain ranging between 0.06 and 0.095 KWh/m2 is generated in the rooms when educational technologies are in use. The study also investigates thermal zones within the rooms due to distribution of educational technologies. Through simulation of thermal performance of the rooms, the thermal impact of locating educational technologies in such rooms have been studied. Results show that thermal heat gain through fenestration and openings in this climatic zone are higher than internal heat gain through educational technologies."

Attitudes towards Educational Technology Scale was used to collect the data. Data was analyzed by SPSS 17.0 package program. Descriptive statistics, t-test, ANOVA and Pearson's correlation analysis were used to examine the data. There was not any significant difference for attitudes towards educational technologies' points according to gender, administrative position, academic title and education status. Correlation analysis revealed a negative significant correlation between age and attitudes towards educational technology. Findings of this research showed that points of attitudes towards educational technologies were related to age. It could be concluded that age is a determinant for attitudes towards educational technologies. Attitudes towards educational technologies get negative as academics get older (r = 0.908, p < 0.05) Results were discussed according to the relevant literature and some recommendations were made."

In this study, the effect of the health-saving educational technologies program applied to secondary school students in increasing their physical fitness, self-efficacy in sports and mental endurance in reducing negative nutritional behaviors was examined. In the study, experimental procedures were carried out according to the 2x2 control group, pretest and posttest trial model. Experimental applications of the study lasted for 10 weeks, with 33 experimental and 33 control group students. During this period, the health-saving educational technologies program was applied in the experimental group; on the other hand, no application was made in the control group. Before and after the experimental procedure, pretests and posttests were applied to the experimental and control groups (Physical Fitness Test, Sports Self-Efficacy Scale, Negative Eating Behavior Scale and Mental Endurance Scale). According to the research findings, the students in the experimental group, who applied the health-saving educational technologies program, achieved higher levels of physical fitness, sports self -efficacy and mental endurance than their peers in the control group. It has also been found that the health-saving educational technologies program is effective in reducing negative eating behaviors."

        "Neoliberal discourses have come to exert a powerful influence on contemporary education policies and practices across the globe, often in the form of such market-based reform measures as standardized assessment regimes, charter schools, and voucher programs. There is concern among some scholars that such neoliberal reforms rely heavily on information and communications technologies for their propagation and maintenance under the guise of educational technologies, or edtech. The purpose of this literature review is to examine educational research on the role that information and communications technologies have played in the neoliberalization of education across the globe. In particular, I describe how researchers have made the concept of neoliberalism intelligible by deploying it as a phenomenon for inquiry in relation to educational technologies. I argue that future inquiry must substantiate the broad claims about the effects of neoliberalized educational technologies by engaging more directly with those most affected: teachers and students."

        "This academic research explores the transformative potential of educational technology platforms, including virtual reality, gamification, and artificial intelligence, in revolutionizing the education sector. Existing literature has indicated that educational technology holds the promise of enhancing cognitive and communicative skills among university students. However, a research gap exists, as previous studies have primarily concentrated on school children, leaving a dearth of empirical evidence in this specific context. To address this gap, our current study conducted a comprehensive survey of 305 university students in Saudi Arabia. Employing quantitative methods, we assessed the impact of educational technology on university students' cognitive and communication skills, yielding noteworthy findings. The results revealed a significant positive influence of educational technology on both cognitive (p-value 0.016) and communication skills (p value 0.014) among university students in Saudi Arabia. This research significantly contributes to the existing literature by highlighting the importance of educational technology's accessibility and effective utilization in fostering the development of university students' cognitive and communication abilities. Furthermore, it sheds light on the implications of these findings for Saudi Arabia, a nation that has made considerable investments in educational technology and the accreditation of academic programs at its universities. Additionally, the study's outcomes suggest that educational technology can play a crucial role in facilitating the accreditation of academic programs in Saudi Arabian universities through its positive impact on university students' cognitive and communicative capabilities. This insight holds the potential to further advance the educational landscape in the country and beyond, emphasizing the need for continued integration and optimal utilization of educational technology in higher education settings.& COPY; 2023 The Authors.

        "The present review examines research on the effects of educational technology applications on mathematics achievement in K-12 classrooms. Unlike previous reviews, this review applies consistent inclusion standards to focus on studies that met high methodological standards. In addition, methodological and substantive features of the studies are investigated to examine the relationship between educational technology applications and study features. A total of 74 qualified studies were included in our final analysis with a total sample size of 56,886 K-12 students: 45 elementary studies (N = 31,555) and 29 secondary studies (N = 25,331). Consistent with the more recent reviews, the findings suggest that educational technology applications generally produced a positive, though modest, effect (ES = +0.15) in comparison to traditional methods. However, the effects may vary by educational technology type. Among the three types of educational technology applications, supplemental CAI had the largest effect with an effect size of +0.18. The other two interventions, computer-management learning and comprehensive programs, had a much smaller effect size, +0.08 and +0.07, respectively. Differential impacts by various study and methodological features are also discussed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

From a historical perspective, each technological breakthrough has affected education by changing how symbols are represented and how knowledge is carried. The emergence of new educational technology is always accompanied by doubt, vigilance, and rejection from the traditional community. The new educational technology, generative artificial intelligence, interacts with the old, creating an increasingly complex ecology of educational technology. Three suggestions are proposed for adjusting the education system: first, promoting small-scale, individualized, and conversational teaching in schools; second, developing teachers' and students' digital literacy in a multi-curricula system; and third, conducting research on grading and classification standards for the application of AI in education."

While computer use at home showed a tendency for positive correlations with test scores, computer use in schools did not. Following a different approach, the study reanalyzes PISA 2012 data by combining frequency of use and positive perceptions with regard to educational technology as predictors for student test scores. When controlling for influential sociodemographic factors, results indicate that positive attitudes toward educational technology are associated with higher test scores in the large majority of countries. As positive attitudes are likely to be a result of positive experiences, it seems reasonable to conclude that it might be quality instead of quantity of educational technology use that matters."

That is, we theorise the educational technologist as responsible for the orchestration of educational and technical resources, namely tools, either to attenuate systemic variety or amplify regulative variety at a certain level of recursion. To do so, we carried out a single case study that focused on the work of the educational technologist in a Music College. The educational technologist provided support to an accordion teacher and his student in remote music lessons. We collected qualitative data from the practice of the educational technologist and the experience of both the teacher and the student over six months (mainly observations and interviews) and we analyzed them building on research from managerial cybernetics, in particular, Stafford Beer's Viable System Model (VSM). Our case study indicates that, depending on the context, the educational technologist may overtake many roles, such as be a designer, technician, researcher, planner and so on. But the central role is that of handling variety in order to avoid disruption that could potentially affect the lesson negatively."

Moreover, this study also aims to identify lecturer's perception towards the usage of the educational technology. Barriers that have been identified can be categorized into lecturers' computer self-efficacy; accessibility of the educational technology; technical support in utilizing the educational technology; and support from administration. A structured questionnaire was distributed to all lecturers in the institution and 72% from the lecturers agreed to participate as respondents. The result from this study found that the lecturers in the community college have positive perceptions that educational technology enhances their teaching practices and students' performance. Ranks of the barriers from the higher mean score that have been identified are technical support, administrator support, computer self-efficacy and accessibility. Analysis found that lecturers of the community college are ready to utilize the educational technology in their teaching practice. However, the technical supports need to be enhancing Internet and computer facilities. Institution also recommended to provide more training for lecturers to sharpened their teaching skills by utilizing the educational technology. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Semi-structured interviews were conducted with two school leaders and three Grade 5 mathematics teachers from two smart schools, one in Gauteng and the other in the Western Cape Province, which were conveniently and purposefully selected. Additionally, one mathematics lesson was observed at each of these schools. To analyze the responses from interviews, content analyses were used. Findings showed that facilitating conditions such as adequate technological infrastructure and qualified information technology technicians influenced the actual teacher use of educational technology in mathematics instruction. However, social influence had the largest impact on these teachers' integration of educational technology in mathematics education. Implications for practice are discussed."

        "The current educational technologies in developing countries are not always successfully implemented and utilized due to infrastructure limitations, such as limited resources, limited training in educational technologies, and the unrealized potential usefulness of these technologies. Using an effective and relevant educational technology will efficiently maximize the use of the limited resources available to schools in developing countries in order to provide a larger outreach and increase access to up-to-date information and useful electronic resources. Thus, the authors propose TrimCloud as an alternative educational technology to help rebuild the education system and encourage innovation and development in developing countries. TrimCloud is an open-source virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) that is offered as a software-as-a-service (SaaS) and a desktop-as-a-service (DaaS). In this paper, the authors examine possible solutions to issues plaguing the educational environment in developing countries by using TrimCloud at the primary, secondary, university/higher education, and administration levels. They propose the use of refurbished legacy systems as the alternative hardware source for using TrimCloud as an educational technology, which will also aid to alleviate the \"e-waste dump\" problem. Lastly, the authors explore further network enhancements to TrimCloud that will provide a reliable and robust option for developing countries."

        "In accordance with the 2030 Sustainable Development Goal for Education, to promote equitable access and inclusive education for all, it is critical to explore if educational technologies can be used effectively by children with Special Educational Needs and Disabilities (SEND). It has been argued that educational technologies need to be tailored to the individual needs of children with SEND, otherwise they can create new layers of exclusion at school. The aim of this study was to examine the suitability of an interactive, personalised, educational technology, designed to support the learning of foundational skills, that is being introduced in several countries worldwide, for use by children with SEND. A participatory formative evaluation was conducted with ten academic experts in SEND. Each expert interacted with the technology individually, then gave written feedback through a semi-structured review form, before engaging with the other experts in an online group discussion. Qualitative data were analysed by reflexive thematic analysis. Six themes emerged pertaining to the strengths of the educational technology and areas of weakness where improvements are needed to support children with vision impairment, hearing, and functional difficulties through recommended hardware, and software updates, and by considering how the technology could be used to boost children's motivation, and the role of the teacher in supporting children with SEND to use the technology effectively. Implications for instructional design decisions, based on research evidence, are considered for promoting equitable access and inclusive education for children with SEND through technology-supported personalised learning platforms."

        "Educational disparity has been a long-standing social and political concern, and is a grand challenge for social work because of its implications for equal opportunity and social justice. As stewards of social justice in public K-12 educational settings, school social workers help students gain access to and effectively use resources and support necessary to maximize their potential in the educational process as well as identify areas of need that are not being addressed by the local education agency and community, and working to create services that address those needs. Several studies have applied educational technology interventions to address academic achievement equity issues and found improved performance on state test scores. Thus, 12 evaluation studies of educational technology in primary and secondary schools in the United States conducted after 2001 were synthesized, examining the impact of educational technology applications on student academic achievement. Although much of the research conducted emphasizes a positive correlation between these variables, not all approaches of using educational technology resulted in equally good performance, and not all students learning with educational technology learned better than those learning without educational technology under all conditions. This critique identifies both strengths and weaknesses of existing literature; suggests research priorities; and outlines specific implications for educators, policymakers, and school social workers."

Seven of the articles included computer-aided instruction, 4 utilized human-patient simulation, 1 used both computer-aided instruction and human-patient simulation, and 7 utilized virtual patients. Educational technology was employed with more than 2700 students at 12 colleges and schools of pharmacy in courses including pharmacotherapeutics, skills and patient care laboratories, drug diversion, and advanced pharmacy practice experience (APPE) orientation. Students who learned by means of human-patient simulation and virtual patients reported enjoying the learning activity, whereas the results with computer-aided instruction were mixed. Moreover, the effect on learning was significant in the human-patient simulation and virtual patient studies, while conflicting data emerged on the effectiveness of computer-aided instruction."

        "Computers and the Internet are widely recognized as fundamental to academic and future success on both the individual and the societal level. Moreover, the academic success of school-age children is now increasingly tied to access to educational technology, a reality that became even more apparent during the pandemic. While academic performance is viewed as the major outcome of using educational technology, this study looks at a crucial early stage in the educational technology value chain, specifically; 1) to what extent do students use computers and the Internet in their homes and at school and 2) what is the extent and nature of disparities in student access to educational technology. This study was conducted using the national CPS 2019 Computer and Internet Use Survey of 23,064 school age children. We used bivariate tables and multivariate logistic regression analysis to analyze the data. Results indicate that substantial disparities in the use of educational technology exist in the U.S. Overall, 28.0% of school age children reported they did not use the Internet at school or at home and another 22.8% reported using the Internet at home but not at school. Significantly, individual and community demographic characteristics and household and school technology resources contribute to these disparities. It is clear that if fundamental educational technology and the resources needed to effectively achieve academic success are unavailable in the home, then they must be provided in schools. Without educational technology and resources, the societal value added through growing use of this technology will not materialize for our students. We conclude that committing to increasing educational technology resources in the schools will have multiple future societal benefits and improve the effectiveness of the educational technology value chain."

        "This article resorts to critical pedagogy as a counterpoint to the disquieting directions that the uncritical standardization of educational technologies has produced. To do so, it starts from the following research question: how does the emancipatory use of educational technologies become possible, in a critical and counter-hegemonic way, preserving the teaching autonomy and the collective knowledge of the school institution? For the research that underlies this text, we sought to analyze a project created and implemented in the Baixada Fluminense, Rio de Janeiro, under the name of PIE: Portal da Informatica Educativa. This project, carried out through listening, dialogues and pedagogical monitoring, sought to meet the demands of the school community during the pandemic period. In this perspective, this article aims to carry out a critical analysis of the use of industrialized educational technologies, whose main objective is to act as management instruments, incorporating hegemonic approaches that restrict teachers' autonomy and neglect school subjects. It will also be discussed how these technologies contribute to the colonization of education. As a theoretical basis, the critical theory of technology proposed by Feenberg was sought, as well as authors of critical pedagogy such as Franco, Apple and Giroux. In contrast to the neoliberal context, a pedagogical practice was investigated that started from the collective construction of teaching practices, which were concerned with emancipatory practices in the field of educational technologies carried out during the pandemic period in municipal schools in Baixada Fluminense, in Rio de Janeiro."

        "In the spring of 2020, universities worldwide closed their campuses and transitioned their face-to-face courses to remote teaching with educational technologies due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This unprecedented transition to online instruction created a unique learning environment for students and faculty. Our case-based, qualitative study explores the perceived skill level changes of professors who implemented (with minimal training) online educational technologies to deliver business courses at a business school in the southwest United States. Business faculty completed a Likert-scale survey instrument that used the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization's (UNESCO) teacher competency framework, which includes digitally communicating with students, delivering asynchronous material, delivering synchronous classes, using the learning management system, and providing digital assessments and feedback (2018). Study outcomes indicate that instructors' perceived skill sets in most topics grew due to the adoption of online educational technologies at the onset of the pandemic. Further study might focus on determining the long-term implications of the growing integration of educational technology on business faculty instruction in both online and face-to-face classrooms."

They affect most sectors of human activities including education and the ability to use them effectively is a necessity for almost everyone in today's information society. Focusing on foreign languages, educational technologies represent a huge benefit to both foreign language teachers and students on a variety of aspects, such as activation and motivation of students, facilitation of the work of teachers and students, and many others. In spite of that, although most educational institutions are adequately equipped with educational technologies there are still certain reasons why these technologies remain beyond the interest of some teachers. The paper focuses on awareness and attitudes of foreign language teachers to using educational technologies in their lessons. Namely, the aim is to analyse the effectiveness of integration of educational technologies in teaching foreign languages as perceived subjectively by the target group consisting of language teachers of selected secondary vocational schools and grammar schools in the Czech Republic. A questionnaire is used as the tool for the survey. The data are analysed and processed using quantitative methods."

Data were obtained using a validated, Web-based survey instrument designed to evaluate the frequency of use and impact on learning of various technologies used in educating first-, second-, and third-year student pharmacists. Basic demographic data also were collected and analyzed. Results. The majority (89.4%) of the 179 respondents were comfortable with the technology used in the academic program. The most frequently used technologies for educational purposes were in class electronic presentations, course materials posted on the school Web site, and e-mail. The technologies cited as having the most beneficial impact on learning were course materials posted on the Web site and in-class electronic presentations, and those cited as most detrimental were video-teleconferencing and online testing. Compared to the course textbook, students reported more frequent use of technologies such as electronic course materials, presentations, digital lecture recordings, e-mail, and hand-held devices. Conclusions. Because students' opinions of educational technologies varied, colleges and schools should incorporate educational technologies that students frequently use and that positively impact learning."

In this paper, first, we interviewed 18 school officials and IT personnel to understand what educational technologies districts use and how they manage student privacy and security around these technologies. Second, to determine if these educational technologies are frequently endorsed across United States (US) public schools, we compiled a list of linked educational technology websites scraped from 15,573 K-12 public school/district domains and analyzed them for privacy risks. Our findings suggest that administrators lack resources to properly assess privacy and security issues around educational technologies even though they do pose potential privacy issues. Based on these findings, we make recommendations for policymakers, educators, and the CHI research community."

Structural equation models explaining the interplay of factors often suffer from high complexity and low coherence. To reduce complexity, a more robust structural equation model was built with data from a survey of 349 Swiss primary school teachers. It confirms that educational technology integration is dependent on individual teachers' readiness, which is in turn influenced by school readiness. Teacher readiness to integrate educational technology is based on perceived skills and beliefs. Facets of school readiness include educational technology resources in classrooms, perceived importance of technology integration, goal clarity, head teacher support, as well as formal and informal exchange among teachers."

        "Historically implementing, maintaining and managing educational technology has been difficult for K-12 educational systems. Consequently, opportunities for significant advances in K-12 education have often gone unrealized. With the maturation of Internet delivered services along with K-12 institutional trends, educational technologies are poised to help support the transformation K-12 education by providing student access to educational resources on an anywhere, anytime, any device basis. In addition, an emerging body of empirical research shows that when implemented systematically, technology can support a wide range of potential education innovations including inverted classrooms, peer-to-peer teaching and customized learning as well as increased academic achievement. A major public policy question is how best to insure educational technology resources reach all K-12 students in the shortest time and most equitable way possible. In response, this paper adopted an educational technology value chain model to assess potential avenues and barriers to implementing educational technology in K-12 systems. We find that a fully implemented educational technology value chain would directly benefit students, teachers, school systems and society. However, the analysis also finds that efforts to implement educational technology in K-12 systems still must overcome challenges and risks."

        "The information literacy of teachers in the 21st century, especially the application of modern educational technology, is an essential quality for teachers. Through the investigation and study on the application skills of some local colleges and universities' educational technology, this paper finds that the university teachers lack the correct understanding of the educational technology theory and application in the teaching process. The ability of applying the educational technology to assist teaching in teaching is extremely limited. The reason is that there is no effective training mode to improve their educational and technical literacy, and the training mode has not kept pace with the development of China's education informatization. Therefore, this paper proposes some new ideas for the training of local college teachers' educational technology literacy in view of the problems existing in the training of local college teachers' educational technology."

        "PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to examine how higher education students think about educational technologies they have previously used - and the implications of this understanding for their awareness of datafication and privacy issues in a postsecondary context.Design/methodology/approachThe authors conducted two surveys about students' experience with the ClassDojo platform during their secondary education. In both surveys, the authors included a question asking students to identify which ClassDojo-like platform they used in school. For this study, the authors examined responses to these screening questions, identifying the technologies that responses referred to and sorting technologies into categories.FindingsStudents identified a wide range of technologies when prompted to identify a technology similar to ClassDojo. Many responses suggested students have a broad, monolithic understanding of educational technology. This suggests the prevalence of a utilitarian tool perspective (rather than a platform perspective) that may be entrenched by the time that students reach higher education, hampering efforts to inform and educate them in that context.Originality/valueTo the best of the authors' knowledge, there are few studies of students' conflation of educational technologies in the extant literature. Furthermore, the platform perspective emphasized in this manuscript remains relatively rare in many fields associated with educational technology."

        "Background The transition to technology-mediated remote schooling during the COVID-19 pandemic represented a drastic shift in educational technologies' function in K-12 settings. This theoretical paper sought to: (1) identify key developments in technology-use during the pandemic; (2) situate current events within the Learning Sciences' evolving conceptualizations of educational technologies; and (3) outline how these developments should reframe our thinking about educational technologies. Methods The paper is structured along three sets of relations, intended to support analyses that go beyond determinist or instrumental depictions of educational technologies: education-technology, human-technology, and human-education. Findings I outline three key characteristics of educational technologies' function during the pandemic: they were central to the grammar of schooling, their use was widespread across social contexts, and was need-driven rather than innovation-driven. Contribution Accordingly, the paper suggests reorienting existing conceptualizations of educational technologies: (i) rethinking learning-avoiding the portrayal of technologies as solutions to educational problems and examining how they reshape learning; (ii) rethinking context-attending more to how socio-cultural, political, and historical features inform technological affordances; (iii) rethinking teaching-emphasizing adults' role in mediating the normative commitments underlying technology-use, particularly in light of the dominance of commercial platforms and tools."

Within feminist studies and Science and Technology Studies (STS), scholars have proposed a shift to include non-humans in what we propose to conceive as care arrangements. Drawing on Tronto's feminist ethics of care [1993. Moral Boundaries: A Political Argument for an Ethic of Care. Routledge], we investigate educational technologies as 'matters of care', facilitating and enabling different modes of care. We pay particular attention to the role that educational technologies assume in schools' care arrangements. The paper is based on a study of four school information systems in Germany. We identify how these systems can be conceived of as antagonists, intermediaries, recipients of care or means to receive care and critically reflect on how this allows us to imagine modes of care with technology in order to create good educational futures."

The purpose of the survey was to investigate the antecedents of the teachers' intention to use educational technology in the post-pandemic period. Consistent with the theory of reasoned action (TRA), attitude and subjective norm are both positively associated with respondents' behavioural intention to use educational technology within the two years following the pandemic. The subjective norm construct positively influences respondents' perceptions of the usefulness of the technology, indicating that respondents are influenced by their coworkers' opinions and the communications transmitted by the institution. Technological complexity and perceived usefulness of the technology respectively negatively and positively impact attitude, indicating that teachers perform an internal cost-benefit analysis when contemplating using educational technology. Technological complexity can also be considered an opportunity cost as it negatively impacts perceived usefulness. Lastly, facilitating conditions negatively impact technological complexity, indicating that supportive resources are important. These results should be of interest to university policymakers seeking to increase the use of educational technology."

        "Many countries have launched national educational technology policies in the past number of decades aimed at increasing technology integration in schools. This article analyses educational technology policy in Ireland from 1997 to 2017 and draws attention to an underlying economic agenda for technology integration in schools, set against a backdrop of neoliberal discourses. The study found that the challenge of integrating technology is no longer understood as simply a challenge of \"integration\" but rather as a realignment of the existing education system toward a more student-centered experience. Most recent policy also recognizes the complex and contextually bound nature of the associated change process suggesting a maturation of understanding in respect of the intersection between technology and education. The article also highlights the symbolic function of policy and the role it plays in representing the educational system in a particular light to national and international audiences. Recognizing the symbolic function of educational technology policy and the neoliberal ideology underpinning it can help identify the reasons for the apparent failures of past attempts to integrate technology in schools as well as informing future policy iterations."

This descriptive research, with a mixed approach, concludes that there is a great disparity in the curriculum of the different public universities, and that Educational Technology is not integrated in a generalised way in the contents. It also confirms the reductionist vision of ICT management in many subjects, leaving the education in an instrumental perception, without taking into account the pedagogical possibilities for integrating the resources in a didactic approach."

        "Students often feel overwhelmed by the volume and complexity of knowledge and skills required to learn. Along with this challange, educational technology has been gradually introduced in medical education to facilitate learning and improve outcomes. It became an essential part of communication, storing and transferring information, audio-visual media use and production, and knowledge sharing. Technology's role has been expanding from a mere tool of study and inquiry to an approach and integrated use in education. Its use in medical education is continuously evolving. However, the impact and optimal use of various technology applications are not clearly defined. There are multiple challenges facing educators to choose the right application for the specific educational purpose. Hence, studies and evaluation reviews are needed to inform the better-defined use of educational technology. This review aims to discuss and evaluate various educational technology applications in medical education, focusing on interactive learning during lectures. Lectures and other group learning sessions are common activities used by medical schools. Promoting interactive learning in large groups is known to be challenging. The advances in technology to facilitate communication and promote interaction is a promising adjunct for lectures interactivity."

        "Residents-as-teachers campaign started abroad during the last decade of the twentieth century. In India, though used informally for teaching of undergraduate students, residents have mostly been used for patientcare and their formal induction as teacher in Indian scenario is rare. Accordingly, not much effort has been made to train them formally in educational technologies. Teaching job requirements of residents are not the same as that of medical college faculty; as such, a program designed for medical college faculty will not prove equally effective for the residents. There is urgent need to train the residents in educational technologies for tapping their full potential as teachers and for this to happen, there must be a training module, tailor-made for the teaching-job requirements of the residents. This paper proposes such a program, after emphasizing the need of inducting residents in departmental formal teaching activities."

        "After the Sputnik shock of 1957, the United States initiated education reform, based in part on the hope that technology could facilitate efficient school learning. This development was largely driven by the confrontation between the eastern and western Blocs: on both sides of the Iron Curtain, reformists promoted educational technology for the purpose of better instruction so as to improve the performance capacity of their own societies. The first section of the article focuses on this circulation of knowledge, after which the second section, drawing on the example of Germany, argues that, due to the constellation of interests in the 1960s, substantial organisational and financial resources could be mobilised to promote educational technology. However, when support from political and pedagogical circles dwindled in the 1970s, it became detached from its previous objectives, but was pragmatically advanced in the private sector."

However, it is important to investigate the relationships among pre-service teachers' teaching beliefs, skills, and educational technology integration competencies before training pre-service teachers of all fields. Within the scope of this objective, a model was proposed to investigate the relations among pre-service teachers' epistemological beliefs, conceptions of teaching and learning (COTL), and educational technology integration competencies. As for the participants, 1499 pre-service teachers enrolled at the School of Education at Northwestern region of Turkey participated in the study. An Educational Technology Integration Competencies Scale, Epistemological Beliefs Scale, and COTL Scale, which were developed by the researchers, were utilized to collect the data. At the end of the study, it was found that there were significant relations between pre-service teachers' beliefs (epistemological beliefs and COTL) and their educational technology integration competencies, which is parallel with the findings of the studies in the literature."

        "As students are becoming exposed to ubiquitous technologies in higher education, critical questions are being posed about the extent of appropriate use and meaningful deployment of these technologies for their learning. Given that technological access and ubiquity do not necessarily guarantee effective use of technologies - especially in resource-stricken South African learning environments - these questions befit further interrogation in academic circles. Productive use of educational technologies tends to be tied to student perceptions about the relevance of technologies in their courses including their confidence in effective deployment of educational technologies. The Bourdieusian concepts of field, habitus and forms of capital as well as a Departmental Information and Communication Technology (ICT) climate survey were drawn upon to explore Computer Science and Informatics students' perceptions of specific educational technologies and barriers to their effective use in university learning contexts. Findings suggest that students rated learning management systems, lecture slides, video tutorials, e-mails and digital textbooks as the most invaluable technologies for their learning compared to other instructional technologies. They also ranked limited wireless access on campus, slow Internet connectivity, and educators' sub-optimal use of educational technologies as the main impediments to their effective appropriation of educational technologies. Implications for pedagogy include the need for educators' to extend technology use from traditional technologies to emerging Web-based technologies, explore the rationale for student underutilisation of new technologies and find new leverage points for optimising their usage."

        "Many volumes have been devoted to intuitive but misguided ideas about how learning works. This is as true in the use of educational technologies in higher education as it is in other related fields of educational research. As we (hopefully) emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic, educational technologies are poised to feature more heavily in post-secondary education into the future. There is a substantial incentive for bad actors to provide oversimplified solutions to complex problems. These neat solutions may seem attractive to sector and institutional leaders looking for solutions to the morass of wicked problems the pandemic has inflamed. The pages of this journal and others provide a venue for world-class research on the use of educational technologies in higher education. Despite this enormous volume of high-quality work, misconceptions and oversimplified notions of learning with technology persist. Much has been made of weird ideas about learning but, with higher education facing an increasingly uncertain digitally-mediated future, there is significant risk that these ideas could have a profound influence on the global higher education sector into the future."

Participatory Design (PD) approaches offer one way in which teachers can be directly involved in the design of classroom technologies, however PD processes alone fail to address the challenges of integrating technology within existing practices. In this paper we propose co-teaching as a novel form of co-design practice. We describe a two year longitudinal Co-Teaching project resulting in the development and use of three digital designs for the classroom. Using the TPACK model to guide our reflections we offer insights into the ways that co-teaching can support the design and integration of educational technologies. We suggest that co-teaching as a form of co-design practice offers a way to move teachers from passive adopters of technology to active participants in the design and integration of educational technologies."

This research aimed to investigate the teachers' acceptance of technology in the school innovation climate, to enhance the use and effectiveness of educational technology in Thai entrepreneurship and business schools. Furthermore, the conditional influence of knowledge hiding and sharing on the link between school innovation climate and educational technology has been investigated and reported. Using a longitudinal study design data were gathered from the 204 entrepreneurship teachers of six different universities in Pattani, Bangkok, and Songkla Provinces, Thailand. Based on SamrtPLS 3.3.3 analysis, results revealed that the \"school innovation climate\" positively impacts educational technology use. Additionally, knowledge hiding and sharing moderated the relationship between \"school innovation climate\" and acceptance of educational technology (actual use of educational technology, perceived usefulness, and perceived ease of educational technology). Current research attempted to bridge the gap between knowledge management and innovation theories application in entrepreneurship education. The study brings key policy implications for school leaders and practitioners and suggests several directions for future research."

However, it is important to understand the factors and conditions which have had the greatest impact on this process. This systematic review outlines 5 aspects that have been found to influence the use of educational technology in South African schools: access to technical resources; skills, training and competence; efficacy and efficiency beliefs; pedagogical compatibility; and a supportive leadership and management structure. Recommendations based on these findings are provided which can inform policy and practice."

        "Despite climate heating and rising ecological instability, environmental issues feature rarely in discussions of educational technology. Most commentators presume the continued unfettered use of digital education resources bolstered by occasional claims that emerging technologies might support the 'greening' of school and university provision. In contrast to such business-as-usual complacency, this article anticipates ongoing environmental degradation of the planet as radically upending the continued expansion of digital technologies in education. On the one hand, depletion of natural resources and energy curtailments might put paid to established 'abundant' forms of digital technology use. On the other hand, more frequent climate-related disasters might necessitate emergency forms of education for displaced and unsettled populations. As such, the article argues for a new paradigm of educational technology that is both wholly sustainable and targeted towards displaced and disadvantaged populations. The article considers a number of ways that such an 'Ed-Tech Within Limits' might be pursued - outlining fundamental shifts in thinking necessary to reorient educational technology along environmentally concerned lines."

Rapid and easy access to information, and sharing and developing it accompany situations where technology is frequently used in order to make the education process a more quality one. In this study that aims at investigating teachers' attitudes towards educational technologies with regards to their innovativeness levels, Individual Innovativeness Scale and Attitudes towards the Use of Educational Technologies Scale were used as data collecting instruments, and the survey method, one of the descriptive research designs, was utilized. Seven primary schools from different districts in Istanbul were selected through convenience sampling and the scales were applied to 68 teachers. When the results are analyzed, it can be seen that there is a significant and positive relationship between the teachers' innovativeness points and their points related to their attitudes towards the use of educational technologies. In terms of the teachers' individual innovativeness characteristics, it was observed that innovator and early adopter groups had higher points in relation to their attitudes towards the use of educational technologies. It was also found out that there was no significant relationship in relation to the teachers' attitudes towards the use of educational technologies in terms of age variable. It is also among the results that teachers under the age of 51 had lower attitude points compared to the others. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd."

This equally applies to research conducted in the field of educational technology and its application in schools and higher education. Recognising the inherent role that technology now plays in education, and the potential it has to engage students, this paper draws on a range of student engagement literature and conceptualises a provisional bioecological framework of student engagement that explicitly includes technology as one influential factor. This paper first proposes a definition of student engagement and provides an exploration of positive student engagement indicators. It then presents a bioecological framework, and the microsystemic facets of technology, teacher and curriculum are further explored in their relation to fostering student engagement. Based on this framework, implications for further theory-based research into student engagement and its relation to educational technology are discussed and recommendations for educators are given."

This work, framed within a larger project, shows the beliefs and perceptions of the students of the Primary Teacher's Degree of the University of Santiago de Compostela about the place of Educational Technology in training. The deepening in this line allows to understand the construction of the professional knowledge during the initial stage of training. It is a qualitative research that gathers data through the different courses of the degree, combining complementary qualitative techniques as stories, discussion groups and in-depth interviews. The analysis highlighted the students' beliefs in the line of Educational Technology, pointing out deficiencies in both teaching and learning processes, as well as contradictions between what was established and what was really put into practice. It clearly describes an unfavorable context to develop the changes promoted by the new proposals."

Informing participants of these data sharing risks is often only done so through text contained within a consent form. However, conceptualizations of data sharing risks and knowledge of responsible data management practices among teachers and learners may be impoverishedlimiting the effectiveness of a consent form in communicating such risks in a manner that adequately supports participants in making informed decisions about sharing their data. At two high schools participating in an educational research project involving the use of technology in the classroom, we investigate teacher and student conceptions of data sharing risks and knowledge of responsible data management practices; and introduce a communication approach that attempts to better inform educational technology research participants of such risks. Results of this study suggest that most teachers have not received formal training related to responsibly managing data; and both teachers and students see the need for such training as they come to realize that their understanding of responsible data management is underdeveloped. Thus, efforts beyond solely explaining data sharing risks in an informed consent form may be needed in educational technology research to facilitate ethical self-determination."

        "The past 40 years have been characterized by an ongoing shift in the rationale underlying the use of educational technologies - an earlier emphasis on efficiency and engagement has been overshadowed by a vision centered on educational technologies' capacity to facilitate authentic learning in the inauthentic school context. However, despite its intuitive appeal, authenticity is a vague and contestable concept that warrants further scrutiny. Accordingly, this theoretical paper sets out to offer a conceptual analysis of the various meanings of authenticity in educational discourse, and to examine how these both shape and obfuscate arguments concerning educational technologies. To do so, I identify two key ambiguities inherent in the concept of authenticity: (1) whether authenticity relies on correspondence to real-world contexts (is), or aims to tap into a deeper essence of an individual or phenomenon (ought); (2) whether authenticity is mainly viewed from a supposedly objective perspective (external), or aims to capture individuals' subjective experiences (internal). The depiction of technology as authentic, along with the conflations between its various meanings, serve to naturalize existing patterns of technology use, while obscuring the ways in which they are shaped by social, political and pedagogical considerations that should remain open to evaluation and critique."

        "Aim. In efforts to handle the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, lan-guage schools in Kenya were forced to organise a smooth transition from physical to virtual classroom by incorporating educational technologies in virtual learning and teaching processes. Such a shift was new to teachers and required additional efforts to master the peculiarities of organising virtual English classes. Thus, this study aims to explore Kenyan ESL teachers' perspectives towards the acceptance of educational technology integration in non-formal education.Methods. A qualitative approach was adopted in this study. Eleven teachers from two private foreign language schools participated in semi-structured in-depth interviews, where they answered questions based on the elements of the Technol-ogy Acceptance Model (TAM).Results. The findings showed that most teachers' approaches towards the accep- tance of educational technologies were mainly positive and they intend to integrate them in their ESL classroom. The results of the qualitative data analysis also demon-strated that age is one of those personal characteristics that might hinder teachers' willingness to adopt educational technologies while teaching ESL.Conclusions. This study also found that the variety of adopted educational technologies was not extensive. Therefore, teachers' awareness, interest, and digital competences should be further developed.Practical application. The herein presented research findings are of a signifi- cant importance for the enhancement of teachers' competences to apply educational technologies while teaching ESL in Kenya. It also has implications for the prac-tice that is relevant for ESL teachers in non-formal education as well as curriculum organisers."

        "With increasingly more educational tests being administered on computers and other digital devices, the comprehensive validity of tests has more potential to be improved. In the present investigation, 75 items were developed to measure educational technology competency (ETC) for pre-service teachers according to a framework constructed using the Delphi technique. In particular, the appropriateness of items was tested using the multitrait-multimethod (MTMM), higher-order factor model, and multidimensional item response theory (MIRT) to shape a program for developing and validating different modality items. The results were as follows: (1) There was robust convergent validity, weak discriminant validity, and an evident method effect of the items. (2) The graphic modality might explain more variance than the text and video modalities at discriminating examinees' ETC proficiencies. (3) The graphic modality was the most reliable modality among the three different modalities when assessing technology-supported teaching. Thus, this study makes a significant contribution to the design of assessments by developing and validating different modality items. The results could be generalized to some extent when items are developed based on other ETC standards."

Results from 45 interviews of decision-makers in higher education show that they engage in different types of research activities throughout the decision-making process, but that in most cases the research is lacking in methodological rigor. Externally-produced, scientifically-rigorous research was mentioned in less than 20% of interviews. Decision-makers often conduct their own internal investigations on educational technology products and strategies producing locally-relevant, but usually less-than rigorous, evidence to inform decisions about continuing use of the technology or scaling up."

        "In line with the requirements of modern society there is a continuous development and innovation in technologies which is also reflected in the field of education. Today's students are getting used to working with technologies from their early age; it may even happen that teachers can be at a disadvantage compared to them. Teachers are thus faced with different demands to keep up with time, to update and develop their technology competence to be able to use such technologies effectively in their teaching. It is therefore necessary for teachers to have an overview of the range of available educational technologies, to be interested in the methodology of their appropriate integration in the classroom, to keep up with the news and trends in this area and overall they should be able to make reasonable use of all the potential that educational technologies offer. In this context, the paper deals with the issue of what idea teachers have about the possibility of using educational technologies, and whether and how they specifically integrate them into the education process. Namely, the aim of the paper is to find out teachers' awareness of available educational technologies in general, the availability of these technologies at their workplace, the frequency of integration of educational technologies into their teaching, and possibly the barriers that are the cause of their minimal use. The target group consists of teachers of vocational subjects specializing in environmental education at selected secondary vocational schools. The method for realizing the research intention was a quantitative survey."

The purpose of the article is to form future teachers ' the level of competency development, reflecting students' willingness to adapt, adjust and use educational technologies in professional teaching activities. To do this, we checked the level of motivation of future teachers, the level of knowledge of the theoretical foundations of educational technologies, their design and implementation in professional and pedagogical activities, and the level of formation of the ability to reflect. The development of competencies reflecting the student's readiness to adapt, adjust and use educational technologies in professional pedagogical activity was carried out in a certain logical sequence, so that the student possessed versatile knowledge about educational technologies, was capable of their systematic creative application and his reflective activity was associated with self-actualization and striving for the implementation of constructive professional activities. The development process was carried out in the course of students solving research and design problems. Research activity was carried out by students in the study of the course \"Pedagogical technologies\", fundamental for future teachers of vocational training. The implementation of the projects was carried out during the development of the course \"Project Activities of a Professional Education Teacher\"."

        "A privately owned technology oriented university college in Ghana is striving to accelerate the adoption and use of educational technologies by faculty members so as to help improve teaching and learning outcomes. Given the known fact that the real value of educational technologies lies in the ability of faculty to integrate these technologies into their teaching and learning, this study conducted a survey of full-time faculty members within the institution to understand their perceptions of technology, levels of use of available technologies, and their training needs. Findings reveal that on average, faculty members have positive attitudes and dispositions toward some educational technologies, but feel incapable of integrating these technologies into their teaching activities. They also perceive the institution as not doing enough to support and motivate them to use technology effectively. This reflects in their reported low levels of usage of existing technologies such as the school's LMS, as well as their low expectations of any prospects of future educational technology initiatives. Faculty members however acknowledge that they could be more effective instructors if they were better equipped with the requisite skills for integrating various kinds of technologies into their respective curricular. These findings are discussed with the view to helping evolve best practice frameworks and strategies for supporting faculty members effectively use instructional technologies within the Ghanaian higher education context."

Method: cluster-randomized clinical trial, held in nine schools, with 99 children in the third grade of elementary school (control group = 51 and intervention group = 48). The pretest was conducted in both groups; intervention consisted in the application of the educational technology immediately after pretest to the intervention group; and the post-test was applied on the 7th and 30th days to both groups. For the analysis of children's knowledge on breastfeeding, we considered the pre- and post-test score means, using the Mann-Whitney test - for comparing the means between groups - and the Wilcoxon test - within the same group. Results: there was no statistically significant difference between the groups in the pretest. In the follow-up, when comparing the groups, there were higher means in the intervention group, on the 7th (19.68 +/- 1.788) and on the 30th (20.16 +/- 1.260) days, with statistically significant difference. Within the intervention group, there was significant increase of the means in the pretest (15.89 +/- 3.082) for the 30th day (20.16 +/- 1.260). Conclusion: such educational intervention has significantly contributed to the increase in scores of children's knowledge on breastfeeding for the intervention group."

        "In 2004, King Hamad Schools of Future Project (KHSFP) has been launched by the ministry of education at Kingdom of Bahrain with a goal of establishing a fundamental change in the way teaching and learning take place. The main objective of the project is to change the way in which students and teachers communicate, work and learn by transfer the traditional classroom into an open, interactive environment based on adopting new and more advance technologies. In fact at Kingdom of Bahrain, adopting technologies such as computers, smart board, or interactive board will increase the pressure on the schools to accommodate to these new conditions. This is because there are some schools in particular the elementary schools were only getting access to the technology and many teachers lack the required IT skills and capabilities. As a result, many efforts have been initiated to enhance the necessary skills and facilitate the functional development of the teachers. However, there is still a need to understand the teachers and student's acceptance of the new technology to cope with KHSFP. Thus, to achieve a technological enhancement of the education system, students and teachers should accept the IT as an effective tool. The current research aims at investigating the acceptance and use of the new educational technology such as computer, interactive board and smart board, by teachers and students in the schools of future at Kingdom of Bahrain. Through an extension of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), five factors that influence the behavioral intention to accept and use education technology were examined. These factors include: subjective norms, motivation, computer self efficacy, previous experiences, and computer anxiety. Moreover, previous experiences was investigated to has an indirect effect on perceive ease of use through the computer anxiety. The results show that the computer self efficacy, previous experience, and motivation are the most critical factor for accepting and use educational technology at Kingdom of Bahrain. By considering these factors and investigating other factors, Ministry of Education at Kingdom of Bahrain can enhance the acceptance and use of the new educational technology by both teachers and students among the Kingdom schools."

        "Instructors in STEM classrooms often frame students' interactions with technologies to help them learn content. For instance, in many STEM domains, instructors commonly help students translate physical 3D models into 2D drawings by prompting them to focus on (a) orienting physical 3D models and (b) generating 2D drawings. We investigate whether framing prompts that target either of these practices enhance the effectiveness of an educational technology that supports collaborative translation among multiple representations. To this end, we conducted a quasi experiment with 565 undergraduate chemistry students. All students collaboratively built physical 3D models of molecules and translated them into 2D drawings. In a business-as-usual control condition, students drew on paper, without support from an educational technology. In two experimental conditions, students drew in an educational technology that provided feedback and prompted collaboration. One condition received framing prompts to focus on physical models (model condition); another received prompts to generate intermediary drawings on paper (draw condition). Compared to the control condition, the model condition showed higher learning gains, but the draw condition showed lower learning gains. Analyses of log data showed that students made more model-based errors, and the prompts in the model condition reduced these model-based errors. However, interviews with instructors showed that they prefer drawing-focused prompts, in contrast to our results. These findings offer theoretical insights into how students learn to translate among representations. Furthermore, they yield practical recommendations for the use of educational technologies that support learning with multiple representations."

        "This paper examines the perceptions of university teachers towards the adoption and use of educational technology in their instruction. The rationale behind this adoption is that these educational innovations will improve students' motivation, will enhance their comprehension, and also will foster collaboration between peers in a classroom. The infusion of educational technology on college and university campuses for faculty use does not always result in its successful integration into either instruction, nor does it mean that the quality of education has improved. To address these issues, universities infusing technology in instruction must change their focus and rather than asking whether or not technology should be used for instruction, the focus should be on how to successfully adopt and diffuse technology for instruction to increase or improve their ability to educate using technology. The framework proposed in this paper combines the empirical data from research with the theoretical factors from the literature to create a structured process that identifies the issues to technology adoption in instruction. We use the basic principles of adoption and diffusion theory as a means to understand and explain how university teachers react when an innovation is introduced into their work environment. An empirical survey in a random selected sample of 72 university teachers who teach in several Greek Higher Education Institutions was conducted. A research questionnaire, applying a suggested modification of Technology Acceptance Model was instrumented. Also, descriptive mixed methods approach was used to develop a multivariate conceptual framework to understand the relationship between the issues and the barriers to adopting these educational technologies. Findings suggest that there is a relationship between the Higher Education Institutions maturity level of technology adoption and the level of acceptance from the teachers' point of view. This research might represent a solid background for further research into the development of a systematic process or approach for managing the adoption of technology in instruction at an institute of higher education. We conclude by considering various ways of reducing the effect of the identified barriers to support implementation of educational technologies in the university."

The educational environment used for making study materials accessible and for the computer support of the education process (learning management system, LMS) often enables recording of students' activity during their studies, work with study materials, test results, etc. The analysis of the data offers the information about students' behaviour in the eLearning environment and makes it possible to find out their usual daily or weekly study time, the actual use of study materials, etc. Extensive courses taken by large and quite heterogeneous groups of students are suitable for the analysis of students' behaviour in the eLearning environment. The \"Educational Technologies\" course is intended for the students of the \"Teaching for elementary schools\" study program. Every year, the course is taken by approximately 400 students of both full-time and part-time study. Students' behaviour is influenced by the form of study, the structure of the course, and the study materials. In the 2014/15 academic year instructional video tutorials were added to the \"Educational Technologies\" course for the first time. The paper analyses the changes in students' behaviour and actions within the scope of the \"Educational Technologies\" course related to the use of instructional video tutorials. The results are specified for both forms of study-full-time and par-time. With regard to the number of students in the course, the acquired results refer to the general principles of students' activity and behaviour in the eLearning environment."

The way Israeli decision-makers perceive the relationship between education, society, and technology, and the forces involved in shaping the policy is analyzed. Technology in education is perceived as a solution to societal and educational problems and as an unstoppable force. Efforts to implement technology in education have been made without significant awareness of the dialectical nature of technology. Two different implementation approaches compete. I illustrate the connection between the Ministry of Education's organizational structure and the nature of the implementation of national ICT curricular programs. Findings also reveal ongoing disruption regarding policy between Israel's academia, teachers' colleges, and the Ministry of Education."

Since the students are freshman and they don't have enough background about pedagogical literacy and concepts, they have some difficulties about application of this course. This paper analyzes and discusses the opinion of these freshman students about their computer courses in order to gain basic pedagogical and technological literacy. Throughout the paper, different characteristics of students such as students' graduation from different types of high schools, weighted of Student Placement Examination, ownership of computer, taking other pedagogical courses are compared with their opinions."

        "Despite the drastic change to school environments due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it is still important that educational technology researchers conduct school-based research to understand the impact of technology in an authentic learning context, even remotely. However, the transition to remote research has made it challenging for researchers to collect classroom data, observe teacher-studenttechnology interactions, and facilitate study sessions. To explore how researchers can effectively plan and conduct technology-based educational studies in the new, evolving classroom research environment, we interviewed seven US teachers, investigating their perceptions of participating in remote classroom studies. Based on the findings and the authors' experience of running classroom studies, we propose a framework that educational technology researchers can refer to when planning and conducting research in the evolving classroom research environment. Specifically, the framework informs researchers of several types of questions they can explore with teachers, students, and researchers themselves to be better prepared to address potential confusion, unexpected issues, and practical benefits in remote classroom research. Our work contributes by providing a practical guide for running technology-based research remotely, which may remain as a means of classroom research in the future. Some of the findings and the framework would also be applied to in-person classroom research setting."

        "The most valuable resource of a society that enables it to survive is human power. The education and employment of this resource not only shows the difference of a society from the others, but renders a healthy interaction within the society. This difference is only possible with education. There is yet no consensus about the concept of education. When we look at education within this framework, the factor which will provide the biggest contribution to the development of the country is the vocational, technical education. The vocational, technical education must serve the society more and more every single day in order to provide for the limitless needs of humans. Although the fact that vocational, technical education should not ultimately educate people into only one unique mold does not seem to agree to the other concepts of education, vocational improvement will only be possible with the employee who has acquired good vocational background, who can speculate the future and who can present his/her speculation with scientific research. These qualifications are only possible when the individual gets a good vocational education. The research has been applied as choosing with the simple random sampling method in Istanbul. Total of 242 students were asked about the use of educational technologies, use of information technologies, using the skills of the internee and requirements, difficulties on educational technology. It has been seen that students use educational technologies and informational technologies at basic level and not enough using the skills of the internet of students."

Consequently, it is essential to evaluate the usability of forms of educational technology and to identify their viability and suitability for medical education. The objective of the investigation was to present an assessment of the state of medical education during the COVID-19 epidemic and to identify the obstacles faced by educators while introducing online learning systems for medical students. Two cross-sectional surveys were conducted with 200 medical students and 75 staff members from Saudi Arabia's University of Health. A descriptive method was used to focus on the mechanisms of analysis, foresight, and comprehension of reality. The most significant findings were the obstacles posed by instructors' most urgent requirements for educational technology training and its applications in order to activate distance education in medical education. In addition to a detailed description of the academic and technological concerns and obstacles encountered by students and faculty of health colleges during the pandemic, this report includes a discussion of the pandemic itself. Several prospective recommendations for the use of online and blended learning in health colleges post -pandemic were also made. Additionally, the requirement to activate learning via virtual professional learning groups. (Afr J Reprod Health 2024; 28 [1]: 94-109)."

Unfortunately, this challenge of developing and maintaining technology-driven solutions in Technology for Education (T4E) community is often seen as content development and infrastructure management, and software engineering ideas are seldom applied. In this poster, we briefly summarize our experience of mining a software product line from 9 existing eLearning Systems (for adult literacy). Software Product Lines (SPL) is an interesting paradigm to improve software productivity by focusing on a family of similar but distinct products tailored to customers' needs. We then present the need for a light-weighted, integrated approach to software product lines and briefly outline Lean Software Product Lines as a preliminary research direction to address the scale and variety inherent in educational technologies domain."

Before the COVID-19 pandemic, there was already a significant use of ICT resources, especially in many post-graduate programs, whichwere offered in online or blended learning modalities. The main goals of the study were to explore students' perceptions from a Chilean vocational school (post-secondary education) and university of applied sciences, with campuses (more than 27) in all regions of Chile about the use of ICTs and educational technologies, and to know about the participants' attitudes towards the educational use of ICTs and other educational software. Based on scientific literature and their previous experience in research projects about the use of ICTs and the development of a didactical strategy to incorporate educational technologies in the learning process of engineering students, the authors developed a categories system with indicators for the instrument design. The instrument consists of a questionnaire with closed (25 items) and open-ended questions (3) organized into eight main categories with their respective items."

Using the Minnesota New Country School as a case, this study aimed to improve the selection and description of functions that educational technology should serve in the information age. Multiple mixed methods were used to collect and analyze data from the advisors (a role similar to teachers) and students. The findings identified the functions of the school's major educational technology system (Project Foundry) and revealed how the key stakeholders, including the advisors and students, used it and what suggestions they had for its improvement."

        "The predominance of western paradigms and a frequent failure to consider and theorize the non-neutrality of schools and technology leaves an ontological and epistemological gap in educational technology studies. Specifically, it leads to thin research on the role of power, the collective, and the intersections with technology that can alter our interaction with the world. The current narrow approach hobbles the imagination of the field, constraining the possibilities for technology and education. We propose three research frames that are relatively new to the field of educational technology. These frames acknowledge the interdisciplinary and socially embedded nature of technology and the systems of power that exist in both schools and technology: Collective Framing, Critical Race Theory (CRT) Framing, and Ecological Framing. We synthesize the possibilities of these approaches for educational technology research, identifying how they can push the field to consider different epistemological, ontological, and axiological approaches. We identify potential areas of research and consider implications for the field of educational technology. While each frame offers its particular theoretical contribution, taken together, all three frames suggest the sociocultural, epistemological, and political limitations of the field known as educational technology. Finally, we return to the initial wonderings of our paper, imagining the possibilities for ed tech research if the field confronted the hegemonic western paradigms embedded within itself."

        "The use of educational technology by Hong Kong primary school teachers has been realized by the government's long-term support to the technology infrastructure, professional training, technical support, and development of teaching resources in local primary schools. However, the high adoption rate may not reflect the willingness of teachers to accept technology for educational purposes. Presently, there is no existing research investigating in-service primary teachers' technology acceptance in Hong Kong. The aim of this study is to investigate teachers' acceptance of technology and the influencing factors behind their acceptance. This study takes a quantitative approach to investigate 185 primary teachers in Hong Kong using Structural Equation Modeling on a customized Technology Acceptance Model. The results suggest that contrary to common belief, perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness of the technology have little influence on behavioral intention of use in our research context. Rather, a pragmatic consideration of facilitating conditions is found to be a strong dominating factor. A context-specific interpretation of the results is provided. Implications on school policy are also discussed to provide insights for the development of educational technology."

The purpose of the article is to present the experience of using methods and means of implementing interaction technologies in higher education. The goal implies that educational technologies are one of the key elements in the preparation of students of higher schools. They allow forming professional competence of students, emphasizing the leading role of their independence, activity in the consulting role of the teacher. The analysis of the educational process with the application of modem educational technologies given in the article allowed to reveal some features in which appearance is caused by the specificity of the realization of technologies. Modem methods and means of their implementation contribute to the guaranteed achievement of educational goals, the interaction of students becomes more coherent and acquires a new, productive character. Of particular importance are educational technologies for students of pedagogical universities, as their future professional activity is directly related to the use of methods and means of their implementation. The article presents the experience of implementing interaction technologies at the University of Minin in the discipline \"Pedagogical technologies\". As practice shows, such methods as brainstorming, a round table, a case method allow you to teach students how to conduct a dialogue, develop students' interest and motivation to study the discipline, and thereby allow them to form their competence. The results of the implementation of methods and means of implementing interaction technologies showed that having an understanding of educational technologies at the initial stages of training and forming the skill of interaction under their influence throughout the training period, students have the opportunity to form professional competence and organize their professional activities at a high level."

        "The COVID-19 pandemic kick-started a new paradigm shift in the way and manner teaching and learning takes place on the global scale due to the lockdown that succeeded in shutting down school activities. As a result, most institutions turned to technology supported e-learning as against the traditional face-to-face teaching and learning in order to cover for lost time. This study therefore tested the effectiveness of game-based learning on students' performance in educational technology. Using a simple repeated measures design, 24 students participated in this study. Using an Educational Technology Achievement Test (ETAT), which was validated and pilot-tested to obtain data, the students were given two separate pre-tests before the commencement of the treatment as well as two different post-tests after the treatment. Data were computed using a mixed design repeated-measures ANOVA. Findings revealed that game-based learning significantly improved students' performance to a large extent (F-(3,F- 69) = 170.960; p < 0.05) with an effect size (eta(2)(p)) of 0.881. The study has some implications for Nigerian teachers and researchers in Educational Technology and Science-related fields on the need to incorporate game-based learning given that it has what it takes to improve students' performance."

        "The aim of this article is to explore early childhood students' views on how variations in educational technology might impact young children's learning experiences in the classroom. Initially, a meta-analysis of 33 studies was carried out in order to identify how technology is positioned in children's lives (m=4.8years), identifying two key dimensions: one, regarding aspects of children's learning and, the other, regarding their personal development. At a second stage, two online vignettes, informed by the meta-analysis findings, were completed by 45 university students studying early childhood studies (N=45). Participants' understandings of the interplay between the First Space (material space) and the Second Space (mental space based on perceptions and attitudes) were explored from the perspective of Soja's Third Space which combines both First and Second Spaces. Data show that alterations in the First Space influence participants' opinions on the relationship between technology and children's learning and development. The implications of this study reflect the complexity of educational technology in early years settings where both First and Second Spaces play a significant role and provides the opportunity to implement a spatial perspective on how practitioners can become navigators, transformers and constructors of their own technological praxis and practice."

Given that Educational Technologies are not explicitly included, Higher Education Institutions can decide whether to offer ICT training or not, contradicting the widely-held view that Educational Technologies should be an integral component of Initial Teacher Education. The goal of this paper will be to investigate how the Portuguese legal framework has had an impact on the inclusion of ICT in Initial Teacher Education. We will analyse a wide range of MA Programs currently being offered at Portuguese universities (for Initial Teacher Education in Middle and Secondary Education) and provide evidence which shows that universities are failing to provide pre-service teachers the necessary training to help them embrace Educational Technologies in their future teaching practice."

Based on the type and timing of technology use, we identify several distinct profiles of engagement, which we group into two categories: independent users who engage with technology-based educational software independently and interaction-supported users who use two-way communications to support their engagement. We also find that as the demands of families from schools increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, Spanish-speaking families were significantly more likely than English-speaking families to engage with educational technology across all categories of families, particularly as interaction-supported users."

Departing from the fact that the contemporary classroom is no longer a bounded and discrete space, the article uses ethnographic participant observation to provide thick descriptions of technologies-in-use at a Danish business college. These observations suggest that educational technologies play much more nuanced roles than hitherto imagined. Building on the notion of spatial imaginaries, the article explores two complementary patterns of spatial relations in the classroom: Educational technologies open a gateway to the world that can be used both to bring relevant information into the space of the classroom (outside-in) and to escape educational activities in favor of off-task activity (inside-out). By exploring these twin movements, this article hopes not only to provide a glimpse into the 21st-century digitized classroom but also to showcase the uneasy position of educational technology between burden and blessing."

It includes a number of stages: informative-motivational, operational, predictive, organizational and reflective. In this order the students pass the stages, i.e. get deeper understanding of innovative educational technologies applied in modern school lower grades. Each stage of the model uses educational strategies that help students to prepare to innovative activities: \"intellectual and developmental teaching\", \"Being within content\" strategy, \"simulation\", etc. Implementation of this model in Pskov State University proved its efficiency. Students that took part in the experiment showed positive dynamics in developing all components of readiness to innovative activity. The article pays special attention to the practical aspect of students' readiness."

        "In a world driven by constant change and innovation, Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) are undergoing a rapid transformation, often driven by external factors such as emerging technologies. One of the key drivers affecting the design and development of educational delivery mechanisms in HEIs is the fast pace of educational technology development which not only impacts an institution's technical capacity to infuse hardware and software solutions into existing learning infrastructure but also has implications for pedagogical practice, stakeholder acceptance of new technology, and HEI administrative structures. However, little is known about the implementation of contemporary educational technology in HEI environments, particularly as they relate to competing stakeholder perceptions of technology effectiveness in course delivery and knowledge acquisition. This review fills that gap by exploring the evidence and analyses of 46 empirical research studies focussing on technology implementation issues in a diverse range of institutional contexts, subject areas, technologies, and stakeholder profiles. This study found that the dynamic interplay of educational technology characteristics, stakeholder perceptions on the effectiveness of technology integration decisions, theoretical frameworks and models relevant to technology integration in pedagogical practices, and metrics to gauge post-implementation success are critical dimensions to creating viable pathways to effective educational technology implementation. To that end, this study proposes a framework to guide the development of sound implementation strategies that incorporates five dimensions: technology, stakeholder perceptions, academic discipline, success metrics, and theoretical frameworks. This study will benefit HEI decision-makers responsible for re-engineering complex course delivery systems to accommodate the infusion of new technologies and pedagogies in ways that will maximise their utility to students and faculty."

        "This qualitative study focuses on capturing students' understanding two visualizations often utilized by learning analytics-based educational technologies: bar graphs, and line graphs. It is framed by Achievement Goal Theory-a prominent theory of students' academic motivation-and utilizes interviews (n = 60) to investigate how students at risk of college failure interpret visualizations of their potential academic achievement. Findings suggest that visualizations only containing information about students themselves (i.e., self-focused affordances) evoked statements centered on mastering material. Visualizations containing information about students and a class average (i.e., comparative information), on the other hand, evoked responses that disheartened students and/or made them feel accountable to do better. Findings from this study suggest the following guidelines for designing visualizations for learning analytics-based educational technologies: (1) Never assume that more information is better; (2) anticipate and mitigate against potential misinterpretations-or harmful alternative interpretations-of visualizations; and (3) always suggest a way for students to improve. These guidelines help mitigate against potential unintended consequences to motivation introduced by visualizations used in learning analytics-based educational technologies."

        "As the field of K-12 data science education continues to take form, humanistic approaches to teaching and learning about data are needed. Data feminism is an approach that draws on feminist scholarship and action to humanize data and contend with the relationships between data and power. In this review paper, we draw on principles from data feminism to review 42 different educational research and design approaches that engage youth with data, many of which are educational technology intensive and bear on future data-intensive educational technology research and design projects. We describe how the projects engage students with examining power, challenging power, elevating emotion and lived experience, rethinking binaries and hierarchies, embracing pluralism, considering context, and making labour visible. In doing so, we articulate ways that current data education initiatives involve youth in thinking about issues of justice and inclusion. These projects may offer examples of varying complexity for future work to contend with and, ideally, extend in order to further realize data feminism in K-12 data science education. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Data feminism is an emergent framework for changing data practices and discourse in service of equity and justice. Data science education is rapidly growing as a topic of interest in the educational technology research and design communities. Many educational technology and design projects have been launched and shared in publications that preceded the widespread distribution of the data feminism framework. What this paper adds Data feminism is partially re-articulated in terms familiar to educational technology research communities. Prior and recent projects are organized with respect to how they illustrate potential connections to core data feminism principles. This paper identifies specific strategies that recent projects have used that have potential for realizing data feminism principles. Implications for practice and/or policy Educational technologists can use the re-articulated principles of data feminism for education to inform their future design work. Tractable steps to achieve data justice that are attainable within existing educational systems can be pursued. Communities can and should bring together multiple ways of knowing to support new educational practices and futures with data."

In this article we present two experiences based on the use of educational technologies and methodologies that have helped overcome these difficulties by bringing the PC to the Classroom effectively for students, teachers and schools. Experiences have been developed in collaboration with educational institutions and ministries of education in two Latin American countries. The educational technologies used are virtual learning environments (VLE), synchronous collaboration systems, and Scratch / Snap online programming environments. The educational methodologies developed are based on collaborative work teachers-tutors, teachers-students, and students-students. Both educational technologies and methodologies have been used together to develop, through the PC, the ability of our students to solve problems related to daily life and the working world."

        "In 2009, I conducted a case study of information and communications technologies (ICTs) or lack thereof within a school district in the Philippines. The study identified the following five themes in addition to cost. First, regional infrastructure availability is not a predictor of ICT uptake. Second, beliefs about cost may be as influential as actual cost. Third, positive attitudes towards technology are not enough. Fourth, technology uptake is inhibited by lack of ICT/pedagogical knowledge. Fifth, leadership and planning are important. In 2009, the complete report along with recommendations for how to begin to implement technology within the school district was provided to the District Superintendent. This study was presented at INTED 2010 (Melgosa, 2010). In June 2012, I conducted a follow up visit to the school district. The visit revealed that none of the 2009 study recommendations had been implemented. The school district was in the same situation as it had been three years earlier. Most of its schools still lacked ICT. No teacher training in ICT or in educational technology pedagogy had been forthcoming. This review paper seeks to explore the reasons why such studies as the 2009 study and its 2012 follow-up continually fail to produce meaningful change. It specifically looks at the underlying theory behind educational technology through the lens of developing world schools. It highlights the difficulties with implementing such pedagogy in these settings. The paper proposes that educational technology researchers who wish to make a difference in developing world contexts must seek different research methodologies. I propose a participatory research methodology as an alternative way forward for future researchers who hope that their efforts will lead to meaningful change."

The authors investigate the possibilities considering technical features of the functioning of distance learning technologies and e-learning in the legislation, as well as the conditions and problems of using distance learning technologies and e-learning in the educational process. The relevance of the problem is in improving the formation of teachers for professional activities in the context of modern tendency in the informatization of education. Professional formation is based on the inclusion of innovative activities in the educational process of a pedagogical university aimed at organizing creative informational interaction of students and teachers in the process of mastering e-learning technologies. In accordance with the new amendments in the Federal Law \"About Education\" the problem of including distance educational technologies in schools is updated. In the article, the directions of teachers' professional formation for distance learning are defined, the main models of teachers' professional formation in the field of distance educational technologies at the stage of formation at a pedagogical university and advanced formation are listed as well. But there are barriers that impede the use of distance learning technologies and e-learning in the educational process. The difference between distance educational technologies and electronic education is whether there is a direct cooperation between the teacher and the student or not. If it is carried out using information technology, technical means, we are talking about e-learning. If the interaction is mediated, through the Internet for example, then this is distance learning. An educational organization has the right to use one or both forms of implementation in their educational program. It is important to prepare future teachers for the use of distance learning technologies in professional activities in the global process of informatization and digitalization of education."

        "The paper addresses and explains some of the key questions about the use of data mining in educational technology classroom research. Two examples of use of data mining techniques, namely, association rules mining and fuzzy representations are presented, from a study conducted in Europe and another in Australia. Both of these studies examine student learning, behaviors, and experiences within computer-supported classroom activities. In the first study, the technique of association rules mining was used to understand better how learners with different cognitive types interacted with a simulation to solve a problem. Association rules mining was found to be a useful method for obtaining reliable data about learners' use of the simulation and their performance with it. The study illustrates how data mining can be used to advance educational software evaluation practices in the field of educational technology. In the second study, the technique of fuzzy representations was employed to inductively explore questionnaire data. The study provides a good example of how educational technologists can use data mining for guiding and monitoring school-based technology integration efforts. Based on the outcomes, the implications of the study are discussed in terms of the need to develop educational data mining tools that can display results, information, explanations, comments, and recommendations in meaningful ways to non-expert users in data mining. Lastly, issues related to data privacy are addressed. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

        "Introduction: Amazing technological advances in transportation, health, communication, and education continue to facilitate our lives from past to present. Considering the developmental and professional characteristics of students with special needs; It is thought that educational technologies have a very important place in enriching the learning and teaching processes in terms of gaining competence. Method: Previous studies on special education and educational technologies indexed in the Education Research Index (ERIC) database between 1960-2019 were reviewed with scientometric methods, and in this context, 22049 studies with \"Special Education\", \"Educational Technology\" labels are obtained. This study, carried out by using content analysis, is a descriptive/depictive study in terms of purpose. Findings: One of the most important findings of this study is that the word \"handicapped\" was used in the abstract parts of articles in 1980s and early 1990s. However, it was later replaced with \"disability\". Another significant finding of the study is that computers are often used as a technology tool in special education. Accordingly, it can be said that studies from past to present have been focusing on school and there is a consistency in the articles on educational programs. It is thought that the computer software used in obtaining this result has an effect considering the results on trends in real life skills related to children and teachers who also play an important role in the study Discussion: Based on the findings, it is recommended to future researchers to renew curriculum programs in this direction and arrange them by making use of technological development to include the target audience which is not only families but also teacher candidates."

        "An analysis of requests of schools (administrators and teachers) for modern technologies that a graduate of a pedagogical university should know is an urgent task of the modern system of higher pedagogical education. For current and future teachers, the technologies used in specialized classes of physical, mathematical, and technical orientation are relevant. The research is based on research articles describing the spread and impact of modern educational technologies and mentoring on the training of teachers. The results of processing answers to the questionnaire of physics teachers and methodologists from 57 general education institutions in the region are used as empirical data. The aim of the study was to determine the relevance, distribution, and composition of educational technologies used in teaching physics. Teachers' recommendations for the training of future teachers were also determined. During the empirical research, it was important to find out teachers' wishes and conditions for the mentoring of students of a pedagogical university. The research methods were: survey and statistical data processing, clustering of narrow and specific respondents' answers, generalization of results. In the course of the study, based on the analysis of foreign and domestic scientific periodical literature, analysis and clustering of teachers' responses, the increasing influence of digital learning on the training process of future teachers was revealed. This process is not only related to the need to increase the use of educational content, digital tools, and educational technologies in teaching physics at school. The need for a systematic familiarization of future teachers with the contours of the new \"digital education\", its concepts, the emerging didactics of digital learning, and the ideas of cyberpedagogy was established. The survey of teachers in the region revealed the state of the school teaching of physics, their opinions on the use of educational technologies. The ratings of educational technologies used in modern practice are determined by the categories \"traditional \" and \"innovative\". The names of educational technologies that belong to both categories were determined, which indicates the improvement of technologies and the relevance of their further application in teacher training. Recommendations of teachers on topics of final qualification works of future teachers were revealed. The wishes and conditions for the mentoring process of students by current teachers were identified. The general requirements that determine the ability of teachers to act as mentors of individual practice of students were formulated."

Findings support the view that early years practitioners are accessing a wider range of technologies and that these technologies are being used in more pedagogically appropriate ways than has previously been reported. Educational technologies appear to be increasingly embedded within early years education. Overall, attitudes towards educational technology are positive. Beliefs, however, are more likely to be linked to the social rationale, that children need access to technology because they are surrounded by it in everyday life, than the pedagogical rationale, that technology enhances learning. It may be necessary to review documentation to ensure that policy and practice focus more specifically on learning and teaching."

        "Modern educational technology plays an increasingly important role in college mathematics teaching. This paper probes into some problems as follows: how to design multimedia courseware in college mathematics teaching, how to make use of the online course, etc. The key for successes of multimedia courses is the combination of the appropriate courseware consistent with mathematics cognitive law and the traditional blackboard-writing teaching. While the design of a campus online course platform should aim at nurturing and improving the self-learning ability of students. Therefore, the online course platform should provide rich teaching material for students as well as the regular interactions between teaches and students, such as online tutoring, remote question-answering, and discussion."

In accordance with the objectives of this study, a systematic search was carried out in the Scopus database, which included high-quality scientific literature in more than 250 disciplines, including social sciences, and humanities. \"Technology and Physical Education\", followed by \"Education\" and \"School\" were the primary search terms used for the identification of studies and several health based databases were searched in English language literature in the Scopus database from 1999-2021. A total of 131 journal articles were published in the Scopus database within the time line of 1999-2021. A very low amount of literature was available relevant to technology and physical education within the timeframe of 1999 to 2009. Based on publications in the Scopus database, the findings revealed that: 1) The number of publications has increased, although there was an up-and-down trend from year to year. 2) Most of the publications were written by researchers located in several countries and universities. 3) \"Structure and content of the educational technology of managing students' healthy lifestyle\" written by Alexander & Vladislav ( 2015) was the most cited article with 46 citations. 4) Universidad de La Sabana, Colombia, was found to be the most productive institution with 5 publications. 5) The keyword with the highest number of occurrences (19) in the research sample was \"educational technology selection\"."

The participant observation and the self-evaluation questionnaire were adopted as the data production instrument in this study which had as the target audience students from the fifth year of elementary school in a public school of Rio Grande do Sul. The research was developed through pedagogical proposals interlaced with educational technologies in network specially audiovisual production. The content analysis was chosen for the data interpretation, pointing the existence of four main categories of analysis which are educational technologies in network; authorship and co-authoring; audiovisual production in school; and learning/unlearning processes. As a result, the students showed themselves as authors and co-authors of their learning processes through the audiovisual production creation process."

        "The present article is a result of an ongoing qualitative approach bibliographical research. For the development of our investigative work, we are starting from the hypothesis that the educational technology is crucial to the development of an educative work aimed at human emancipation. The study assumes that technology has always been present in everyday life at school. Its presence, however, is subsumed to the interests of the development of the capitalist society, expressing pragmatic and utilitarian knowledge, reducing the emancipatory potential of teaching work. Meanwhile, we ask ourselves: How to acquire a critical-dialectical knowledge under the social-metabolic dynamics of capitalism, that promotes, albeit as a possibility, the emancipation of sons and daughters of the working class in the context of the Brazilian public school? The preliminary results point to the fact that educational technology, although fundamental for the development of educational work aimed at human emancipation, continues to be treated in a mystifying and fetishistic way, abstractly situated in the educational scope as a recipe and remedy for complex educational problems and which can only be tackled by attacking structurally and historically determined issues."

        "The rise of technology, in the current moments, deserves the attention of the educational community. Technology is everywhere and at all times at the service of the human being, so it is necessary to find out what extent technology with this ubiquitous approach can favor the educational context. Aligned with this antecedent and considering that there is no clear evidence as to how the integration of mobile educational technology should be approached in specific subject classes, the current pilot study, was aimed to analyze the impact of integrating an educational mobile application within math classes. The present study used mixed research approach (quantitative and qualitative); participatory action research with a quasi-experimental design was combined. Three groups of secondary school students participated in the research: G1 group (30), without mobile application; G2 group (27), only with mobile application for intraclass learning; G3 group (29), with a mobile application for ubiquitous learning (intraclass and extraclass). In order to facilitate the integration of the mobile application in the planning for Skills with Performance Criteria (SPC) of Mathematics, the Substitution Augmentation Modification Redefinition (SAMR) Model was selected to analyze the pre-test and post-test data, statistical analysis was performed using one-way ANOVA and Tukey post hoc tests, this analysis was performed with SPSS Version 22 statistic software package. The results of the data sources used in the present study were triangulated. In the results, improvement in Mathematics learning was observed, mainly, in G3 group. It is concluded that the integration of mobile educational technology with a ubiquitous approach favors Mathematics learning results."

We have analyzed the metrics of school readiness among preschool age children of three social groups: kindergarden children, children from group homes, and children attending a health and fitness club. Based on the analysis of their physical activity, we have developed the framework and content for an educational technology aimed at promoting the physical, psychological and intellectual readiness to attend school in children of different social groups. Additionally, the children's physical activity routine included active game classes as well as posture and coordination exercise. The effectiveness of the developed technology has been tested through an 8-month long educational experiment. After its conclusion, children of each social group have shown improved morphofunctional development, physical fitness, and social adjustment. The metrics of children's school readiness have changed as well: 78% of kindergarden children, 83% of health and fitness club children, and 56% of group home children have demonstrated readiness for primary school education programs."

        "Remote access technology in STEM education fills dual roles as an educational tool to deliver science education (Educational Technology) and as a means to teach about technology itself (Technology Education). A five-lesson sequence was introduced to 11 and 12-year-old students at an urban school. The lesson sequences were inquiry-based, hands-on, and utilized active learning pedagogies, which have been implemented in STEM classrooms worldwide. Each lesson employed a scanning electron microscope (SEM) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) accessed remotely. Students were assessed using multiple-choice questions to ascertain (1) technology education learning gains: did students gain an understanding of how electron microscopes work? and (2) educational technology learning gains: did students gain a better understanding of lesson content through use of the electron microscope? Likert-item surveys were developed, distributed, and analyzed to established how remote access technology affected student attitudes toward science, college, and technology. Participating students had a positive increase in attitudes toward scientific technology by engaging in the lesson sequences, reported positive attitudes toward remote access experiences, and exhibited learning gains in the science behind the SEM technology they accessed remotely. These findings suggest that remote experiences are a strong form of technology education, but also that future research could explore ways to strengthen remote access as an educational technology (a tool to deliver lesson content), such as one-on-one engagement.

        "The present article aims to present a vision about the teachers' challenges and the contributions of educational technologies in the English Language teaching (EL) in the contemporary world and its implications in the school context. It demonstrates the textbook role, the Information and Communication Technologies (ICI) approach in EL teaching, evaluation and need for continuing teacher training. The methodology is based on a qualitative approach, applied through bibliographic research, which is based on authors such as: Almeida; Valente (1997), Demo (1994/2008), Freire (1997), Hoffman (2003), Libaneo (2014), Moran (2000), Perrenoud (2000) and others. The reflections point out that the difficulties of teachers in introducing these tools are due to several factors, such as: physical structure of the school environment, exhaustive teacher workload, lack of specific classroom instruction, lack of pedagogical tools as the traditional posture of teachers and managers."

        "This review examines the effectiveness of educational technology applications in improving the reading achievement of struggling readers in elementary schools. The review applies consistent inclusion standards to focus on studies that met high methodological standards. A total of 20 studies based on about 7,000 students in grades 1-6 were included in the final analysis. Findings indicate that educational technology applications produced a positive but small effect on the reading skills of struggling readers (ES = .14) in comparison with business as usual methods. Among four types of educational technology applications, small-group integrated applications such as Read, Write & Type and the Lindamood Phoneme Sequence Program produced the largest effect sizes (ES = .32). These are tutorial educational technology applications that use small-group interaction tightly integrated with reading curriculum. Supplementary models, such as Jostens and Lexia, had a larger number of studies (N=12) and a more modest effect size (ES = .18). Comprehensive models, such as READ 180 and ReadAbout (ES = .04) and Fast ForWord (ES = .06), did not produce meaningful positive effect sizes. However, the results of these two categories of programs should be interpreted with extreme caution due to the small number of studies involved. More studies are required to validate the effectiveness of all technology applications. Policy implications are discussed."

One major challenge is that educational systems vastly vary between cultures and countries. The differences start from the conceptualisation of education and school. It is, therefore, quite inaccurate to handle education as a universal concept. In this article the authors evade generalisation by discussing the use of mobile technology in the schools of one single, relatively homogenous nation: Finland. The backbone of their analysis is the core national curriculum of basic education. The appropriateness of mobile technology in the school context is reflected upon through the objectives and ethos of basic education. The conclusions are discussed in terms of their contribution to the understanding of the use culture of mobile technology."

        "The use of educational technology has been improving in schools since the turn of the century. The current educational curriculum has been revamped to incorporate information, communications and technology (ICT). The immersion has either been a stand-alone subject or infused into elements of other subjects, most prominently in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM). In some educational technology research, it has shown that infusion of technology has shown contrasting results when it came to teaching and learning. Although, there have also been studies that shown improvement in motivation of the students in this technology laced classrooms, yet it did not lead to a better cognitive understanding. Furthermore with the problems such as difficulty in accessing to technology, teacher misconception about technology usage in classroom, student disengagement towards learning in classroom, we could not see the full extent of the educational technology capability. And so this spawns for the introduction of games as an educational tool; as it is related with enjoyment and is far off from its relation to work. With the infusion of technology, it has produced off shoots such as game based learning, serious games and more recently gamification. As gamification refers to the inclusion of 'gamefulness' to existing systems as opposed to creating an entirely new game; thus paves the way for easier implementation as an educational tool. Therefore this paper will discuss about the role of gamification as an educational technology tool in engaging and motivating students; based on analyses review of several literatures."

        "The flipped classroom approach is becoming increasingly popular. This instructional approach allows more in-class time to be spent on interactive learning activities, as the direct lecturing component is shifted outside the classroom through instructional videos. However, despite growing interest in the flipped classroom approach, no robust frameworks have been developed for the design or school/faculty-wide implementation of flipped classrooms. The aim of this article is to provide a foundation for the flipped classroom approach in Spector's (Foundations of educational technology: integrative approaches and interdisciplinary perspectives, Routledge, New York, 2016) model of six pillars of educational technology. After reviewing previous discussion of the flipped classroom approach, each pillar (i.e., communication, interaction, environment, culture, instruction, and learning) is discussed in the context of flipped learning. Using Spector's (2016) framework and drawing on relevant theories and empirical findings, 10 recommendations are made. These recommendations are particularly useful for the school/faculty-wide implementation of flipped classrooms. As the foundational framework proposed in this article is only preliminary, further studies (e.g., design-based research) are recommended to increase the robustness of the design framework and ultimately improve educational practices."

Each year, considerable effort and money are invested into new technologies, hoping to find the next effective learning tool. However, technology changes rapidly and little attention is paid to the changes after they occur. This paper provides an overall picture of the changing trends in educational technology by analyzing the Horizon Reports' predictions of the most influential educational technologies from 2011 to 2021, identifying larger trends across these yearly predictions, and by using bibliometric analysis to evaluate the accuracy of the identified trends. The results suggest that mobile and analytics technologies trended consistently across the period, there was a trend towards maker technologies and games in the early part of the decade, and emerging technologies (e.g., VR, AI) are predicted to trend in the future. Overall, the specific technologies focused on by the HRs' predictions and by educational researchers' publications seem to coincide with the availability of consumer grade technologies, suggesting that the marketplace and technology industry is driving trends (cf., pedagogy or theory)."

Over time, even though with different approaches, methods and tools, educational technology as a field of research has followed substantially two main directions. The first direction has resulted in studies on the new technical and conceptual skills required by digital technologies, the second has focused on the use of ICT to change teaching and learning environments and the way in which curricular subjects are taught. In this paper the evolution of research in educational technology is briefly outlined considering these two orientations. The paper then considers how policy issues influence the large-scale implementation of plans for digital schools with a brief examination of the specific case of Italy."

        "School-driven technological innovation has the potential to positively impact on classroom practice, yet it can also be disrupted by incompatibilities between the existing school ecology and new educational technologies. To help mitigate this disruption a particular staf member often takes on a facilitative leadership role to champion new technology initiatives. However little is known about how this technology leader role impacts on the adoption of new technologies in the classroom. Taking a situated lens, we embarked on a multiple case study of four schools who were aiming to adopt a new literacy game in the classroom. Through interviews with technology leaders and fieldnotes from our site observations, we systematically analysed their actions and concerns over two academic terms. This highlighted an overwhelming concern with managing the material dimension of the technology, teacher agency and division of labour and mechanisms for communication and monitoring. Our findings raise important considerations for HCI researchers seeking to embed their technologies into practice alongside recommendations for supporting leaders tasked with coordinating this process."

A cross-sectional survey design was used to determine what educational technologies were being used and to identify an individual at each institution who could serve as an information resource for peer-to-peer questions. Results. Eighty-nine survey instruments were returned for a response rate of 75.4%. The resulting data illustrated the almost ubiquitous presence of educational technology. The most frequently used technology was course management systems and the least frequently used technology was microblogging. Conclusions. Educational technology use is trending toward fee-based products for enterprise-level applications and free, open-source products for collaboration and presentation. Educational technology is allowing educators to restructure classroom time for something other than simple transmission of factual information and to adopt an evidence-based approach to instructional innovation and reform."

It aims a school committed to procedures of informal learning that encourage ICT, network organization, openness to ubiquitous learning and transformation of methodologies. It also aims to explore the role in another school of digital book, improvement of life in classrooms, to break his limits and rethink some principles from those of mass education. Initial and continuing teacher training in ICT is related to teaching transformation processes. A set of principles is proposed to generate transformations, such as research on learning, experimentation with new devices and software, reflection on educational principles and the transformation of pedagogical approaches, a new role to knowledge and its construction in classrooms, changing the status of the evaluation, another way to approach the teaching profession, commitment to new partners, management teams and institutions and the ability to learn from the innovations themselves."

        "Educational technologies have become a standard part of the educational process and their appropriate integration into education provides countless opportunities for both teachers and students, from activation of students, their better motivation to learn, more illustrative explanation of the curriculum, to obtaining feedback, etc. For the creation of such an effective learning environment it is essential that teachers keep up with the digital age and respond to the changes brought by the constant progress in the field of technologies, and that they be interested and trained continuously in this area to develop their technology skills. However, from practice it is evident that there are still teachers who do not integrate technologies into teaching because they are not able to use them properly. The paper deals with the situation in foreign languages teaching in secondary education. In particular, the aim of the exploratory survey is to map the level of training of teachers of foreign languages during their university studies for the effective use of educational technologies and to find out the willingness of the teachers to participate in further training in this field in their workplace and to explore whether and how they find the news and trends on the integration of educational technologies. The target group are foreign language teachers of selected secondary vocational schools and grammar schools in the Czech Republic. An interview is used as the tool to carry out the exploratory survey."

        "The use of educational technology (ET) worldwide is increasing rapidly, and South Africa is no exception. Grouped amongst the emerging economies of the world, South Africa's information and communication technology (ICT) infrastructure is often mentioned as one of the key factors leading to the growth of the country. Integrating ICT into education has become a priority for the South African government. However, it is necessary to move beyond merely providing physical access to ICT's in order for integration to be successful. The integration of ET in schools is greatly influenced by teachers' attitudes towards the technology. The aim of this study was to investigate teachers' attitudes towards educational technology and the factors that are thought to influence teachers' attitudes, namely, perceived usefulness, perceived cultural relevance, perceived competence and access to ET. A convenience sample of 117 teachers in the Johannesburg area, from both public and private schools, across foundation, intermediate and senior phase, completed the Attitudes Towards Computer Scale. Teachers' attitudes were generally positive. The strongest predictor of teachers' attitudes was perceived usefulness followed by perceived cultural relevance. Thus, it is evident that when integrating ET into schools, attention must be paid to teachers perceptions of the utility of ET in order for integration to be successful. Having access to ET and the competence to use ET are not enough for the successful integration of ET in schools."

Obviously, modern devices and means of transmitting information are necessary for its development. Modem \"virtual lectures\", e-learning courses, online testing, educational resources portals, as well as digital school registers and educational process monitoring systems have become everyday reality. However, the digitalization of the educational system has both positive and negative side. The purpose of the article is to consider the impact of digital educational technologies on learning, from a university teacher's view point, and to consider their positive aspects and problems. The study was conducted at the I.M. Sechenov First Moscow State Medical University (Sechenov University) and University at the Inter-Parliamentary Assembly of EurAsEC. The study involved 89 teachers who have teaching experience at the university (11.9% - 1-7 years, 28.1% - 8-10 years; 30.8% - 11-15 years; 29.2% - 16-25 years). The main results show that, respondents overly have a good opinion towards learning in virtual environments. The advantages of e-learning are complex for a particular measurement, but it has been found that some identifying variables as \"age\" shows statistically significant differences, while \"gender\" and \"teaching experience\" are not important for evaluating the four provided variables. The study results can be used to improve the perception of new educational technologies by teachers, to organize approaches for introducing innovative educational technologies that expand the possibilities of progressive education on the part of administrations of higher educational institutions and educational departments."

The goal of TWG9 was to help inform policy and practice by providing insights into key factors that contribute to scalability and sustainability of educational technology integration and impact."

This study answered this question by examining how Chinese undergraduate EdTech students perceived their satisfaction with their programs and what factors affect their satisfaction. We conducted a survey investigation with more than 3000 undergraduate EdTech students from more than 100 Chinese universities that offered bachelor's degrees in EdTech. We performed descriptive and inferential analyses (Multiple Regression Modeling and Multilevel Linear Modeling). The results indicated that (1) the overall undergraduate EdTech students' satisfaction with their programs has much room for improvement; (2) students were generally less satisfied with the resources or facilities that their programs provided and with their employability; (3) students' career goals after the undergraduate study were highly centralized to teaching in K-12 schools or obtaining a higher degree; (4) their satisfaction was affected by multiple factors such as region, universality level (ranking), university funding status, students' academic grades, their willingness to enroll in EdTech programs, and their educational internship experience. Implications are discussed, and suggestions for the program satisfaction improvement are provided."

        "While the next generation of educational technologies (ET), such as monitor-based (MB) and virtual reality (VR) applications, are still in their infancy, they do show promise for improving education. In this study, we compared MB and VR educational technologies as alternative supplemental learning environments to traditional classroom instruction using lectures, textbooks, and physical labs. We conducted the study in four high school chemistry classes, as chemistry education is well suited for visually enhanced explanations for learning abstract concepts, and provides a solid testing situation for current and extended reality ET. Ultimately, this research project serves as a foundation to determine whether ETs have the potential to engage high school students in their STEM classes. Successful integration of ET into the public school system curricula may be a viable solution to engage students in STEM education."

Data were treated through thematic document analysis and categorical content analysis. The theoretical framework rested on pedagogical models for distance education, interaction in virtual environments, educational technologies and media, and continuous training. The study concluded that a pedagogical model predominates with a cognitive conception of learning, with a prevalence of self-instructional courses and the use of educational technologies with characteristics of: asynchronous communication, rich in communication symbols and mutual and reactive interactions. The model adopted stimulates the self-development of the staff, taking advantage of the potential of digital technology in inducing learning. It is suggested to investigate the impact of the adopted model on organizational culture."

In this presentation I would like to discuss some aspects of Chemical Technology teaching at university. It is a very specific problem. Why? University is not a technical school, there are not given any engineering courses except chemical technology. Usually students at university have not well enough technical background. Faculty of Chemistry University of Warsaw is a large research and teaching centre with fully developed programmes in fields of chemistry. Among many courses given at our faculty Chemical Technology belongs to courses difficulties making students. Chemical Technology Division experiences will be presented in context of the course contents, student teacher communication, types of supporting materials for lecture and laboratory. There will be presented examples of experiments manuals, schemes of installations for periodic and continuous chemical processes, unit operations and unit processes simulations using CHEMCAD (TM) version 6 program.

The ETC of 226 elementary school teachers from private and public schools is reported in this descriptive quantitative study. Five (5) competences emerged from factor analysis of the instrument used to determine the ETC. Four (4) of the competences were deemed 'competent,' while the other was deemed 'very competent. Furthermore, MANOVA revealed that only the greatest educational attainment and the type of school where they teach have an impact on their ETC. Sex, years of teaching, and age had no significant effect on their ETC. Hence, the research presented recommendations for what should be considered in teacher training, particularly in terms of improving teachers' ETC."

        "Evidence from large-scale studies of primary and secondary students' technology practices at school over the last decade show disparities in student practices and suggest that schools need to do more to cater for all students. Research that explores the influence of social and cultural factors may be useful for understanding such inequality in student practice. Bourdieu's theory of practice [(1977). Outline of a Theory of Practice. London: Cambridge University Press] is proposed as an example of a sociological theory that can be adopted in educational technology research to move towards understanding the wider complexities of technology practice. To encourage discourse and application of Bourdieu's sociology in the field of educational technology research, this paper provides an introduction to the theory, a review of its application in research of primary and secondary students' technology practice and relevant conceptual work. The paper presents a conceptual framework based on Bourdieu's theory that has been developed through two recent studies, and review of empirical and conceptual works and invites its application in future research so that it can be critiqued and further developed."

        "Despite rapid progress, most of the educational technologies today lack a strong instructional design knowledge basis leading to questionable quality of instruction. In addition, a major challenge is to customize these educational technologies for a wide range of customizable instructional designs. Ontologies are one of the pertinent mechanisms to represent instructional design in the literature. However, existing approaches do not support modeling of flexible instructional designs. To address this problem, in this paper, we propose an ontology based framework for systematic modeling of different aspects of instructional design knowledge based on domain patterns. As part of the framework, we present ontologies for modeling goals, instructional processes and instructional material. We demonstrate the ontology framework by presenting instances of the ontology for the large scale case study of adult literacy in India (287 million learners spread across 22 Indian Languages), which requires creation of hundreds of similar but varied eLearning Systems based on flexible instructional designs. The implemented framework is available at http://rice.iiit.ac.in and is transferred to National Literacy Mission Authority of Government of India. The proposed framework could be potentially used for modeling instructional design knowledge for school education, vocational skills and beyond."

The dataset consists of pre- and posttest scores for each experiment, as well as background information on the students, such as gender, age, ability, grade repetition and neighborhood characteristics. It also includes motivation of students. The dataset, or parts of it, could be interesting to use in future studies, focusing on effects of the use of educational technology, for comparison with similar and/or slightly different experiments, and for studies such as meta-analyses or replication studies, especially given the individual experimental setup."

        "The scientific community regards the health-sustaining environment as a cornerstone of modern and future school education. Health is the basic criterion, a sort of \"social barometer\", demonstrating the value of a human's life for the society. Health-sustaining educational technologies, aimed at formation of positive attitude to the education, help to facilitate the learning process. The proposed article examines organisational, methodological and technological foundations underlying the formation of the health-sustaining environment of an educational institution. The key elements are the following: provision of educational process participants with health-sustaining value orientations; health-sustaining activity and health-sustaining educational technologies aimed at study facilitation and academic overloads removal, which will help to preserve schoolchildren's health, their physical, mental, moral and social well-being. In a modern educational institution, children's health should be preserved and improved by a special service; the experimental work of one of this is represented by the researchers. In the conclusion, the authors propose an operational definition of health-sustaining environment and a possible variant of its formation.

        "A TechnoEthical Framework for Teachers (TEFT) is introduced to aid educators in selecting and employing educational technologies in ethically sound and pedagogical sensitive ways in their classrooms. TEFT views technology through three key technoethical lenses or perspectives: instrumental, sociomaterial and existential. The instrumental lens is most familiar to teachers and focuses on the policies and laws governing teachers' and students' uses of technology. The sociomaterial perspective attends to technology's built-in biases and how it translates behaviour in prescribed or circumscribed ways. The existential lens considers how students' and teachers' entanglements with technology condition how they experience the world and transform their ways of knowing, doing, being and becoming. Taken together, these three approaches provide teachers with a theoretically robust view of the ethical implications of using technology in the classroom."

To approach programs as a policy, Ball and Bowe (1998) are used as a reference when discussing the policy cycle. Its discussed Interdisciplinarity as a pedagogical and dialogical relationship as from Fazenda (2008) in collaboration with Souza and Fazenda (2017) that relate technologies, curriculum, and interdisciplinarity. The discussion on digital inclusion as a process of appropriating digital technologies in an active, participatory, and purposeful way is contemplated by Pereira (2006) and Bonilla (2005). This research was conducted based on a documentary analysis in official documents of government programs. In addition, an electronic form was prepared and sent to two teachers from two public schools involved in these proposals. The results show that the programs under study contributed to interdisciplinary practices, so the immersion of digital technologies from an interdisciplinary perspective is done following the school's curriculum proposal, since policies are re-signified by social subjects who translate political texts in different arenas. The results show that the program proposals are conducive to the development of interdisciplinary practices, however, the gaps felt by teachers in the context of practice, echo as an unfavorable factor for the immersion of digital technologies from an interdisciplinary perspective."

        "The purpose of this study was to determine the perceptions of physical educators regarding their accessibility to educational technology, the availability of technical help, and specific obstacles to incorporating technology in their classrooms. Respondents were 201 adapted and general physical education instructors who taught at middle and high schools in two large school districts in the Southwestern United States. Respondents completed three sections of a previously validated survey utilized in a nationwide 2011 educational technology study involving literacy teachers. Results indicated the top available technologies for instruction were laptop computers, digital projectors, computer labs with Internet connections, iPods, and pedometers. High percentages of respondents indicated they had a sufficient level of available technological support from library/media specialists, school administrators (for obtaining resources), in-school and district technology coordinators, and other teachers in their building. The top perceived barriers to implementing educational technology were lack of understanding of how to integrate technology, lack of incentives to use technology, lack of time because of high-stakes testing, difficulty of managing a classroom when students are using computers, and lack of technical support. A comparison of these results with previous research demonstrates a rapid recent increase in school use of educational technology and underscores the need to help physical education teachers better incorporate new technology in their classrooms. Results also provide a baseline from which future studies may track the progress of technology use in physical education classrooms."

This chapter offers valuable theoretical grounding to help guide researchers and leaders in the field of Educational Technology. Data indicate that basic technology skills alone cannot lead to higher levels of technology use in the classroom. Suggestions are provided on best ways to integrate educational technology into pre-service teacher education programs and in-service teacher professional development programs to enhance effectively teaching and learning in K-12 classrooms."

Students' reviewing behaviors were logged and the associated learning impacts were analyzed by monitoring their progress throughout the course. The study confirmed that students who had an improvement in their performance spent more time and effort reviewing formal assessments, particularly their mistakes. These students also demonstrated consistency in their reviewing behavior throughout the semester. In contrast, students who fell behind in class ineffectively reviewed their graded assessments by focusing mostly on what they already knew instead of their knowledge misconceptions."

Specific elements like, outcomes, assessment, content, learning environment and resources which serve as useful points of reflection when internationalising sections of this special educational technology module are also examined. Although the focus of internationalising any curriculum is about teaching all students how to facilitate development of their skills, knowledge and attributes including the teaching of different multi-cultural student groups, the article also explores the problems associated with teaching multi-student cohort groups and similar groups who may have special educational needs. Various strategies which could be used in this area for overcoming some of these difficulties are outlined. An exploration of the challenges and benefits of developing multicultural groups as a pedagogical strategy including reference to examples of best practice is addressed. The article concludes by highlighting the problems associated with teaching, designing and delivering international group work activities."

The analysis explores the concentration of discourses that make possible certain framings of technology in educational contexts that seek to act upon the notions of citizenship and identity among Muslims in Malaysia. Using the lenses of neofundamentalism and neoliberalism and leveraging analysis methods from the grounded theory methodological tradition, this study examined the ways the Malaysian government works on constructing the identities of its young Muslim citizenry by way of policy initiatives for the implementation of educational technologies. Sixteen documents produced and published by the Malaysian government served as the data for the analysis. Findings indicate that a neofundamentalist governmental rhetoric insists on looking to the past nostalgically and to non-rational textual hermeneutics for interpretations of Islam. At the same time, neoliberalism underpins discourses on educational technology and 'wealth-making' contemporary discourses on education and particularly educational technology. This produces a situation in which contemporary Malaysian government citizen work is locked in a crisis of bilateral nostalgia whereby a technology-rich and materially wealthy future is anticipated simultaneously with a longing for an Islamic civilization rooted in past traditionalisms and spiritualities. The Malaysian government then works a form of alchemy to manage this ironic tension."

The pedagogical preparation determines better learning outcomes, effective social and cultural expressions, and more qualitative guidance of the didactic process. In addition, teachers with the help of technology have the opportunity to draw attention to each student, help the learner to know himself and his or her field of professional expression. This case study examined the ability of vocational teachers to use various technologies in class. Study was conducted in five rural vocational training schools in Lithuania. Twenty five vocational teachers were interviewed using focus group interview format about their smart educational technology usage in teaching and contacting their students. Teachers were observed manipulating, transforming and allocating appropriate digital media, adapting teaching content and easily forming teaching-learning networks to achieve educational goals. Overall, the process described here showed that regardless of how long vocational teachers work at a rural school and what subjects they teach, mostly teachers communicated and collaborated through technologies with their students while presenting vocational teaching content. Finally, the technological competence of vocational teachers reflected the teacher's ability to carry out a certain vocational teaching process: the ability to perform technological operations, the skill to work with various materials, equipment and the mentoring capacity."

        "Over the course of its long development, the modern educational technology curriculum has undergone several changes and amassed a lot of information. Theoretically speaking, the state places a strong priority on the use of IT in schools. Students majoring in education should take educational technology courses so that they can learn the characteristics and application techniques of core current information-based teaching media and incorporate them into their own lesson plans and classroom activities. This will help them meet the information needs of today's classrooms as they evolve with the advent of educational modernization and availability of educational information. Thus, this research employs a wireless sensor network (WSN) to gather and send data on ed tech classes and then employs AI to assess those classes' quality and guide real-time changes to how they are taught and complete the following tasks: (1) The development status of educational technology courses and WSN at home and abroad is introduced. (2) The application of WSN in teaching is introduced, the basic principle of GRU neural network and related optimization algorithms is expounded, and the quality evaluation system of educational technology courses is constructed. (3) The IPSO-Adam-GRU evaluation model improves the GRU neural network's hyperparameters with the help of the improved PSO approach and Adam gradient descent. The model is fed test data for evaluation, and the findings are compared to those from an expert's evaluation to determine how well the model performs. The results demonstrate that the model established for this article is superior to others since it provides a more accurate assessment."

        "New time challenges cause new contradictions that are peculiar for educational environment in Russia and they require instant solutions. We have identified the contradictions which defined our target to determine the techniques and methods of distance education for students of pedagogical specializations based on practice-oriented approach, implementation of media educational technologies into the preparation of university students aimed at the development of knowledge, competencies and skills in distance learning in different types of educational institutions. Media educational technologies are conditioned by general pedagogical and didactic principles and the choice of pedagogical methods directly depends on the content of educational discipline, conditions of its implementation and other factors. Media educational technologies used for the completion of social-pedagogical disciplines for university students consist of creative and game tasks. Using them it is essential to consider special features of various media and the target of the lesson. Practice is another relevant purpose in the process of distance learning. We believe that this problem will be dominating in the nearest future as practice in distance learning is focused on by higher education institutions. In this article some techniques and types of this practical training are presented being shaped by the format of distance learning. During various practices the students of pedagogical specializations will be able not only to prepare for their future work but also to assist subject teachers, social pedagogues in schools and to make considerable contributions in this work."

More than 3,600 Grade 7 students across nine in-person and one virtual schools within the same district were randomly assigned to one of the four conditions. Students received nine 30-minute intervention sessions from September 2020 to March 2021. Hierarchical linear modeling analyses of the final analytic sample (N = 1,850) showed significantly higher posttest scores for students who used From Here to There and DragonBox 12+ compared to the Active Control condition. No significant difference was found for the Immediate Feedback condition. The findings have implications for understanding how game-based applications can affect algebraic understanding, even within pandemic pressures on learning."

Prior work has probed how children generally interact with and learn from these technologies, however, there is limited research on student engagement with applications that utilize valuable input techniques such as automatic handwriting and speech recognition. In our study, we designed and field-tested early literacy speech and handwriting recognition applications with the primary aim of maximizing student engagement. We designed the applications based on prior research insights and classroom observations from our target population and field-tested the applications with 283 children living in rural Tanzania. We found that observing a small set of classrooms can produce design insights that increase engagement on tablet-based learning systems on a much larger scale. We also demonstrate the importance of domain familiarity in students' choice to persist through activities while learning with technology."

        "Educational Technology (ETEC) professionals in the United States (US) fill multiple roles in public school systems. While these roles can be classified into broad categories, what remains unclear are the expectations and priorities for the completion of these roles and the tasks associated within each role category. In order for ETEC professionals to be successful, they need clear guidance on what their performance expectations and prioritized roles should be. This research seeks to add clarity regarding expectations by surveying K-12 building administrators to identify perceptions of ETEC professionals within their schools regarding their actual and ideal performances relative to eight role categories. Results indicate that these US building administrators place high importance on the Technological and Administrative Communication categories. The data also show that there is a significant gap between the ideal and actual performance expectations of ETEC professionals in all eight role categories, but most demonstrably within the Instructional Support and Teaching/Training categories. Results also signal the desire for ETEC professionals to focus more on training and collaboration with teachers regarding technology integration within classrooms. This suggests that administrators want ETEC professionals to complete more instructional tasks than they currently perform. Findings from this study hold implications for the training of ETEC professionals and can potentially inform the curriculum of educational technology preparation programs in the US and beyond."

This study aimed to integrate the virtual dissection table (VDT) into the gastrointestinal anatomy course and assess medical students' intended learning outcomes and satisfaction with this educational technology.MethodsThis quasi-experimental study enrolled second-year undergraduate medical students who studied anatomical sciences in the autumn semester of 2021-2022 at a single medical school. In the intervention and control groups, the participants were randomized to study anatomy by VDT or topographical anatomy textbooks. The knowledge tests evaluated the students' learning outcomes of gastrointestinal anatomy, and following the course, students completed a satisfaction survey.ResultsThe findings indicated that a significant gain occurred, and instructional intervention during which the learning environment was enriched with virtual dissection could enhance the students' learning (F = 13.33, df = 2, P < 0.01, partial eta(2) = 0.20) and satisfaction (T = 6.10, df = 54, P < 0.01, Cohen's d = 1.63, CI95% = 1.02-2.23).ConclusionsThis study demonstrates the potential for virtual dissection to augment anatomical science education. Further research is required to consider the contributing features and apply this educational technology to enhance students' anatomy learning."

The field of CEIT could be said to cover the fields of educational technology and distance education. A total of 156 master's theses and dissertations were examined in order to identify the keywords, academic discipline, research areas, theoretical frameworks, research designs and models, variables and related institutions. According to the research findings, it was seen that quantitative methods were mostly used in the theses and dissertations examined and that mixed methods were used in master's theses more than in doctoral dissertations. In addition, it was revealed that few of the theses and dissertations had theoretical foundations. K-12 students were mostly preferred as the type of participant, and scales and interviews were most popular as data collection tools. Moreover, the variables of academic performance and effectiveness were mostly used as dependent variables. The present study, which conducted systematic content analysis of master's and doctoral dissertations in the field of CEIT, is thought to be important in terms of revealing the current situation in the fields of Educational Technology and Distance Education and determining the research trends."

Method: methodological study with descriptive nature. The validation process was attended by 33 specialists in educational technologies and/or in excess of infantile weight. The agreement index of 80% was the minimum considered to guarantee the validation of the material. Results: most of the specialists had a doctoral degree and a graduate degree in nursing. Regarding content, illustrations, layout and relevance, all items were validated and 69.7% of the experts considered the album as great. The overall agreement validation index for the educational technology was 0.88. Only the scriptsheet 3 did not reach the cutoff point of the content validation index. Changes were made to the material, such as title change, inclusion of the school context and insertion of nutritionist and physical educator in the story narrated in the album. Conclusion: the proposed serial album was considered valid by experts regarding content and appearance, suggesting that this technology has the potential to contribute in health education by promoting healthy weight in the age group of 7 to 10 years."

        "The ultimate goals in education are the need for enhanced teaching-learning experiences from students and teachers and access to quality education. Technology is an option through which these goals can be reached. We define Educational technology as the effective use of technological tools in learning. The concept encompasses an array of tools, such as media, machines and networking hardware, as well as considering underlying theoretical perspectives for their effective application [1]. The application of theories of human behavior theories to educational technology derives input from learning theory, educational psychology, and human performance technology. Of all the different approaches that exist within educational technology we will focus on Blended Learning. Blended Learning emerges like the overlap of online and face to face education. From this perspective, Blended Learning is a solution to integrate the different kinds of technological advances with the interaction offered in traditional learning. To meet the needs of this formal education program, several companies have gotten involved on the development of learning technology which has generated an expansion of scientific groups focusing on E-Learning systems. However, research shows that up to 60% of any kind of implementations have failed despite improvements in technology, content development, increased knowledge and awareness [2]. On the other hand, there are changes in the way that students learn, in the style in which teachers deliver their lessons and also in the physical environments where the teaching-learning process is held. Even the role physical environments play in our learning is just beginning to be studied and understood. All these changes are motivated by the development of Learning technologies and also by the ever-changing pedagogical methods. The technological evolution on Educational Technology emanates from users' (teachers and students) needs but also from the surrounding socio-cultural and demographic changes, climate variability, regulations, and aesthetic tendencies. In this context, \"technological adaptability is crucial to support the building sustainability by ensuring users' well being and safety (comfort, quality of life, positive interaction....), long-term building value (longevity, cost effectiveness, strong image, etc.) and functional efficiency (multi-functionality, efficient physical and virtual connections, etc.)\" [3]. Based on the premise that adaptability is essential in all educational technology development; in the present paper we study the effects of implementing a Blended Learning application called PowerChalk [4] in a school environment with different kinds of needs. PowerChalk is a software based on modular programming that allows to quickly ameliorate any problem within the system and evolve to new features to improve any learning process [5,6]. The modular structure also enables a Distributed Software Development with unexpected benefits from a pedagogical point of view. In the present paper we show case the development process and as a preliminary outcome, the pedagogical and technological benefits of Technological Adaptability in Educational Technology."

        "In this chapter, we carry out a critical review of the various historical analyses of the impact of technological interventions in education. The purpose is to analytically explore and learn from some of the methodological limitations and strengths of the approaches adopted to measure and capture the impact of educational technology. This retrospective examination is then used to explicate methodological design principles that can increase the use and value of research evidence regarding the impact of educational technology. Capturing and understanding the impact of digital technologies in and on learning is inherently problematic. It is exacerbated by the continually developing nature of digital technologies and their formal and informal boundary crossing. We posit methodological design principles that are sympathetic to the fact that evidence of the pedagogical application of digital technologies is both borne out of, and brought to bear in, complex and dynamic contexts that are mediated by, and impact upon, the various ways in which technologies are appropriated for educational purpose. The chapter concludes with a call for methodological perspectives that are not confined by paradigm, but are able to bridge and integrate research paradigms in order to respond to the complex sociocultural ecologies within which digital technologies are implicated."

        "Over the years, the educational technology has formed the subject of discussion among the various theoretical schools of education scholars. Its origin is related to the use of (later audiovisual / teaching aids) visual media in education and experimental analysis of human behavior (behaviorism). Until the 50s, the use of audiovisual resources was seen as a mere support the work of the teacher, who happens to arouse interest on the part of experts in audiovisual instruction, theories and models of communication as well as the role that these theories could play in the design and use of instructional media. From then on the Theory of Communication becomes the basis for the improvement of the transmission of instructional message, with goals geared to their results. In this context, Audiovisual and defined as the branch of educational theory and practice concerned primarily with the design and use of messages which control the learning process. Gradually he developed the Educational Technology, which is the field involved in the facilitation of human learning through the identification, development, organization and systematic use of a wide range of learning resources and through the management of these processes. From the seventies of the twentieth century, Educational Technology came to be defined as a complex, integrated process involving people, procedures, ideas, tools and organizations to analyze problems and plan, implement, evaluate and manage solutions to those problems involved in all aspects of human learning. The Educational Technology should adapt to the needs of a particular political-pedagogical project, placing the goals of determining the service and never since, if the technology does not receive the necessary educational treatment, the scope of the project tends to be ephemeral not changing the daily lives of teachers and students not making contributions to the teaching-learning process. Currently, we seek a new design which meets today's world educational needs and face the present challenges in education. To achieve these goals is essential the presence of technological advances, but the use of these innovations must be attuned to the needs and cultural, social and economic characteristics of the intended public, since much of the resistance to the use of technology is motivated by lack of such adjustment to the target audience."

This article describes the challenges that 21st century educational technologists are, and will be, addressing as they undertake the effective integration of new technologies into K-12 educational systems and learning environments. The expanding Internet, ever more powerful mobile devices, and other innovations make the task of designing effective formal and informal learning challenging, especially in light of the high rate of change in these new technologies. While these technologies introduce many benefits, they are also causing serious threats to system security and personal privacy. Furthermore, as these technologies continue to evolve, ethical issues such as equal access to resources become imperative. Educational technologists must expand their forward-thinking leadership and planning competencies so as to ensure effective use of new technologies."

        "Background/Objective: Academic self-concept is an important construct within the disciplines of medicine, psychology, and education. Enhancing the academic self-concept of students with special educational needs is very crucial because it is associated with their quality of life. This study aimed to examine the effect of a video-guided educational technology intervention on the academic self-concept of adolescents with hearing impairment who were attending inclusive nonresidential public schools in Southeast Nigeria. Methods: This study adopted a randomized controlled trial design. The participants were 60 junior secondary students with hearing impairment. We implemented a video-guided educational technology intervention. It relied on the use of 13-minute video clips with captions/subtitles, which covered academic self-concept-related themes. The Academic Self-Concept Questionnaire, which has been developed by Liu and Wang, was used to collect baseline, posttreatment, and follow-up data. We conducted independent-samples and pairedttest and computed Cohendand Glass Delta to analyze the data. Results: The video-guided educational technology intervention significantly improved the academic self-concept of the treatment group participants, when compared with the care-as-usual control group participants,t(58) = 9.07,P < .001. These improvements in academic self-concept were sustained at follow up among the treatment group participants, when compared with the care-as-usual control group participants,t(48.56) = 10.898,P Conclusion: The video-guided educational technology intervention was effective in improving the academic self-concept of adolescents with hearing impairment who were attending inclusive nonresidential public schools. Large-scale studies are needed to maximize the impact of video-guided educational technology interventions on students with hearing impairments who attend inclusive non residential public schools in Nigeria."

        "This article presents Bourdieu's theory of practice as a tool for exploring school students' technology practice in empirical research. The authors provide educational technology researchers with an accessible introduction to the theory of practice. They then detail the conceptual, methodological and analytic application of the theory of practice in two educational technology studies. The application of the theory in the two studies highlights the potential of the sociological framing for informing a robust critical research agenda and understanding the circumstances that can contribute to digital inequalities. Practically, knowledge gained through theoretically informed research is critical for researchers, governments, schools and teachers in working to overcome digital inequalities."

        "Educational technology is a discipline that has a lot of roles to play in the global education system yet, its services had been neglected over the years in Nigeria. The new global reality that was occasioned by the upsurge of COVID-19 has made educational technology a very consequential discipline with conspicuous roles to play in the face of such a global pandemic. COVID-19 has halted many human activities across the globe. Its effect in the education system has resulted to re-adjustment in the school calendar, prolonged graduation dates, and reduced research output. To combat this, many education systems now adopt the services of educational technology thereby changing the old norm. But for this new norm to be sustainable, this paper argues that the education system must show a pragmatic attitude towards the adoption of such innovation rather than a conservative attitude. Therefore, using the diffusion theory of innovation, this paper argues that necessity called for compulsory adoption of innovation in the Nigerian education system. This new opportunity, however, looks bleak as many educational practitioners lack the required skills and attitude to adopt the innovation. It, therefore, concludes that educational practitioners need in-service training to be part of these changes. The government is suggested to apply a systematic approach in procuring and installing ICT facilities that will enhance the diffusion of this innovation into the school system."

        "In 2005, a new profession called \"educational technologist\" was introduced in Estonian schools. At first, the idea was confusing for many school principals, because of the seeming overlap with the job descriptions of existing ICT support specialists or ICT managers. Other principals interpreted the role of the educational technologist as a technology-savvy teacher who could take responsibility for teaching with technology in some subject domains so that the rest of teachers would not have to bother them with constantly changing landscape of technology. According to the data from the Tiger Leap Foundation (2012), almost 7% of Estonian schools had hired an educational technologist by 2012 - in most of the cases by re-allocating the salary fund of IT support specialists. The position is usually funded by local municipalities, not from the state budget. This paper is reflecting upon the case study data collected from 13 Estonian schools where educational technologists had been employed, the focus group interviews were conducted with 29 persons working in the field of educational technology. The study gives an overview of the current situation by defining the emerging profession of educational technologist on the level of professional practice. We also describe the arguments for establishing such a new position in school and the main challenges of a new specialist starting his/her career in this dynamic field."

Hence based on the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), the current study aims to investigate the impact of various external factors, i.e., appreciation learning climate, facilitation learning climate, learning through reflection, and learning through experimentation on the adoption of technology among junior school teachers in Indonesia. Using a quantitative field survey, data were collected from 410 respondents and were analyzed using SmartPls3 by testing through the measurement and structural model. Results revealed that junior school teachers have a positive attitude towards the use of educational technology. Also, the external factors, i.e., appreciation learning climate was positively associated with perceived usefulness. Whereas facilitation learning climate, learning through reflection, and learning through experimentation were found to be positively and significantly associated with the perceived ease of use and actual use of the educational technology. Integrating Motivation-Hygiene Theory with the TAM model, this study revealed how multiple external factors motivate teachers to incorporate educational technology in their teaching methodologies. Besides extending the literature related to TAM and motivation theory, several future research directions are suggested."

Building on this work, this paper examines how technocentrism as a specific strain of neoliberalism is reflected at both the organizational and institutional levels, both by private and public sectors in the case of school education in India. We argue that using institutional theory to explain complex multi-layered reforms means looking in tandem at macro principles defined through interactions in the organizational field and the re-experiencing and transformation of those processes at the micro level."

        "Advanced by powerful venture philanthropies, educational technology companies, and the US Department of Education, a growing movement to apply 'big data' through 'learning analytics' to create 'personalized learning' is currently underway in K-12 education in the United States. While scholars have offered various critiques of the corporate school reform agenda, the role of personalized learning technology in the corporatization of public education has not been extensively examined. Through a content analysis of US Department of Education reports, personalized learning advocacy white papers, and published research monographs, this paper details how big data and adaptive learning systems are functioning to redefine educational policy, teaching, and learning in ways that transfer educational decisions from public school classrooms and teachers to private corporate spaces and authorities. The analysis shows that all three types of documents position education within a reductive set of economic rationalities that emphasize human capital development, the expansion of data-driven instruction and decision-making, and a narrow conception of learning as the acquisition of discrete skills and behavior modification detached from broader social contexts and culturally relevant forms of knowledge and inquiry. The paper concludes by drawing out the contradictions inherent to personalized learning technology and corporatization of schooling. It argues that these contradictions necessitate a broad rethinking of the value and purpose of new educational technology."

Therefore, this review intended to examine the impact of educational technology and its alternative types on reading achievement for Chinese English second language learners (ESLs) to understand how to best use technology applications to facilitate reading instruction. A total of 35 qualified studies were included in our analysis covering a sample size of 7,989 Chinese K-12 participants. Consistent with previous meta-analyses, our findings indicated a modest positive impact of educational technology on reading outcomes compared with the traditional teaching method (d = +0.37). For the five types of intervention identified in this review, we found that the comprehensive model had the largest impact (d = +0.60), followed by social media tools (d = +0.46), integrated online-learning system (d = +0.31), and multimedia-transmission model (d = +0.27). However, supplementary activities did not generate educationally meaningful effects on reading outcomes for Chinese ESLs (d = +0.05). The impacts of different moderators, implications, and limitations were also discussed. We argue for further integrating technology with the existing curriculum and pedagogy. The study adds to the second language (L2) reading literature corpus."

        "The current experimental study examined whether different degrees of immersive and interactive experience made a difference in users' perceptions and intention to adopt a novel VR-based MR training system. In this paper, virtual reality was used as an educational technology that allowed users to virtually rotate 3-D objects and helped to enhance their spatial ability, which would be particularly useful in future careers in STEM. A 2 (display) x 2 (controller) x 2 (gender) experimental design was conducted. Researchers used a 2-D monoscopic display and a stereoscopic display to manipulate two different conditions of immersion, while a computer mouse and a hand-held controller were applied to measure the effects from two different levels of interactivity. Gender was examined due to prior research suggesting that males were better at MR tasks than females. The dependent variables were various perceptions and behavioral intentions developed from relevant theories in technology acceptance. The results showed that users' positive perceptions and intention to use the novel MR system were amplified whenever better immersive and interactive experiences were provided simultaneously, or when the inferior immersive and interactive experiences were offered at the same time. Females under a better immersive environment perceived better feelings of enjoyment, confirmation, satisfaction, and behavioral intention, compared with their male counterparts. Theoretical contributions in perceptions and use intention of educational technology, with a specific focus on VR, were discussed. Practical implications for developers of educational technology and K-12/college educators were provided."

The article considers possible ways of using digital storytelling as an educational technology for activating cognitive activity of primary school pupils in a foreign language lesson. The progressive ideas in this field are determined. The authors analyze the concept of the digital story and propose possible ways of using it by foreign language teachers on the basis of the use of progressive ideas that are in line with innovative educational tendencies. The main purpose of using digital storytelling as an educational technology for activating the cognitive activity of primary school pupils in a foreign language lesson is the development of pupils' thinking, raising their level of cognitive ability, and developing their emotional culture. Stories that can be the basis for creating a digital story can come from all over the world and include traditional stories and modern tales, animal stories, stories about everyday life, stories from other cultures and fantastic stories, etc. A teacher can choose a story that is most suitable for the linguistic and cognitive level of children. In addition, in the process of creating a digital story, the teacher can independently pick up the learning material to achieve the maximum educational effect. Children can analyze and work with the content of a digital storybook for better understanding their foreign language skills, for example, to analyze plot and characters, pointing out basic details, comparing events, putting forward assumptions, interpreting drawings, etc. This will promote to the development of speaking, reading, listening skills, expand children's vocabulary and optimize the process of learning a foreign language in general."

Hence, a convenience sample of 119 educators from schools in Johannesburg, South Africa, completed a questionnaire consisting of a demographics section, the Attitudes towards computer Scale (AtcS), and the Information and communication technology Survey (IctS). The results were analysed using descriptive statistics and multiple regressions. From the results it was evident that educators had differential access to Et at school and at home. Generally, the educators reported positive attitudes to Et particularly as it pertained to the usefulness of Et in the classroom. Furthermore, the results indicated that educators' access and attitudes significantly predicted their use and integration of Et in classrooms. Differential patterns of use and integration were found across teaching and learning, lesson planning, communication with parents and learners and personal communication. The findings suggest that interventions to improve the uptake of ET should consider access and attitudes as core constructs which influence Et use and integration."

        "This paper presents some of the first evidence on the effect of information and communications technology (ICT) on college students' labor market performance. Using a large, representative survey of college students in China, we examine outcomes before and after students were exposed to technology-aided instruction, compared with students who were not exposed to such instruction. The results indicate that the ICT program significantly increased students' likelihood of obtaining a job offer in the labor market and the wage they were offered. The positive effect comes from students' increased use of computers and the internet for job search. While most previous studies of the use of technology in education focus only on students' academic achievement and find zero or negative effects, our study demonstrates that technology may be an effective tool for improving college students' labor market performance, and that the potential benefits of technology might be underestimated if we focus only on test scores and ignore students' career development."

In this editorial, I analyze titles and abstracts of 7708 research articles from prominent journals over the past 5 years to identify common topics-such as \"online,\" \"mobile,\" and \"learning analytics.\" I also extract links from 51,496 K-12 school and 1317 university websites in the U.S. to identify common tools that they are linking to-such as Facebook, Twitter, Google Docs, and YouTube. I propose that these sorts of metrics provide a baseline understanding for other researchers and practitioners to draw upon when situating their work and that they can also give us insights into areas that merit greater attention for addressing real-world problems."

        "This article explores how eight secondary school teachers integrated educational technology into English language teaching in Beijing, China and considers their views of the factors influencing technology use. Analysing data from classroom recordings and follow-up interviews, this study revealed that PowerPoint was the most frequently used technological application in the classroom, while the internet and other technological tools were also used by the teachers. They employed educational technology for different pedagogical purposes, including addressing professional needs in improving teaching, designing materials and conducting professional development. Teachers also claimed that they used technology to address learners' needs, such as improving engagement, enhancing language acquisition, facilitating understanding and establishing a context for language use. The study identified four important factors in influencing teachers' use of technology, including sociocultural contexts, teachers' beliefs, access to resources, and technology competence and confidence. This study suggests that a critical reflective approach is useful in assisting teachers to understand their needs and pedagogical beliefs concerning technology use. Ongoing professional development is also valuable in promoting teachers' technology competence and confidence, thereby improving the use of technology in their teaching. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

        "Today the major purpose of the system of professional education in Russia is to train highly qualified professionals, able to work efficiently in their fields up to the latest world standards, capable of permanent professional development, social and professional mobility. That's why training teachers at Re-training and Qualification Improvement Centres is of most importance. Speaking about the latest tendencies in the work of the establishments of Additional Professional Education it should be noted that the training process is characterised by the following qualities: actualization of school practice; realization of reflexive processes; carrying out self-evaluation of the personal achievements and variability of the individualized education programmes. Therefore there is the need for the development of education programs which allow to change and reorganize the curriculum content taking into consideration the background level of teachers, their professional interests and the possibility of quality control. The programme aimed at training English Language teachers to use modern educational technologies was elaborated and implemented in compliance with these requirements. It is orientated at the most perspective tendencies of developing education programmes today (competency-based approach and modular structuring), based on androgogical principles. It includes the purposes, stages and considered as a complex system with its own structure including the target, contents, used technologies, methods for motivation and stimulation, the means of control and regulation, assessment and results units. The programme is of multifunctional character carrying out educational, diagnostic, managerial, motivational, coordinative and corrective functions. Besides, we have defined managerial and pedagogical conditions for raising the level of teachers' proficiency in the use of innovative educational technologies such as integration of theoretical, methodical, special and psycho-pedagogical training, extensive use of reflexive mechanisms and the purposeful use of active methods of education in accordance with the problem solving and active approaches. Our experience in implementation of the developed programme at the Retraining and Qualification Improvement Centres of Altai territory and Republic Altai shows that the effectiveness of training in the use of innovative educational technologies rises when applying the programme which includes the special course on \"The improvement of professional competences of English language teachers under new educational experience\". The research has also proved that the proposed methods, principles, forms and facilities can be widely used with the purpose of improvement of effectiveness of work at the establishments of Additional Professional Education."

In this new landscape, this study investigates student usage of such technologies as instant messaging, cell phones, e-readers, social networking, RSS feeds, podcasts, and tablets. In addition, this study aims to determine which technologies students prefer the library to utilize for a variety of services, such as reference assistance or book renewals, and which technologies may not be worth the investment, such as geosocial networking. The information gained from this survey is intended to provide guidance for libraries looking to provide services utilizing the most popular technologies with the most efficient use of resources. Survey results show an increasing use and dependence on educational technologies and a desire for basic library services to be available on a variety of platforms and technologies.

        "This study analyzes the integration of an educational technology platform and relates the difficulties faced amidst the Covid-19 pandemic. Initially, we sought to identify the chief barriers educators face when considering the adoption of Information and Communication Technology (ICT). Factors influencing primary and secondary education teachers' (n = 15) and students' (n = 335) perspectives on ICT integration for mathematics instruction were identified and analyzed from the perspective of different contexts (school vs home) and circumstances (in-person vs remote learning). Although we acknowledge the need for immediate decisions by educational stakeholders to facilitate online learning, our findings indicate the necessity of (a) careful examination of the features of potential platforms or tools and (b) a trial of such features prior to integration within an educational system. From an instructional design perspective, educational technologists should pay special attention to the degree of gamification, especially beyond the primary school level, as it may negatively impact incentives for student interaction and engagement. Where possible, the integration of technology should be driven by pedagogical goals and not technological pressures."

While some academics working in the area of educational technology have raised concerns, many others have so far failed to respond to what is a significant shift in the ongoing development of digital education. The paper considers how academic researchers and other educational technology stakeholders can respond to what might be perceived as the curtailment of some forms of digital education. In particular, the paper argues that this current turn away from digital devices offers an opportunity to advance understandings about a number of seemingly problematic issues regarding the continued use of digital technologies in schools. In particular, the paper reconsiders five such areas of concern that are associated with banning phones from school: (1) technology addition; (2) digital distraction; (3) cyberbullying; (4) surveillance capitalism; and (5) environmental sustainability of digital education."

In many respects, this is necessary and valuable but the topic of challenges and future trends in distance learning is an opportunity to explore the place of distance learning in a wider world where cultures and ideologies clash, where education and employment are no longer stable and secure, where universities and colleges are under unprecedented pressures, where the technologies and trends of educational technology represent a crowded and chaotic space and where a critical examination of distance learning is necessary to underpin its methods and its mission. This paper addresses in essence three questions, firstly, is the distance learning community clear about the definition and purpose of its work, secondly, what are global political, economic and technological pressures on the institutions of higher education delivering distance learning, and thirdly, what do typical innovations and trends in educational technology signify for distance learning? These are linked questions and the answers constitute challenging predictions and possibilities. The nature of these questions means there are no simple answers only a more complete understanding of a fluid, partial and complex environment within which education, including distance learning, cannot operate in ignorance or isolation."

This study evaluated the effectiveness of the Lexia (R) Core5 (R) Reading edtech program (Core5) on the Measures of Academic Progress (R) (MAP) Growth Reading (TM) and easyCBM oral reading fluency performance of students with reading or language-based disabilities in Grades K to 5. Core5 systematically addresses multiple reading domains and previously was effective in general education. We hypothesized treatment students using Core5 would outperform controls on the reading assessments. This was a cluster randomized effectiveness evaluation, with condition assignment by school (three treatment and two business-as-usual control schools). Participating students in Grades K to 5 (N = 115; n(Treatment) = 65) were flagged by their district as needing reading intervention and had Individualized Education Program (IEP) designations of specific learning disability, speech or language impairment, or developmental delay. Treatment students used Core5 to supplement Tier I instruction for an average of 58.76 minutes weekly for 24.58 weeks. Regressions revealed treatment students outperformed controls on MAP (B = 3.85, CI = 0.57-7.13, p = .022, d = .24), but there were no differences for oral reading fluency. MAP findings confirm edtech can effectively supplement reading instruction for this population."

In addition, there is a lack of a physical infrastructure within schools to allow the inclusion of educational technology tools which can give teachers assistance. However, there is a means of overcoming this problem by employing techniques to teach Computer Science without computers, which is called unplugged computing. In this paper, new didactic strategies were devised for disseminating computational thinking among elementary school teachers with the aid of unplugged computing. These strategies are based on computational algorithms mapped to unplugged computing activities. We develop a theoretical-practical workshop involving 37 public school teachers to analyze and test the proposed strategies. However, it was found that although the teachers were interested to learn the new skills required for unplugged computing, most of them stated that they would probably not replicate the knowledge acquired in their teaching practice."

        "The improvement of teachers' educational technology ability is one of the main methods to improve the management efficiency of colleges and universities in China, and the scientific evaluation of teachers' ability is of great significance. In view of this, this study proposes an evaluation model of teachers' educational technology ability based on the fuzzy clustering generalized regression neural network. Firstly, the comprehensive evaluation structure system of teachers' educational technology ability is constructed, and then the prediction method of teachers' ability based on fuzzy clustering algorithm is analysed. On this basis, the optimization prediction method of fuzzy clustering generalized regression neural network is proposed. Finally, the application effect of fuzzy clustering generalized regression neural network in the evaluation of teachers' educational technology ability is analysed. The results show that the evaluation system of teachers' educational technology ability proposed in this study is scientific and reasonable; fuzzy clustering generalized regression neural network model can better accurately predict the ability of teachers' educational technology and can quickly realize global optimization. According to the fitness analysis results of the fuzzy clustering generalized regression neural network model, the model converges after the 20th iteration and the fitness value remains about 1.45. Therefore, the fuzzy clustering generalized regression neural network has stronger adaptability and has been optimized to a certain extent. The average evaluation accuracy of fuzzy clustering generalized regression neural network model is 98.44%, and the evaluation results of the model are better than other algorithms. It is hoped that this study can provide some reference value for the evaluation of teachers' educational technology ability in colleges and universities in China."

        "3D printing is an emerging educational technology that is said to prepare learners for a more technologically designed world. In this review, 3D printing studies are analyzed to identify the dominant theoretical approaches and learning outcomes associated with 3D printing in education. Five theories are identified, including situated learning (Lave & Wenger, 1991), experiential learning (Kolb & Kolb Academy of Management Learning & Education, 4, 193-212, Kolb & Kolb, 2005), and critical making (Ratto in The Information Society, 27, 252-260, 2011), but concepts from constructionism (Papert & Harel Constructionism, 36, 1-11, 1991) and self-directed learning (Garrison Adult Education Quarterly, 48, 18-33, 1997; Knowles, 1975) are common amongst all approaches. Learning outcomes attributed to 3D printing include critical thinking, creativity, design thinking, and collaboration (Trust et al., 2018; Trust & Maloy Computers in the Schools: Interdisciplinary Journal of Practice, Theory, and Applied Research, 34, 253-266, 2017), with proponents arguing that the domain general outcomes go beyond knowing simply how to use a 3D printer. Given the identified, theoretical approaches, outcomes, and common barriers to use, recommendations are made for how educators approach and implement 3D printing in the classroom."

        "In the Mexican National Education System, what has been done during the last two decades in terms of acquisition and development of knowledge, skills and attitudes in students is insufficient. Evidence of this are the results obtained in the various national and international tests, such as the National Assessment of Academic Achievement in Schools (ENLACE), Quality Exams and Educational Achievement (EXCALE) and/or PISA (Program for International Student Assesment). These standardized measures have shown that the learning deficit of Mexican students in basic skills such as mathematics and reading comprehension are not adequate for a society with sustainable growth. Particularly, the results of the ENLACE test in Mathematics in the state of Campeche, Mexico, show insufficient achievements regarding the acquisition of knowledge and mathematical skills in elementary school and middle school students (ENLACE-2012 shows that 45.8% of students in elementary schools and 76.4% of students in middle School are located in an insufficient or elementary level). Considering all this arises the need to create support strategies for the teachinglearning process in the state of Campeche, Mexico in areas of mathematics and reading comprehension. As a response to the aforementioned situations, the Pilot Project: Educational Technology in Middle School was launched in 2016. This project has allowed us to identify and serve a population of students and teachers whose approach to conceptual mathemathics needs to be enriched. A technical and pedagogical organization of the expected learning and curricular standards of the Middle School Study Programs 2011 was carried out for the proper functioning and attention of the students according to their needs and with the aid of dynamic educational technology and low cost. The Educational Technology used was the operating system EndLess OS, which made it possible for teachers and students as well as to establish work methodologies focused on Active Teaching. Active teaching takes into account different teaching styles that may better engage the learners visually, aurally, verbally, physically and mentally. Active teaching helps create an exciting and engaging learning environment in the class, which helps build a motivation to attain more knowledge. EndLess OS is an operating systems with diverse functionalities that motivates students and teachers to work together interactively. Endless OS is designed to feel natural and intuitive, making it easy to use even if one has little or no computer experience. Endless is free to download, and software updates are automatically included. It's also virus-resistant, saving you money at every step. In the present paper we describe the implementation of this Educational Technology project for Middle Schools in the state of Campeche, Mexico and its preliminary results."

To respond for at more up-to-date training models, where technologies are a fundamental and basis new way of education, we have carried out an Innovation Project that has focused, on the one hand, on the integration of Educational Technology through use of the \"Virtual Classroom\", space offered by the Junta de Castilla y Leon to educational schools. On the other hand, relation to the learning of this educational technology, the development of a training program in colleges, within the variety of seminars framed in permanent teacher training channels (PTT) offered by the Teacher Training and Innovation Colleges Educational of regional government. And in this case, we have carried out a research Case Study with a mixed approach. This paper shows us the results of that period supported by mixed data sources, as well as the technological structure that at the end of the process, this experience and study has been providing us. How teachers value the use of educational technology, as well as their own training for their teaching practice and the needs that may be found in this context of IVTC."

        "Even though the recent influx of tablets in primary education goes together with the vision that educational technologies will revolutionize education, empirical results supporting this claim are scarce. The adaptive educational technology in this research is used daily in primary classrooms and includes teacher dashboards. While students practice on the tablet, the technology displays real-time data of learner progress and performance in teacher dashboards. This study examines how teachers use the dashboards during lessons applying the Verberts' learning analytic process model. Teacher dashboard consultations and resulting pedagogical actions were observed in mathematics lessons. In a following stimulated recall interview, a teacher was asked to elaborate on the knowledge he/she activated and his/her reasoning in interpreting the dashboard. The results indicate that teachers consult the dashboard on average 8,3 times per lesson, but great variation among teachers was found. Teachers activate existing knowledge about the class and students to interpret dashboard data. The pedagogical actions teachers take after dashboard consultation are mainly providing individual feedback and additional instruction. The results show that pedagogical actions preformed at teachers' own initiative are mostly directed to low ability students, whereas actions after consulting the dashboard are more directed at middle and high ability students. These results indicate that extracted learning analytics, in the form of teacher dashboards are indeed influencing teachers' pedagogical actions in daily classroom activities and may initiate behavior changes in teaching practices."

Historically the focus has tended to be on computers, but this has extended to include interactive whiteboards and tablets. As well as these technologies, which were originally designed for adults, there are devices specifically designed to support teaching and learning in the early years. These tend to be overlooked in the literature. This project aimed to find out if this reflected practice in early years settings. Participants from 20 early years settings in the North East of England were asked about 'educational technologies'. This term was deliberately not defined, the aim was to find out what they thought it meant. They were asked about the technology they had, and how it was being used. This provided an opportunity to explore whether their use of technology fit with their beliefs about teaching and learning. Findings suggest that technology is seen as more than computers and that technology is being used to support a broad range of activities in line with practitioners' pedagogical beliefs."

Jarrell et al.'s (Educational Technology & Research Development, 65, 1263-1284: 2017) findings indicate a strong relationship between outcome emotions and performance tasks: highest performing medical students had the most positive emotions. The authors suggested that medical students who fail and experience negative emotions could experience a loss of confidence and lead to dropping out of medical school. These results can be applied to teachers and administrators in K-12 settings as they make the shift to digital learning by including emotional assessments into the new digital learning platforms in order to address areas of emotional stress and teacher burnout before leading to attrition. This perspective makes suggestions of ways Jarrell et al.'s (Educational Technology & Research Development, 65, 1263-1284: 2017) findings could be a starting place for educational stakeholders to prioritize teachers' emotional well-being and offer an opportunity to provide intervention support in order to increase teacher self-efficacy in the shift to digital and possibly reduce teacher burnout."

In this chapter, the authors examine how they motivate a group of in-service teachers to use emerging technology tools for teaching and learning through their educational technology courses. For a few semesters in their educational technology courses, the authors have experimented with different ways to help both pre-service and in-service teachers overcome their challenges. Through trial and error, the authors have found strategies to help these digital immigrants to \"learn, unlearn, and relearn\" (Toffler, 1973) their acquired misconceptions and habits regarding technology. This inquiry is a distillation of these strategies."

The analysis helps inform what aspects of an educational technology support or hinder its adoption. First, the teachers valued flexibility. They used simulations in multiple ways for a variety of learning goals, primarily: understanding content, science process, and motivation. Second, they often chose implementations in which students control the simulation. Finally, they noted the value of specific affordances: visualization, seeing and controlling what's normally not possible, and manipulation."

Such is true for the education sector, especially in the Philippines. However, the seeming lack of action on issues concerning educational technology does not mean that educational institutions are not preparing for this snowball of educational technological changes. It must be emphasized that much preparation is required when adapting and adopting such innovations. This study aimed to begin planning stage of the enhancement of integration of technological advancements in classroom instruction in St. Paul College Pasig. Based on Parasumaran and Colby's (2001) Technology Readiness Index Model, the research evaluated around one hundred high school students' readiness based on the following technological beliefs: exposure to the features of the tablets and their optimism, discomfort, and insecurity on using tablets as a learning tool. Multiple regression analysis revealed that technological beliefs on reading experience and perception that the tablet is a better tool in making students learn affect significantly students' willingness to use tablets. As such, careful integration must be observed. It must still be emphasized that the tablet is just one of the tools that teachers can use in delivering lessons. As such, teachers must consider carefully the kind of materials, applications, and resources that will be used alongside the tablet. If educational institutions fail to fulfill the aforementioned significant technological beliefs, then the use of tablets as a learning tool may end up in vain."

This paper introduces cloud computing to the construction of the digital learning environment for its on-demand services with high reliability, scalability and availability in the distributed environment. Then a digital learning environment based on cloud computing (DLECC) is proposed, including the architecture, co-construction and sharing model, and incentive mechanism of DLECC. Finally, an Educational Technology Space (ETS) platform under the concept of DLECC is constructed and applied to the educational technology training for 110 teachers from primary and secondary schools. The experimental results demonstrate that the co-construction and sharing model and incentive mechanism of DLECC may provide meaningful learning support and interactive communities and promote the co-construction of befitting educational resources."

Existing literature on MOOCs generally does not predate 2008 in terms of historical foundations. However, this approach fails to look beyond the immediate past, assuming a brave new world in massive, open, distance learning which actually has existed for over a century. To address this shortsighted view, we present a brief history of educational radio, making the case for this medium as the first MOOCs and draw upon the literature around this medium to present a cautionary tale and lessons from which we might learn going forward."

        "One of the recent developments across education priorities in South Africa is the provision of information and communication technologies (ICTs) to schools to achieve the objectives of the country's National Development Plan (NDP) Agenda 2030. With the current focus on adoption of technology for teaching and learning, it is imperative to fully understand the perceptions and attitudes of teachers towards the use of ICT in their practice. Thus, this study investigated the teachers' perceptions and attitudes on the use of ICTs for teaching and learning. The findings are based on data collected through semi-structured interviews, journal reflections, and lesson observations. The results reveal that most teachers have positive perceptions towards the use of ICT for teaching and learning. It also indicated that the attitudes of teachers are varied based on the level of ICT training and support that they receive. The results of this research might be foremost to provide clear insights that could be contributing to the effective adoption of technology for teaching and learning."

We then explain our views on the meaning of teacher training. Secondly, we locate the objectives of the paper and the methodology used for its development based on evidence gathered in research and in our processes of analysis, reflection and teaching practice. Thirdly, we make an approach to the initial professional development of nursery, primary, secondary and university teachers centred on the notion of the Educational Technology they receive. Finally, we argue that in the initial teacher training programmes there is widespread overlapping between the concept of ET and the Information and Communication Technology that does not offer a comprehensive and integrated vision of the educational action as a whole, just as it offers a glimpse of the evolution of some myths about teacher training and technology."

        "The techniques and methods of teaching in Kenya have changed rapidly from traditional methods to contemporary, 21(st) century, technology-based approaches (Ashrafi et al., 2020). This development led to the introduction of several frameworks to support the application of numerous innovations in learning. However, the uptake of technology-supported teaching and learning, particularly in Christian Religious Education (CRE), remains low. Recent research indicates that the application and utilization of these technologies in CRE are minimal because of the perceptions of key stakeholders, including teachers, students, and school administrators. Educational technologies not only enhance the quality of learning but also contribute to deepening of religious knowledge and insights, fostering the development of moral values and beliefs. Therefore, this study investigated the relationship between students' perceptions and the uptake of educational technologies in CRE in Embu County, Kenya. This study sampled 300 students from 30 public secondary schools using a descriptive cross-sectional survey design and multistage random cluster sampling methods. Data were collected using a semi-structured questionnaire and analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. The results showed a significant weak positive relationship between students' perceptions and their uptake of educational technologies in CRE (r = 0.002, p = 0.01 and R-2 = 0.032). The findings of this study imply that initiatives aimed at increasing the uptake of educational technology should be specific, lucid, and tailored to the perceptions, ideas, opinions, experiences, and diverse needs of students."

To meet the needs of a new field, learning resources need to be developed for students to utilize in order to effectively engage with the content. The purpose of this work in progress is to discuss an established photovoltaics website (pveducation. org) that is being augmented towards becoming an effective PV education resource. With 3000 hits per day, pveducation. org engages learners in PV across the globe at a post-secondary content level. The authors of the site have recently enlisted educational and cognitive psychologists to enhance the website by infusing facets of educational technology. We intend to describe pveducation. org and provide an overview of the role educational technology has played in enhancing the website through the use of scaffolding and the inclusion of active-interactive tools. We contend that through this process the website can aid in the proliferation of effective learning of PV across the globe, and potentially aid new and well established engineering domains as they begin to embrace e-learning technology as learning resources."

        "During COVID-19 confinement, we observed numerous challenges in using educational technology in early childhood Science-Technology-Engineering-Arts-Mathematics (STEAM) education in Luxembourg. Thus, we designed a conceptual framework on parent-assisted remote teaching with active uses of educational technology supported by cycles of design-based research. After a previous study utilizing computer-aided design (CAD) software and three-dimensional (3D) printing in primary education, we used our initial findings to work with 12 early childhood students (ages 4-6), together with their teachers and parents in the second remote teaching period in Luxembourg. We created a STEAM modeling task with CAD software on robots and collected data through chat responses, messageboards, and online communication channels during a 3-week period. Here, we observed new roles in the parent-child relationship while learning STEAM in remote teaching with technology, and new opportunities in using educational technology overall in early childhood education. In this article, we have described findings that are likely to influence students' learning and parent-assisted teaching, in particular parents and students' perceptions and motivations, together with the way in which parents provide technical knowledge and support in remote early childhood STEAM education."

A qualitative thematic review of publications in these clusters revealed distinct context, goals, and topics. The largest cluster focused on predicting student success and failure, the second largest on using analytics to inform instructional design, and the third on concerns in implementing learning analytics systems. The authors suggest that further collaboration with educational technology researchers and practitioners may be necessary for learning analytics to reach its interdisciplinary goal. The authors also note that learning analytics currently does not often take place in K-12 settings, and that the burden of creating learning interventions still seemed to reside mainly with practitioners."

This review examined the effectiveness of technology-integrated literacy instruction in the classroom context for ELLs in Grades K-12. Thirty-six articles with 42 independent samples, based on a total of 4,354 participants, were included in this meta-analysis. Findings confirmed that technology-integrated instruction produced a positive, medium effect size (ES = 0.47) on literacy outcome as compared to traditional methods where no technology was involved. Moderator analyses were conducted with eight study features: grade level, learning context, study duration, intensity per week, total contact time, literacy outcome, pedagogical use, and teaching method. Learning context and literacy outcomes were found to be statistically significant to explain the variance of the effect sizes between the studies. These results advocate for the use of educational technology in literacy instruction for ELLs, regardless of literacy outcomes, pedagogical use, teaching methods, learning contexts, and grade levels. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed."

It is argued that these practices adhere to the neo-liberal logic of increased competition, standardization and testing, focusing on the individual child. There are a number of problems connected to these well-being enhancing technologies. These include the risk of producing passive and submissive subjectivities, that are understood as needing therapy by default; pathologizing the discomfort and struggles that are an inherent part of learning; the fragmentation of the child, focusing directly on the child rather than on the content matter at hand; producing an overly mechanic and technified pedagogy, focusing on output, as well as laying claim to much control in a risk-filled relational endeavor."

        "Advancements in IT and web-based technologies in the past two decades have the potential to revolutionize higher education, but realizing this potential seems to remain an elusive goal. Educators in diverse contexts are constantly exploring innovative technologies that claim to add value to traditional classroom knowledge delivery and impact the course delivery and design in colleges and universities. Even though the use of technology in higher education has substantially increased over the past few years, this use has been primarily limited to content management and delivery. There are, however, much broader strategic issues around alignment between the suite of learning technology tools promoted by universities and the academic plan, learning and teaching priorities, and expected graduate capabilities. To date many universities have not undertaken a full strategic assessment of the issues and implications of the introduction and sustaining of educational technologies and how these can best be utilized to fulfill academic policy and add value to student learning experiences and outcomes. We conducted a focus group of a number of innovative and early technology-adopter university teachers in which they discussed how educational technology tools (Ed-Tools) can be embedded into courses such that they develop students' analytical, sense-making and synthesis skills whilst enhancing their decision-making and delivery capabilities. This study highlights the importance of effectively using educational technology to support academic staff with their teaching and learning. A distinguishing factor of this study is that it looks at the issue from a holistic point of view, and not merely from the teachers', or the administration, or the students' point of view. We have compiled a list of barriers and also a list of recommendations. Findings of this exploratory study are presented intentionally in the form of a discussion paper rather than a traditional academic paper. It is hoped this presentation format opens up the issues for in-depth consideration by learning and teaching policy makers at universities and colleges."

        "The ongoing datafication of our social reality has resulted in the emergence of new data-based business models. This development is also reflected in the education market. An increasing number of educational technology (EdTech) companies are entering the traditional education market with data-based teaching and learning solutions, and they are permanently transforming the market. However, despite the current market dynamics, there are hardly any business models that implement the possibilities of Learning Analytics (LA) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to create adaptive teaching and learning paths. This paper focuses on EdTech companies and the drivers and barriers that currently affect data-based teaching and learning paths. The results show that LA especially are integrated into the current business models of EdTech companies on three levels, which are as follows: basic Learning Analytics, Learning Analytics and algorithmic or human-based recommendations, and Learning Analytics and adaptive teaching and learning (AI based). The discourse analysis reveals a diametrical relationship between the traditional educational ideal and the futuristic idea of education and knowledge transfer. While the desire for flexibility and individualization drives the debate on AI-based learning systems, a lack of data sovereignty, uncertainty and a lack of understanding of data are holding back the development and implementation of appropriate solutions at the same time."

In nursing education, the personal computer and the Internet facilitate teaching theoretical and practical knowledge. Objectives: Evaluate an educational technology known as Anatomy and Vital Signs with respect to content, appearance and usability. Method: This was a first stage evaluation by specialists to verify content and functioning, prior to a second validation as to learning by students. A methodological study in which instructional technologists (11 participants) and nursing specialists (17 participants) used the technology in an unguided manner and completed three questionnaires. The evaluation was measured by the difference between disagreement and agreement for each statement in the questionnaires. Results: Most of the items were positively evaluated at a level higher than 70% by most of the evaluators except for the following usability criteria: grouping by shape, minimum actions and user control, which did not attain the 70% agreement level among instructional technologists. Conclusion: The evaluation was useful to improve the technology and guarantee suitable product for nursing education. It may be a reliable educational tool for nursing education that applies technological resources. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved."

        "The aim of this study is to research modern educational technology (MET) at Faculty of Education - Palacky University Olomouc, Pedagogical University Tyrol and Trunojoyo University in Madura Indonesia as well as previous experience of future teachers with MET studying at these faculties. The basic question is which representatives of MET are available to the future teachers during their studies, and which representatives of MET future teachers actually employ in their studies. The main research tool was an online questionnaire which was distributed to students of the three faculties. The questionnaire was distributed electronically to students' email addresses, and to their FaceBook groups. The results of the research were subsequently recorded and evaluated based on respondents' answers. This article presents the results which were achieved via this research. Respondents from three different faculties responded that they define or classify MET as the basis for this concept while they only rarely have no idea about this term. At the same time, it has been discovered that there is a great deal of interest in a course (or a subject) that may focus on the use of MET in teaching.

        "In the last 20 years, neoliberal ideology has heavily influenced the U.S. education system, opening public education up to private corporations as a profitable business endeavor. In this paper, I inquire (Pierre, 2018, 2021) into educational technology (edtech) teacher ambassador programs through a blog post I wrote as a former second-grade teacher and ambassador for a prominent K-12 edtech company. I argue one way these exploitative spaces operate is through educators' attachment (Berlant, 2011) to the idea of being a good enough woman teacher (Pittard, 2015) fueled by neoliberal discourses of \"keeping up\" (Walkerdine, 2003). In other words, the material-discursive apparatus of these program spaces produces a \"cruel optimism\" for what we could be, rather than what we are, which in turn produces further profit for edtech companies. Overall, this paper grapples with how these programs may appear or feel mutually beneficial for educators, yet are often only monetarily beneficial for edtech companies and their investors."

Teacher training in educational technology, such as strategic value relevant, is pointing in the direction of promoting innovation and educational change for improvement. The analysis carried out lets you identify up to five major uncertainties in the technologies in the field of teacher training. It is the instability of the protocols of equipment for the schools, the innovation in the schools versus the development of technological artifacts, the management and control as an easement, the technological culture of the schools and the new roles and representations between the educational agents. Some considerations to the latter that stand out is reached the desirability of enhancing in the schools a technological culture sustained in attitudes and values such as freedom, democracy and critical spirit. Always from the logic of the shared reflection, and the cooperation between the various actors that shape the educational communities. In the development of our knowledge-based society is to be noted, also, a faculty adequate and timely formed in attitudes and ethical values, because in the exercise of the teaching will be basic pillars both independence, such as participation and the configuration of a critical citizenship."

        "Adult literacy and English as an Additional Language (EAL) programs are often challenged to find suitable and authentic reading texts and instructional materials for their students. Newsela PRO, an entirely online resource, provides high-interest fiction, timely news articles, and other nonfiction texts in both English and Spanish that focus on developing reading and critical thinking skills by providing students with five levels of reading difficulty. Although originally designed for younger learners, the use of Newsela PRO has recently expanded into adult literacy programs. This convergent mixed-methods study investigated the usability and instructional use of this educational technology in an intensive, precollege EAL program in a community college in the northeastern United States. This case study found that instructors felt the detailed reports provided by Newsela PRO enhanced their instruction and feedback and enabled them to differentiate instruction more effectively. Regardless of language-proficiency level, students found Newsela \"easy to very-easy-to-use.\" They were motivated to read more extensively and developed more confidence in their academic skills and English-language proficiency. These preliminary findings justify the additional cost of Newsela PRO as well as exploring its expanded use in other adult education, EAL, and literacy programs, especially Spanish-language literacy programs, both in the United States and internationally. As many adult and higher education programs were mandated to transition to distance learning exclusively during the recent COVID-19 pandemic, the effective instructional use of educational technology has become critical."

        "Because the educational technology research literature is so broad, it is difficult for researchers to acquire an accurate sense of the issues and trends across the entire field. There has not been any recent effort to synthesize or critically analyse the systematic reviews in the area of educational technology. This study analysed 73 systematic literature reviews, including meta-analyses, focused on the evaluation of technology in educational contexts, in order to holistically understand the impact of learning technology use across different aspects of evaluation. Among these reviews, the most common theme examined was learning outcomes (89%), followed by affective elements (45%), behaviours (25%), technological elements (21%) and teaching/pedagogical aspects (19%). Most of the reviews found that the use of technology improved learning outcomes and affective perceptions. Approaches involving interaction, gamification, constructivism, student-centred learning and feedback were most effective. The analysis highlighted the need for more reviews focusing on multiple aspects of learning technology evaluation, on school level education and on the use of technology in naturalistic (non-interventional) settings. Critical reflections are also cast on the methods used to conduct systematic reviews in the educational technology field."

        "This chapter describes the use of educational technology for enhancing student learning at the School of Electrical Engineering and Telecommunications (EE&T) at the University of New South Wales (UNSW). Over the past decade, the school has introduced and trialled various technology-based approaches in the form of electronic whiteboard-based lectures for remote teaching, voice-over power-point screencasts using tablet PCs for tutorial problems, pre-recorded dynamically annotated lecture material delivered initially via DVDs and later hosted on the cloud as support material for live lectures, distributed laboratories capable of real-time interaction via video, audio and digital annotations, and most recently, the use of iPads to aid in lecture delivery. The impact of these approaches is evaluated in this chapter using student surveys over multiple years, some of which are still on-going. The results of these surveys show that technology-based approaches have a positive impact on student learning experiences. In particular, the students found that the video capture of lectures with appropriate dynamic annotation as support material allowed for flexible learning to suit individual styles."

The growth in educational technology is also influencing academic institutions to redefine their endeavors in terms of producing learning while providing instructions. With the growing demand for higher education such endeavors are crossing the physical boundaries of many countries. We are using online and hybrid learning models to attract traditional, distance and international students. A major component of this model is the web-based course management system that provides an environment for teaching/learning and interaction 24/7. This model optimally combines interactive-classroom, web-based lectures and traditional instructions and has successfully offered courses at SUNY-Fredonia with students registering from around the globe. This model is presented and the opportunities and challenges of web technologies in education are discussed."

        "Purpose The purpose of this study was to better understand K-12 district leaders' reasoning and processes for selecting and deploying EdTech instructional products, including which, if any, types of data are used to support decision-making. Design/methodology/approach This multisite case study of educational technology (EdTech) decision-making comprises five purposely selected districts at the leading edge of EdTech innovation. The unit of analysis was a recent purchase they had made of an instructional, classroom-oriented digital product (defined as a product used by teachers and/or students in the classroom for the purposes of student learning). The key leader heading up the purchase was interviewed, as were other leaders and a teacher who were involved in the decision-making process. Findings The processes districts used to make their purchasing decisions involved teachers, district leaders and technical specialists who considered usability, usage data and alignment with student learning and interoperability, respectively. While in some cases there were plans to collect data on student learning outcomes, districts did not uniformly emphasize that in their decision-making processes. Instead, the type of educational technology tool that was purchased influenced whether or not districts planned to seek out student-level outcome data as evidence of the product's efficacy. For the purchases associated with access to content, school leaders considered usage or log data generated by the program itself as sufficient indication that the program is \"working.\" Where the software's functionality encompassed skill development, leaders stated future plans to look at student-level outcomes as a means for judging if the program \"worked.\" Originality/value Few accounts of district decision-making about the adoption of educational technology innovations are present in the literature. These five cases provide insight into the role evidence plays in decisions to adopt educational technology."

        "With the fast paced improvements in smart devices such as tablets and smartphones, many schools in the developed countries are trying to improve the traditional pedagogical methods by harnessing smart learning technology for different purposes. In this paper, we proposed the use of a smart novel educational technology to immerse the students in the learning process by engaging as many of the students' senses as possible through the creation of interactive elements and entertaining features. This process is also called edutainment, combining both education and entertainment, and it works by making students learn subconsciously in an immersive manner. The aim of this paper is to demonstrate how an immersive augmented reality application can work in conjunction with Arabic schoolbooks in an attempt to improve Arabic literacy for children in the UAE. The reason for this is that children in the UAE are being exposed to English most of the time and, as a consequence, gradually losing their mother tongue. A focus field-study was then conducted on two groups of Grade 1 students to get a pre-understanding in the impact of such educational technology, targeted for younger learners, in language literacy education."

        "Educational Technology (EdTech) plays a significant role in enabling learners with disabilities to access learning at school and reduce educational and social exclusion. It also enables them to enjoy the benefits of a full school curriculum and to participate in activities in different educational arrangements. The purpose of this review was to address the existing evidence of how EdTech is being used to support learners with disabilities in order to inform future research and policymaking. It sought to contribute to an evidence base of ways to reduce barriers to learning drawing on a systematic methodology to gather evidence pertaining to access to EdTech for primary school learners with disabilities aged 6-12 years. After a thorough examination of the literature, the final sample comprised 51 published articles (43 peer-review and 8 conference papers). The review revealed examples of positive outcomes of EdTech interventions being used, particularly in special schools; however, the evidence of their efficacy is weak. The use of EdTech for learners with disabilities in low- and middle-income countries requires further, robust and long-term research that considers the involvement of learners, pedagogy and curriculum design in order to understand its impact on improving educational experiences of children with disabilities."

        "That pathology and normality exist on a complex spectrum of bodily manifestation is an enduring problem at the heart of the philosophy, anthropology and history of medicine. As the primary locus for the reproduction of medicine, medical schools are important sites for cultivating knowledge of what is normal and what is not. Here students come to engage with the slippery concepts of normality and pathology in collaboration with a wide range of educational technologies - the cadavers, plastic models, illustrations and diagnostic tools which corral student knowledge of the body in both health and disease. These technologies are not universally employed across medical faculties, and variations in their use contributes to various constructions of pathology and normality. Ethnographic observation and historical research in medical faculties in Hungary, the Netherlands and Ghana, shows that educational practices are shaped by the epistemic traditions which manifest in the material environment of the medical school, and that these different sociomaterial settings contribute to inconsistent notions of normalcy. Although educational technologies often tend towards fixity in their representations of the body in health and disease, medical school practice in the north of Ghana resists the imposition of the often alien standards typically found in teaching materials imported from Europe or North America. By teaching around and beyond these materials, Ghanaian educators also challenge their assuredness and the intellectual history of contemporary medicine."

        "This chapter describes an approach to promote the development and spread of educational technology innovations. The approach nurtures a culture of innovation and reflective practice of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) use for teaching and learning amongst teachers under Singapore's 3rd Masterplan for ICT in Education. It discusses system support, processes, and strategies which a centralised agency, like the Ministry of Education Headquarters (MOE HQ), employs to encourage schools and teachers to participate in ground-up experimentations of ICT-mediated innovations, translation, and spreading. This chapter discusses cultivating eduLab communities to facilitate spreading and adopting effective educational technology innovations across schools. The chapter describes processes for translating research ideas into innovations for scaling, by (1) scanning ideas, (2) prototyping innovations through projects, and (3) spreading or scaling up through communities. It elaborates considerations for evaluating innovations and strategies to scale up innovations. The chapter proposes that scaling includes explicit knowledge and tacit dimensions of teachers adapting innovations for contexts. Thus, communities and champions are drivers for spreading. The chapter extends the principle of \"structured informality\" to describe top-down supports for bottom-up efforts, that is, how system structures leverage informality in communities, where HQ officers and teachers dialogue to build understandings, adapt core principles to contexts and develop champions who further drive diffusion. The chapter proposes design principles for cultivating communities based on literature from communities of practice and discusses this using three case examples. It concludes with how design principles align with the principle of structured informality to use communities as mechanism for scaling."

        "This paper provides an overview of the status of educational technology in Turkey. In the face of severe social and economic challenges, many developing nations, including Turkey, are looking to education as a potential remedy. Recognizing that in an increasingly technology-dependent world, information and communications technology skills and knowledge are critical in order to compete in the global marketplace, Turkey is firmly committed not only to improving its education system, but also to incorporating the use of educational technologies into the instructional strategy and curriculum used in schools. This is a critical initiative because, as research shows, technology-enriched educational environments can provide students with significantly expanded learning opportunities, which are linked with increased levels of academic achievement. However, like many other developing countries, Turkey is struggling to overcome a number of serious barriers to full technology integration at the classroom level, the most significant of which is non-compliance on the part of teachers. With respect to technology use in education, teachers are consistently failing to utilize technological tools for instruction purposes, for a variety of reasons. Turkey must address these reasons in order to ensure that the agenda of technology adoption into schools, an enormously expensive undertaking, does not fail."

        "Educational technology offers unique affordances as a learning tool and delivery system for enhancing and personalizing instruction. Over the past two decades, efforts by school districts and states to infuse technology into everyday K-12 education through one-to-one laptop initiatives have rapidly proliferated. In this paper, I examine such initiatives from studies in the literature and from my own research, starting with the Apple Classroom of Tomorrow in the mid-1980 ' s and continuing today with comprehensive mixed-method evaluations in school districts. Drawing from this work, I focus on several themes that create both challenges and opportunities for technology infusion to occur in more effective and sustainable ways. These include: (a) conceptualizing technology as an educational tool and delivery system, not as a \"treatment\" in itself; (b) defining and communicating to stakeholders what proximal and long-term outcomes the technology initiative is (and is not) expected to promote; (c) not over-promising impacts on student achievement on standardized assessments where technology applications are directed primary toward other educational goals; and (d) conducting ongoing evaluation studies to provide evidence of program implementation progress and effectiveness at different phases of the initiative."

        "Educational Technology (ET) is a systematic way of designing, implementing and evaluating the total process of learning and teaching in terms of specific objectives based on research on human learning and communication and employing a combination of human and non-human resources to bring about more effective instruction. Realizing the importance of Media and Educational Technology in India, the National Policy on Education in its modified document-1992 states that Modern communication technologies have the potential to bypass several stages and sequences in the process of development encountered in earlier decades both the constraints of time and distance at once become manageable. In order to avoid structural dualism, modern educational technology must reach out to the most distant areas and deprive sections of beneficiaries simultaneously with the area of comparative affluence and ready availability. Further, it has stated that Educational Technology will be employed in the spread of useful information, the training and retraining of teachers, to improve quality education, sharpen awareness of art and culture, and inculcate abiding values etc., both in the formal and non-formal sectors. Maximum use will be made of the available infrastructure. Today, India engages nearly 5.5 million teachers spread over around one million schools to educate about 202.5 million children. A look at the data and analyses on the growth of teacher education organizations in the country indicates that the number of these institutions have increased from 2051 in 2000 to 4550 in 2005 and to about 8000 in 2012. The orientation of teachers and teacher educators in such a huge system at regular intervals is a challenging task. Covering all such teachers and teacher educators only through face-to-face training and orientation programmes is virtually impossible. In the past, the cascade model incorporating multitier training stages for the organization of orientation programmes has been used as a strategy for training and re-training of a large number of teachers and teacher educators in our country. The Special Orientation of Primary School Teachers (SOPT) and Programme for Mass Orientation of School Teachers (PMOST) have been organized successfully by adopting such strategy. This model involves successive stages of training. The person who is trained in the earlier stage acts as a resource person for training of participants in the subsequent stages. In this mechanism of training there is transmission loss of information and possibly emphasis in different stages of multi-tier programmes. In view of this limitation of the cascade model, it is considered that the orientation and training of teachers/teacher educators through distance mode with direct communication with experts could be a better option. In the recent times, Media and Educational Technology are being employed to revitalize the entire education system all over the world. Now, the audio and video broadcasting and video-conferencing facilities are available in almost every states and Union Territories, UTs of our country as a result of launching of a series of satellites by Indian Space Research Organization. In our space programme, a satellite is exclusively meant for the educational purposes in the country."

The author proposes the principles of adaptation of foreign educational experience on the basis of sociogenetic approach, as well as the conditions and stages of implementing foreign teaching experience in the national higher education system. The use of the socio-genetic approach to adapt the experience of foreign language training of students will undoubtedly contribute to its effective use in domestic universities and accelerate the modernization of Russian higher professional education."

This paper examines the educational obstacles like time to prepare materials and lessons for quality technology-rich lessons, policies and security restrictions, access to resources, and the level of comfort to use technology. Based on examining the type one and two obstacles, the goal is to gain a greater understanding as to why there is a disconnect between the seemingly common educational belief, that technology can and must be used in the twenty-first century classrooms, and actual classroom practices through evaluating the mentioned obstacles."

        "In this article, the authors argue that educational technology is chiefly and increasingly being used as a tool for the privatization of education and the commodification of people by way of top down evaluative structures put in place by governments in collusion with neoliberal interests. This analysis began as a study that sought to illuminate the reasons why teachers in Taiwanese technical colleges have been reluctant to integrate educational technologies for actual instruction. However, what the authors actually found was that teachers in Taiwan are experiencing a forced obsession with top down evaluations and these evaluations are locking teachers in what may be called an amplifying causal loop. By looking up the proverbial food chain of the top-down evaluations, the authors found socio-political and economic forces at work that were less Taiwanese and more global in scope and character and less about teachers and classrooms and more about the rise of educational administration for neoliberal advancement. This article argues that a collusion between neoliberal interests, an obsession with evaluation, and the uninterrogated implementation of educational technologies are giving rise to processes that are wreaking havoc on the Taiwanese education system and similar processes are at work throughout the world."

        "Innovative technology is a must have in the educational environment as a requirement to help students to become part of this technological global society of the 21st century. Educational leaders at both the secondary and post-secondary education levels have to make important decisions about innovative technologies, such as the kind of technology needed for specific subject matter with relation to its learning goals, the development of a budget making process, and the creation of training for faculty to master innovative technology. Some issues of educational innovative technology include the impact of enhanced delivery of courses or programs, the analysis and purchasing of course management systems, and the development of faculty. This monogram discusses several legal concerns arising from adoption or use of new educational technologies that educational leaders are confronted with on a daily basis. Some of these concerns involve cyber-truancy, cyberbullying, copyright law in online and distance education, and the use or non-use of assistive technology for students with learning disabilities. Furthermore, a case study is also presented exemplifying the importance of legal literacy for educational leaders as regarding the use of educational technologies, as well as the importance and implications of their decision-making processes regarding legal issues that may arise from the use of such technologies."

Using a qualitative approach, 10 senior leaders (i.e., chief information officers, superintendents, etc.) were interviewed to reveal the most important factors driving technology acquisition, governance procedures, and assessment measures utilized by school districts in their implementation of educational technology. The data were transcribed and submitted to \"computer-assisted NCT analysis\" (Friese, 2014). The findings show that senior leaders are making acquisitions that are not aligned with current scholarship, that districts struggle to use data-driven decision-making to support the governance of educational technology spending, and that districts do not have effective assessment measures in place to determine the efficacy of a purchased technology. The study is meant to serve as an informative resource for senior leaders and to present research-based approaches to technology procurement."

In Argentina scenarios were developed from the use of computers in schools. The profiles changed according to pedagogical purposes, educational policies and mass access to netbooks for students and teachers. From a Latin American perspective we wonder whether cyber utopias alone open new avenues of development. The socio-political and economic conditions lead to conceiving education as an unfinished and unending process. But it is important that educational institutions are open to an expanded education. In all these processes the teachers still teach, otherwise, and increasingly virtual environments. Teacher training in educational technology involves pedagogical-didactic approach, critical-reflective and creative-procedural dimensions, based on disciplinary epistemology, the socio-cognitive subject particularities, and being located at institutional and social context."

        "Despite significant initiatives to improve education globally, policy makers and researchers are concerned about literacy outcomes in developing countries, as students lack basic literacy skills even after many years in schooling. Educational technology has been championed as a potential solution to low-quality education in developing countries, yet little rigorous research on this topic exists. Since Covid-19 has caused enormous global disruption and teachers have been forced to adopt technology globally, research into the effectiveness of using technology for teaching literacy in low-income contexts is vital. This systematic review of the literature analyses and synthesises the range of international research available on educational technology to improve reading in developing countries. This review includes primary qualitative, quantitative and mixed methods studies, which were analysed using thematic synthesis. The review concludes that there is some suggestive evidence that reasons for the success of educational technology literacy interventions may include ongoing teacher professional development, interactive multimedia features, and a focus on phonics and progressive reading skills. The current limited research base supports technology designs that are adaptive, engaging, and child-centred, utilising software that can differentiate for students' levels. Engaging the community using context-specific resources and incorporating the technology into a broader literacy programme and pedagogy, were also features highlighted in multiple studies. However, with a limited number of studies the strength of the evidence is weak; therefore, definitive conclusions cannot be made. The findings provide some suggestive evidence that could guide future research.Rationale for this studyWhy the new findings matterImplications for research and practiceThis systematic review addresses the gap in current research into which types of educational technology are effective for the teaching of reading in developing countries. By synthesising the findings of qualitative, quantitative and mixed methods primary studies, this review presents tentative recommendations for policy makers and future research.The findings present specific features of effective educational technologies that could be used by policy makers to improve literacy outcomes. This is directly relevant for the millions of students in developing countries who lack literacy skills even after many years in school. Educational technology is widely used and promoted as a solution for improving educational or literacy outcomes in developing countries, yet little rigorous research exists. This systematic review addresses this by synthesising existing research and highlighting areas for future research. Since Covid-19 caused teachers to adopt technology globally, research into the effectiveness of using technology for teaching literacy in low-income contexts is vital.This systematic review synthesises current research so that policy makers have guidelines when designing interventions. The review provides a comprehensive map of existing literature and gaps for researchers. Based on the findings from this systematic review, policy makers are encouraged to consider how technology engages students through multimedia and interactive features, is adapted to the local context and language, and is differentiated to students' different ability levels. Policy makers should also consider how technology supports student learning through the scaffolding of specific reading skills with a holistic connection to a broader literacy programme, teacher training and the local curriculum. Since little quality data exists in this area, these recommendations for policy are tentative, and it is recommended future research further explore some of the promising features that were found in numerous successful interventions.Context and implications"

        "At the beginning of the twenty-first century, Spanish scholars started to pay particular attention to the history of schools' material culture, defining this as \"etnohistoria de la escuela\". Reflections on the \"materiality of schooling\" and \"school heritage\" continued in the years that followed. Teaching tools or, more widely, \"school objects\" challenge the concepts of space, time and sociality. They speak of school practices, cultural history, and ideology. School artefacts are either handmade products created by pupils and teachers, or the school equipment that is made up of commercial products, which also respond to an industrial and economic logic, linked to the achievement of mass schooling. The aims and means of education are intermingled, but if educational theories have long attracted scholars' attention, the history of educational objects can be further explored from different angles. This paper shows the connection between educational models and pedagogical tools, but also between ideology and the cultural dimension of pedagogical objects, and between economy and pedagogical artefacts. ISCHE 43 was dedicated to the histories of educational technologies and the articles in this special issue of Paedagogica Historica represent some of the leading papers presented at the conference, which was held for the first time as a hybrid event at the Catholic University of Milan from 31 August to 6 September 2022."

        "This mixed methods study examines the extent to which the use, and intensity of use, of educational technology is associated with improved academic outcomes for English language learners (ELLs) in both English/Spanish bilingual and traditional English-only classrooms. We also explore the role of teacher capacity and practice in integrating educational technology by student population and instructional setting across six schools serving a student population of predominately low-income ELLs. Building on limited prior work on technology integration with elementary school ELLs, the analysis draws on district administrative data, teacher surveys, classroom observations, and teacher interviews. In econometric analyses of academic outcomes associated with exposure to varying intensities of technology use, we identified positive associations of technology use in reading, starting at around 40 min of weekly use in bilingual classrooms versus 1 h of weekly use in traditional classrooms. While the average reading effect size topped out at 0.20 for students with 2 h of weekly technology use in reading in traditional classrooms, the reading effect size continued to rise in bilingual classrooms to over 0.50 for students in classrooms using technology for 3 h a week in reading. We also found that technology use in reading where teachers were observed more frequently using blended instructional strategies was more effective for students in bilingual classes than technology use in math. Our findings suggest that alignment of technology with constructivist teaching strategies, which connect student learning to culturally relevant experiences and provide opportunities for inter-activity and collaboration, is key to transforming the learning process and outcomes of emergent bilingual students."

Data sources included (a) 17.9 million Facebook page posts by K-12 educational institutions in the U.S., (b) 131,760 tweets to the #EdTech hashtag on Twitter, and (c) 29,636 educational technology articles in the Scopus database. We provide a variety of descriptive results in the form of participation frequency charts, keyword matches, URL domain link counts, co-occurring hashtags, tweet text word trees, and common word and bigram frequencies. Results from the analysis of Facebook posts indicated that (a) schools increasingly used the platform over time, (b) the pandemic increased frequency (but not the nature) of use, (c) schools are progressively sharing more media, information, and tools, and (d) some of these tools align with trends identified by Weller (2020) while others do not. Analysis of tweets indicated that (a) discussions in 2020 revolved around \"remote learning\" and related topics, (b) this emphasis shifted or morphed into \"elearning\" and \"online learning\" as the year progressed, (c) shared posts were primarily informational or media-based, and (d) the space was heavily directed by a relatively small group of Superusers. Last, analysis of articles in Scopus indicated that (a) online learning is historically the most-researched topic in the field, (b) the past decade reflects a shift to more \"open\" and \"social\" topics, and (c) there seems to be a lag or disconnect between emergent high-interest technologies and research. Taken together, we conclude that these results show the field's preparation for addressing many challenges of 2020, but propose that, moving forward, we would be better served by embracing greater philosophical plurality and better addressing key issues, including equity and practicality."

        "Software development for educational technology requires consideration of conceptual understandings and theoretical perspectives addressed in a variety of academic disciplines. Effective software design has roots in both studies of human cognition and in understandings of information acquisition processes found in the various subjects taught in school. Content and instructional design must address specific standards and teaching/learning strategies highlighted in the various school curricula. To arrive at a successful end product, all this together needs to be translated onto a computer screen in a format that is usable, attractive, and beneficial for a specific target group of users. This translation is studied in the fields of Computer Assisted Instruction and Software Design. In our paper, we illustrate this complex, interdisciplinary process by describing development of an online mathematics assessment tool designed to provide curriculum-based measurement (CBM). We describe the data collection used in our study with -7500 students from 6 states of the USA. The study was conducted in order to determine K-12 national average performance levels on this test."

        "Many in higher education are calling for a re-think of teaching and learning principles. The global pandemic de-stabilized foundational assumptions that guided pedagogy for many higher education practitioners. One such assumption is the value of the physical classroom for student engagement. Advances in educational technology and online learning practice have become immediately indispensable. And they have forced a reckoning for traditionalists. This qualitative narrative study examines the stories of undergraduates while studying online during the campus lockdown at a liberal arts college in Bangkok, Thailand. Their stories were produced into animated clips, which are featured in this article. They provide a uniquely vivid illustration of their learning engagement, as well as critical reflections on the value of the campus experience during a forced absence of it. While the study finds that students in some ways became more self-disciplined, it also reflects a refreshed awareness of the importance of ritual and shared physical space, in spite of the allure of educational technology."

        "The existence of technology based tools such as smartphones and tablets has become the pillars of life for the majority of Generation-Z students. Thus when these batch of students are involuntarily introduced into a boring learning environment filled with hand written words on the chalkboards as well as tech based learning using word processors and slide shows that feels tactless. Hence, comes the need of identifying a new form of educational technology approach. Gamification; with just the use of game elements as opposed to a full-fledged game has the potential to not only ease the burden of tutors in creating a suitable learning environment but in keeping the students engaged and motivated in learning. Based on this, a research was carried out using the gamified learning approach with two groups of students in a boarding school in a southern state in Malaysia. A total of 28 students from the experimental group and 26 students' from the control group participated and completed the 7 weeks' intervention. Pre and post intervention exam questions were given to students. Based on the analysis it was concluded that there is a significant difference when it comes to the post test results of the experimental group. This showed that the gamified based learning managed to have a substantial impact on the attainment level of the students."

Results show that teachers showed an appreciation for theories and an awareness for the need of theories in guiding technology use. Teachers also connected theories with technology use. The learning of theories equipped teachers with theoretical guidance and justifications for the use of technology. The participating teachers were also able to evaluate pedagogical approaches toward the use of technology based on their learning. The study addressed the importance of theoretical understanding towards the use of technology and has implications for policies and practice regarding teacher education and professional development regarding the use of educational technology."

        "Vocational education taking place in the dual contexts of workplace and school often lacks integration of concrete experiences with theoretical knowledge. The interplay between workplace and school contexts and their often antagonistic priorities call for a specific model that transforms these divergences into learning opportunities and connects different forms of knowledge into an integrated body of knowledge that contributes to developing vocational competence. This paper presents a multidimensional pedagogical model, called the 'Erfahrraum', for the design and implementation of educational technologies as a way to foster this integration in initial dual vocational education and training (VET). The 'Erfahrraum' model informs the design of shared spaces for capturing and reflecting on experiences made in different contexts in which VET takes place. The model particularly emphasises the importance of shared reflection processes to turn concrete experiences into relevant integrated knowledge. Examples of implementations in different professions using a range of different technologies illustrate the power of the 'Erfahrraum' model."

        "This research explored teacher in-school educational technology use for middle grades instruction. A quantitative investigation examined adoption of technology, sources of acquired skills, use frequencies, perceived effectiveness, and barriers to integration. A total of 796 participants employed across a Mid-Atlantic state from various demographic backgrounds responded to the researcher-developed questionnaire. Findings revealed document creation and presentation programs were most commonly used and perceived as the most effective tools to enhance student learning. Teachers voiced displeasure for video and audio-editing software, as well as social networking. Participants indicated personal trial and error as the most likely way to acquire new knowledge. Teacher perspectives offer unique insight and provide an opportunity to further discussion of educational technologies. By better understanding educators' use of technology in the middle grades, current teachers and administrators, as well as teacher preparation instructors, may design more reflective curricula. It is recommended that future research be performed on a multi-state or regional basis to investigate technology integration at the elementary and young adult grade levels to best prepare future teachers and keep current professionals abreast of research-based best practices."

This paper reports on the use of laptops by 71 patients at the hospital, who represented a range of ages, gender, home location and type of hospital admission (short, long, infrequent and frequent). Surveys revealed these technologies were used throughout the hospital with use varying according to the stage of development; however, restrictions to academic and social networking sites were problematic. The results highlight how educational technologies can provide access to flexible learning opportunities and socialising for hospitalised children and young people."

Data were collected via a self-report questionnaire and analyzed through structural equation modeling. Model comparison results showed that the third hypothesized model fit the data best. Specifically, perceived usefulness, technology self-efficacy, and facilitating conditions had direct positive effects on attitudes toward use of technology, while perceived usefulness, attitudes toward use of technology, and experience of technology use showed a positive influence on intention to use technology. This study enriches our understanding of technology acceptance by extending consideration to under-studied preservice L2 Chinese teachers in China. Implications for schools and teacher educators are also discussed."

The article deals with mastering of educational technologies in the course of future teachers' pedagogical training. Technologies are didactic devices that should be diverse. The aim of a university teacher is to provide conditions for these technologies understanding and mastering. The task of a student as a future teacher is to realize the importance of the diversity of interactive technologies, to learn how to apply them in real educational activities and later on to understand what technology is the best one, taking into account the abilities, inclinations and opportunities of school children and also the peculiarities of the subject matter in teaching of which an interactive technology is planned to be applied. A future teacher should be acquainted not only with new knowledge, but also with new methods of teaching that allow each learner to be involved in an active cognitive process, to work in cooperation, to solve various problems in team. That's why interactive technologies arouse such interest. They include: a project technology and educational quest, a technology of critical thinking development, case-technologies. They contribute to the development of cognitive abilities of both students and schoolchildren, to the activation of their thinking potential."

The aim of this study was to find out whether embodied educational technologies such as robot tutors can also yield similar results with adult learners. An experiment was conducted in a secondary education mathematics classroom, where 15 students (of ages 17 to 20) worked on math exercises in two conditions. In one condition, a Nao robot was present as a math tutor to read the questions, collect answers and provide feedback. In the other condition, students practiced math exercises on a laptop which is a non-social and non-embodied technology. Results indicated that students in secondary education do not seem to favor using a robot tutor over traditional technologies. This implies that there is a difference between children and adults in the way they experience this technology in its current state-of-the-art for their education."

        "Purpose: The purpose of the chapter is to analyze mobile learning for improving students' English proficiency using personal electronic devices and to assess English language teaching and learning supported by electronic media and tools. Design/methodology/approach: The authors determine the definition ofmobile learning, the classification of devices, the advantages and disadvantages of mobile learning. They consider mobile learning to be an advanced educational technology both in a classroom and for extracurricular lessons for Higher School students of technical specialties. The educational standards of Higher School require solving the problem of future specialists' professional communicative skills development and the authors analyze the ability of mobile learning to meet this task because digital electronic revolution keeps us connected with almost everyone around the world and makes necessary information available anywhere, at any time. Mobile learning can be applied inside and outside the classroom using personal mobile devices. Mobile education extends the boundaries of the traditional pedagogical methods with the effective integration of technology creating a favorable learning environment. Findings: It deserves attention that the paper is written completely on the results obtained by the authors during their practicalwork. They created and tested the exercises with mobile learning applying on the base of \"Moodle mobile\" which helps teachers to meet the requirements of the constantly changing modern society demands for the professional education development. The exercises selection and systematization gives teachers an opportunity to apply them in their everyday work. They analyzed mobile teaching methods as an advanced educational technology, gave a scientific review of the mobile education benefits and its drawbacks and suggested the recommendations on the new online practice which is used in the educational environment of technical Higher Schools. The authors underlined the disadvantage that there are some teachers who have not got enough skills to work with personal electronic devices. As for students, they feel free to use them for mobile learning because it enables them to improve theirEnglish proficiency. Originality/value: Using the tasks and exercises on the base of \"Moodle mobile\" during the lessons, the authors really confirmed the original concept of the new mobile learning teaching methods applying in the educational activity of technical Higher Schools' students. The authors assessed the authenticity of the practically obtained results, offered practical recommendations for the mobile learning teaching methods, and proved the necessity to integrate the mobile devices into Higher Schools' educational programs for educational technologies modernization with the purpose to improve the English language fluency level of the future specialists."

This study aims to investigate the relationship between students' achievement goals and what they prefer as \"personalized problems\" in computer-adaptive tests. We theoretically contrast achievement goals with developing competency through mastery and demonstrating competency through performance goals. We asked elementary and secondary school students to work on a computer-adaptive test and to complete questionnaires about what they prefer as \"personalized problems\" in computer-adaptive tests. The results revealed that while mastery goals positively predicted preference for challenging problems, performance goals positively predicted preference for problems that guaranteed students' success. Moreover, only the preference for challenging problems positively predicted the intention to take computer-adaptive tests in the future. These results suggest that simply introducing a computer-adaptive test into the classroom may not be effective. We discuss how educational technologies should be integrated into human teaching activities."

Public awareness and knowledge of alien invasive species is required of residents, teachers, tree professionals and other stakeholders to enable the early detection and a 'stop the spread' strategy in the management of alien invasive species. The research on public awareness and knowledge about five selected tree pests and pathogens revealed that 83.30% of respondents have no knowledge. Respondents were asked to show their practical knowledge by matching the pest or pathogen with the symptoms on a tree, and only 4-11% were able to give correct answers. The public's attitude towards plant health issues is positive and almost all the respondents only buy their plants from registered nursery or distributors. Over half do not buy imported plants and are aware of the likelihood that more invasive alien species could come into our country and region via this pathway. Respondents use multiple sources to gain their knowledge regarding tree pests and pathogens. The most frequent sources used are the internet, face-to-face learning from educational establishments (lectures, seminars etc.), newspapers and trade journal articles. Respondents are motivated to gain knowledge about pests and pathogens and the pathways of their introduction, from the preferred formats of: the internet, TV programmes, printed brochures and books. Educational technology should be applied in order to facilitate education and lifelong learning, raise public awareness about pests and pathogens and improve professional practices."

At a rural Tanzanian primary school, a number of XO-1 based educational projects and workshops have been conducted since 2008. By analyzing the reports from those projects and workshops, as well as from related studies, this paper identified a number of working practices. Several aspects seem to be especially prevalent. Firstly, various viewpoints to contextualization were widely recognized in our studies, as well as in other studies. Educational technology initiatives need to be based on need pull rather than technology push. Secondly, projects need action research-based components for systematically collecting and increasing understanding about well-functioning practices that may be unique to each environment. Thirdly, educational technology projects, including e-learning projects, should be open for a wider spectrum of educational factors such as contingent constructivism: the sentiment of well functioning teaching should be appreciated."

        "Writing in English, as one type of language output, has drawn more and more attention from scholars in applied linguistics in recent years. Within this context, there is obviously much room for improvement of traditionals method of teaching English writing. The advancement in the Internet and other educational technology has furnished an opportunity for reform of writing pedagogy. Guided by constructivism theory and process approach, the present paper attempts to explore a new approach to English writing in colleges with the aid of the network and multimdia technology. The practice indicates that the approach is more conducive to improving students' English writing skills, as well as the overall language proficiency compared with traditional one. The approach is also helpful to promote cooperative learning among students."

This study aims to establish a mobile-assisted language teaching (MALT) model by analyzing two small scale studies involving the mobile application, LINE, to assist in ESL learners' general and English for specific purposes (ESP) learning. Regardless of length of the mobile-assisted language instructions in the two cases, the results show that the students made progress in their English performance and their English learning motivation; thus enhancing their attitudes. The MALT model generated from the two cases can aid teachers and researchers in the fields of ESL, ESP, TESOL, and educational technology in enhancing their teaching efficiency and students' learning performance."

As the evidence of their effectiveness evolves, educators and school-based therapists need tools and documentable strategies for their implementation. This research presents an evaluation protocol to guide the selection of technologies for special education needs and demonstrates its application with iPad-based learning applications for students with developmental disabilities (DD). The learning engagement of six students with DD was compared using a single-subject design when using a computer, an iPad app \"chosen\" through the protocol and a \"random\" app. A blinded reviewer observed and rated student engagement in all three learning conditions. Analysis of data indicated that three students engaged better in learning with the chosen app than with the computer and a popular random app. The engagement of five students declined when the random app was implemented. The protocol demonstrates merit in systematic selection of educational technology for students with DD."

However, there is a shortage of materials that helps teachers to include it in a transversal way in the school curriculum. Objective. The present study aimed to validate an educational technology to assist teachers to act as promoters of healthy eating in the school environment. Materials and methods. This is a methodological study of content validation and appearance of an activity book to assist teachers to include food and nutrition education across the Brazilian school curriculum. The Content Validity Index (CVI) was used and 15 judges from three specialties participated: 1) content judges (nutritionists); 2) technical judges (pedagogues); and 3) design and marketing judges. After the first evaluation, an adjustment was made in the educational technology, incorporating the expert's suggestions and, subsequently, it was evaluated by the target group: 35 elementary school I teachers. After the evaluations, the CVI, the Suitability Assessment of Materials and the Cronbach's alpha were calculated to evaluate, used to guarantee the quality and understanding of the educational material, and the reliability of the instruments. Results. The proportion of agreement of nutritionists was 0.99, of the pedagogues 1.0, of the design specialists was 84.6%, while of the target audience was 92.1%. These findings indicate that educational technology has adequate content, writing style, and appearance, in addition to good organization and motivation for reading the target group. Conclusion. The validated material is expected to be an important tool for including food and nutrition education in the school environment."

This action, implemented by the Municipal Educational Technology Center, sought to enhance the pedagogical use of existing educational technologies in these school environments, emphasizing free software, through Linux Educational, the Operational System adopted by PROINFO. The proposal consisted of ongoing training workshops throughout the year, based on the qualitative approach and methodology of action research. Educational Linux tools were selected compatible with the version available in schools and elaborated didactic materials for the development of the workshops, organized in an e-Book, aiming at the dissemination and sharing of action research in other contexts. The research analyzed the extent to which the integration of ICT, with the support of the monitor student, can help in the practice of the teachers who use the computerized environment in the school, as well as the transformations that may occur in the relationships established between monitor student and teacher that learn and teach, in a circular relationship, and in the school that hosts the proposal. The training stimulated collaborative learning, through the appropriation, improvement of skills, abilities and attitudes that resulted in changes of the student in the role of monitoring, encouraging the promotion of autonomy and voluntary action in the computer room, as an important social contribution that evidences the protagonist and citizenship behavior."

        "Information technology plays an increasingly prominent role in our personal and professional lives. It also plays an important role in schools, and especially in mathematics education. To realise their full potential in education, technologies should be designed in a way that addresses the characteristics of the target students. In the context of learning mathematics, students often experience anxiety with regard to the content that needs to be learnt; therefore, this work considers mathematics anxiety as a characteristic that should be particularly relevant when designing technologies that assist with teaching and learning mathematics. The development of personas, i.e., prototypical and simplified user descriptions, is a widely used tool in user experience (UX) research that supports design processes. In this methodological paper, we combine this UX methodology with a grounded theory approach. This combination of methodologies could facilitate the establishment of guidelines for developing personas representing secondary school mathematics students, which constitutes the goal of this paper. We review existing persona development techniques in other fields and adapt them to the context of secondary mathematics education using qualitative secondary data. Our aim is to provide a research approach that produces a better understanding of students' characteristics, needs, and fears. Despite limitations in terms of the amount of data included in developing and piloting this methodology, this work forms the basis for increasing the usability of educational technologies and for adapting them to individual learning styles to reduce mathematics anxiety."

        "Purpose Public schools in a democracy should educate young people to develop the knowledge and dispositions of citizenship in order to foster a more inclusive society and ensure the continuation of the democratic republic. Conceptualizations of citizenship must be clearly framed in order to support civic engagement, in particular, civic engagement for social justice. Rarely do educational technology scholars or educators interrogate the International Society for Technology in Education definition of digital citizenship. Educational technologists should connect notions of civic engagement and conceptions of digital citizenship. Instead, the field continues to engage in research, policy and practice which disconnects these ideas. This suggests that a gap exists between educational technologists' conceptualizations of citizenship and the larger implications of citizenship within a democracy. The paper aims to discuss this issue. Design/methodology/approach This paper uses a between-study analysis of the literature to answer: How does the field of educational technology discuss and research digital citizenship? The data were coded using constant comparative analysis. The study adopted a theoretical framework grounded in Westheimer and Kahne's (2004) What Kind of Citizen, and Krutka and Carpenter's (2016) digital approach to citizenship. Findings The findings suggest that educational technologists' uncritical usage of the term digital citizenship limits the authors' field's ability to contribute to a fundamental purpose of public schooling in a democracy - to develop citizens. Further, it hampers imagining opportunities to use educational technology to develop pedagogies of engaged citizenship for social justice. Originality/value Reframing the conception of digital citizenship as active civic engagement for social justice pushes scholarship, and its attendant implications for practice, in a proactive direction aimed at dismantling oppression."

        "The curriculum in teaching anatomy is under increasing pressure to transform from traditional to interdisciplinary integration, from cadaver-based to multimodal instruction with a system-based approach. Educational technologies are becoming critical and urged to be integrated into teaching medicine. At the College of Health Sciences, VinUniversity, the block of Human Body Structure and Function (HBSF) within the undergraduate medical training program was designed to teach anatomy with relevant basic medical sciences based on the principles of the system-based integrated structure. To support students in achieving the intended learning outcomes, multiple innovative technological platforms have been introduced into the curriculum using the moderation of the Adaptation - Standardization - Integration - Compliance (ASIC) framework over four key terms: adaptation, standardization, integration, and compliance. In this paper, the process for curriculum development is presented with an illustration of the selected technological platforms and the lessons learned using the ASIC model."

        "The relationships between content, pedagogy, and technology are important for teaching, yet complex for teachers. The idea of technological, pedagogical, and content knowledge (TPACK) has emerged in the educational technology field as a framework to explain the complexity of technology integration. In contrast to a simple view of technology, TPACK framework emphasizes the connections, interactions, affordances, and constraints of content, pedagogy, and technology. TPACK framework presents a way of thinking about effective technology integration. The preparation of teachers for effective technology integration to instruction appears to be a key component of almost every improvement plan for education and educational reform programs. This chapter provides a course design example for teacher educators about how to give pre-service teachers experience integrating technology with their instructions. The instructor designed this course to enhance mathematics teacher candidates' understanding of TPACK as a result of an intense educational technology course sequence."

        "Digital distraction has become a prominent concern in the world of education, as evident in the growing trend of banning mobile phones. Since laptops are practically indispensable to contemporary schooling, however, banning these devices remains a rare and controversial response. Far more commonplace is the deployment of classroom rules and policies outlining appropriate uses of information and communication technology (ICT). By way of an empirical example, this article provides two contrasting theoretical analyses of such ICT rules: a critical story inspired by neo-Marxism and a posthumanist story inspired by actor-network theory. In the critical story, teachers use ICT rules to tame unruly students and make them compliant workers. In the posthumanist story, however, students and teachers jointly use ICT rules to tame unruly laptops and domesticate these entities. The article tells these two stories, unpacks their basic assumptions and discusses their implications for the field of educational technology."

To retain more students in the field, teachers can use various educational technologies to explain difficult concepts. One of these educational technologies is remote robotic experimentation. The correlational study described in this paper utilizes the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology acceptance model to examine if performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, and facilitating conditions can predict the intention of high school computer science teachers in Cyprus to use remote robotic experiments in their classes. Surveys, based on the UTAUT survey instrument, were collected from 90 high school computer science teachers in Cyprus, and a multiple regression analysis was applied to measure the correlations between the constructs and finally the model fit of the analysis. The results of the study show that if certain conditions are provided to the teachers then there is a higher probability that they will use remote robotic experimentation in their classes."

A primary school teacher and her students participated in a series of classroom-based computer-mediated collaborative learning sessions. Students worked in groups and solved a number of mathematical problems with the use of a limited number of available computers in the computer lab of their school. The participants reflected upon their experiences in interviews that were conducted before and after these sessions. In addition, a reflective journal was used to reflect on the process. The thematic analysis of participants' reflections upon their experiences and the reflective journal unveiled several strengths such as that teacher custom-made learning environments, combined with collaboration in groups, can be a possible solution for technology-rich learning experiences for children in inclusive settings. Also, some benefits of collaboration in groups with the use of the computer occurred, such as working in small groups, increased acceptance, group balance and increased participation. However, some weaknesses of using educational technology in environments with limited available technological resources arose from the analysis. These were technical issues and challenges of collaboration in groups with the use of the computer."

Data was collected from the senior school teachers of Indonesia using a cross-sectional field survey. The final dataset of 163 respondents was then analyzed using SmartPls3 to test the measurement and structural models. Results revealed that the external variables like facilitation learning environment and learning through experimentation were positively associated with the perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and actual use of the educational technology among the senior school teachers. This study provided insights that the technology supportive learning through experimentation gives a feeling of comfort and ease to teachers, further leading towards the actual usage of modern technology in classroom settings."

        "Teacher education often under-theorizes race. The field of teacher education and technology integration is also complicit in assuming a race-neutral space into which technologies are integrated. This paper explores what pre-service teachers' (PSTs) technology integration reveals about racialized assumptions. The research applies theoretical frameworks from teacher preparation, Whiteness and Critical Race studies, and technology integration. This study points toward a relationship between PST development, beliefs about technology, and an intersection with race awareness. The PSTs made assumptions about learning deficits, appropriate behaviors, and classroom environment, based on Whiteness, which impacted how they integrated technology. These findings complexify current educational technology narratives of technology integration which emphasize the relationship between teacher beliefs about knowledge acquisition and technology integration, but often divorce those beliefs from assumptions about race. Implications for practice include the need to confront white supremacy concealed within the technologies and pedagogies that teacher educators choose in the classroom."

        "In recent years, there has been an increase in the popularity of personalized learning (PL) and educational technology in American K-12 schools. In particular, school models that use technology to deliver personalized learning experiences for students have proliferated. Still, few studies have investigated these phenomena in K-12 contexts, with no studies to date examining the implementation and evolution of PL models over time. Toward closing this gap in the current literature on PL models, this qualitative case study uses Activity Theory to understand how and why a PL school in the United States evolved from its inaugural year through its third year of implementation. Findings indicate that the school exhibited substantive changes in organizational practice rooted in: (1) a disconnect between vision and practice; (2) the implementation of a \"No Excuses\" model and the school-level prioritization of accountability; and (3) the reprioritization of PL. Implications for educators and organizations interested in developing and implementing PL are discussed."

Preferential development of technical creativity of students in robotics is pointed out in additional education system. The practice of introducing robotics into the academic process is still at the initial stage of its development and is not always efficient. In this study, educational robotics is considered as an element of polytechnic orientation of the academic process. The possibility of its use as a special educational technology in classes on subjects of science and math cycle is substantiated. Three areas of professional work of the teacher are distinguished in the structure of the technology: robotics as an object of study, as a tool of cognition and as a means of teaching, development and upbringing of students. The paper reveals the activity of the teacher in each direction. The results of teaching experience of the authors related to the application of this technology in teaching physics are presented.

        "Information technology has been significantly developed during the past decades. Teachers leverage various technologies to enhance teaching experience and knowledge delivery. Students explore diverse knowledge from numerous learning resources on the Web. Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic accelerates processing technology integration in education. During the pandemic, Zoom and Google Classroom were widely used for course content delivery, and they are still presenting their values in the post-pandemic era. Some other applications are also continuously adopted when in-person teaching and learning have been resumed. In this paper, a literature review-based approach is applied to summarize recent achievements in educational technology and present several promising directions for the future of education, including artificial intelligence-powered content generation and metaverse. A roadmap is proposed to illustrate the current and future progress of education technology. Meanwhile, safeguards are also provided to guide schools and parents to be aware of the potential hazards during technology use at the K-12 education level."

        "The article aims to describe gamification and educational technologies integrated into English teacher education as impactful and novel practices in Ukraine. Therefore the study briefly reviews educational technologies and gamification research and presents empirical evidence from Kyiv National Linguistic University. Since Ukraine is determined to be in line with the world's progressive tendencies and is striving for digital humanistic pedagogy, the significance of this study lies in proving that technology-assisted gamified English learning essentially transforms Ukrainian education and positively affects Ukrainian schools where the quality of English is on the agenda. The study's central question addresses the benefits of gamified learning for building English proficiency in preservice teachers and developing necessary teacher competencies, projecting the effect on their in-service teaching at Ukrainian schools in the future. Collecting the data and carrying out the research employed mixed methods, engaging 43 future teachers of English in the 1st and 2nd years of training and 11 language instructors. The findings prove that the study is relevant and deserves further investigation for a successful application in English teacher preparation in Ukraine to make school classrooms motivating and engaging for enhancing English language education and reaching ambitious goals to meet the world's standards in teacher training."

        "This qualitative study explores the views of six Cypriot primary school teachers regarding the value of educational technology, their actual use of such technology in their classrooms and factors working against its use. Participating teachers collaborated with the researcher in the design of simple web-based learning environments for a variety of learners in their classes and the use of those in a series of computer-mediated teaching sessions, in the framework of an alternative training programme based on the Whole Teacher Development approach, a conceptual framework for in-service professional development of teachers. Both before and after this, participant observations and semi-structured interviews were conducted. It was found that the use of educational technologies in these Cypriot primary schools depends on a complex framework of interwoven and dynamic factors at both teacher and school levels. The results suggest that this collaboration opportunity has the potential to develop positive attitudes and change conservative stances towards educational technology although other factors such as lack of time, a demanding curriculum and limited ready-made and suitable educational software work against its use."

        "A qualitative study done as part of the Israeli MOFET research network on pedagogical innovation is presented. One hundred and ten faculty members from eight colleges of education responded during 2012 to an open-ended questionnaire designed to bring about those teacher educators' stories about pedagogical innovation, as these emerge from their professional experiences in the field. Early in the inductive analysis of the stories we found out that the participants in our study tended to include practical examples of using educational technologies, even when the questionnaire didn't mention technology at all. This tendency constituted the first finding. Two additional results emerged from further analytic steps: faculty members in Israeli colleges of education indeed connect between \"pedagogical innovation\" and educational technologies; however the mentioned technologies were not the most innovative ones (by the time the study took place). Thus, the stories we analyzed reflected a gap that might exist between pedagogical innovation and technological innovation within the participants' conceptual framework. Also, we found out that the teacher educators' discourse usually related \"pedagogical innovation\" to educational technology using general terms like \"distance learning\" and \"course website\", and less by referring to specific learning technologies. The presentation will discuss these findings and their implications to the changing field of teacher education and to the cultural change the colleges of education have been witnessing."

        "This paper explored informal (after-school) and formal (elective course in-school) learning contexts as contributors to middle-school student attitudinal changes in a guided discovery-based and blended e-learning program in which students designed web games and used social media and information resources for a full school year. Formality of the program context did not substantially influence attitude changes but did appear to influence learning outcomes. While intrinsic motivation did not change in the aggregate from pre- to post-program among students, positive changes in intrinsic motivation were found to be associated with engagement in almost all areas of student engagement in Globaloria, with several at-home engagement changes measured. This finding challenges critiques of discovery-based learning as being de-motivating. Lower parent education among students was associated with positive changes in self-efficacy for online research indicating that disadvantaged students may stand to benefit from programs like this one. The study offers support for the need to more definitively explicate instructional design and context factors in educational technology research when investigating influences upon learning outcomes. The study holds implications for designing effective digital literacy interventions, and contributes to theory in the learning sciences and socio-technical systems research."

        "Disparities in the technology practices, skills and knowledge of school students still exist, despite widespread investment, and use in schools. In order to understand why inequalities remain, we first need a more nuanced understanding of students' technology practice, including understanding how their backgrounds, circumstances and experiences shape their perceptions of and engagement with technology. This paper proposes that research in the field of educational technology would benefit from a sociological framing in order to highlight how and why students use technology at school and in their everyday lives. The paper reports on a qualitative embedded case study of 13-16-year-old students in two Australian secondary schools. In-depth case studies of two selected students illustrate the complex nature of students' technology practice. Bourdieu's concepts of field, habitus and capital are used as a lens through which to view and understand inequalities in students' technology practice. The findings demonstrate the utility of sociological theory in educational technology research by highlighting systems and structures of reproduction and transformation. Furthermore, the findings can inform an approach to teaching and learning that considers students' varied experiences, knowledge, perspectives and backgrounds relating to technology."

Based on these, four currently relevant themes or topics are addressed and analyzed, such as a) Covid 19 and the closure of schools: the unexpected impulse of digital instruction; b) The pedagogical and organizational integration of ICT in schools; c) The metamorphosis of didactic materials. The analysis is made from analog to digital resources; and d) digital teaching competence. Between micro-skills taxonomies and holistic approaches. The article ends by concluding that there has not yet been a digital disruption of the school institution, but that progress is being made in that direction. It must not only innovate teaching methods and strategies, but also the meaning, goals, academic organization, professional functions of teachers, and ultimately, the functionality of the school in the context of the digital society."

        "Even as the effectiveness of Virtual Reality (VR) in education begins to be understood in the US and western Europe, the potential for this technology to lead to knowledge rediscovery and lifelong learning in Sub-Saharan Africa remains unexploited. This region has unique educational-delivery problems that position VR as a premier instrument that may respond to learners' needs. Factors hindering education in Sub-Sahara Africa include the high expenses for students attending brick-and-mortar schools; the long distances learners must travel to access these schools; the lack of learning materials like books and writing instruments; and few educational technology professionals. This present research reviewed published research articles on how VR, as an educational tool, can be used to address these problems and lead to knowledge rediscovery and lifelong learning in Africa. The review suggested that, at this time, VR can only be used as a supplementary teaching aid to assist learner understanding."

        "The construction industry is greatly influenced by the design technologies available. In the last decades, drafting machines have been replaced by personal computer with CAD (Computer Aided Design) software changing the way to face the drawing phase in design offices and construction schools. Therefore, apart from the economic problems in buying hardware and software, the introduction of CAD in the school environment has not been so difficult. However, nowadays the AEC (Architecture, Engineering and Construction) industry is moving towards the use of BIM (Building Information Modeling) methodology. In this case the change is harder because learning another software is not enough, but it is necessary to modify the design methodology according to the BIM system. Therefore, the present paper wants to analyse the state of the art of the experiences at international level about BIM learning, in order to clarify if BIM can be considered a new educational technology in AEC education."

In Mexico in mathematics area, the schools have not had a sufficient performance, so the interest of this research, is to give a tool to the students of basic level of secondary, to improve in this area. This article describes the results of two exploratory studies carried out during a school year 2016/2017 among students of the mathematics course of the Federal Secondary School No. 2 \"Julio Zarate\" from the city of Xalapa de Enriquez, Veracruz, Mexico. The studies aim was to find out which pairs of students in a collaborative activity obtained higher learning gains by using an intelligent tutoring system. The methodology consisted in working on students to the first and second year of secondary school, to which they were applied a battery of instruments like pre and post-test to measure the initial and final knowledge, the collaboration test and learning styles test, used as instruments of data collection. Getting results that show that students with the same learning style who work in pairs get significantly higher learning gains (higher score in their pre-test to post-test) than those who work different learning styles, it is concluded that to form teams in pairs for a collaborative activity, students must coincide with the same learning style."

Educational technology in question creates conditions aimed at increasing teaching/learning quality, making graduates more competitive in the labor market. Professionally significant qualities such as responsibility, critical thinking and flexibility are in the limelight of the proposed technology. The article describes a launching stage, specifics of teaching/learning materials, organization and monitoring of students' activities. Evidence-based research was conducted with eighty higher school students majoring in psychology and foreign languages. Research methodology included analysis of historical data along with analytical and psychodiagnostic approaches. The results show that psychological climate in students groups involved in this pilot experiment improved as compared to baseline data. The experimental pilot study, which was aimed at creating educational settings favorable for developing soft skills and professional competencies, proved that open group/ pair-based approach is versatile and can be applied in any field, as well as at any level of education, as students absorb and process didactic material relying on their own individual resources and powers). Study process shows much higher efficacy as compared to traditional frontal educational setting."

        "In the context of imposing the incorporation of digital technologies in schools, the pedagogical thinking of teachers still has disassociated from the application of educational technology. The purpose of this work is to analyse and understand how an apparently beneficial proposal, such as the use of educational technology in schools, has such a negative predicament among so many teachers. This is particularly evident in initial teacher training. From a narrative approach to the student experience, it is about identifying the kind of story that has been accompanied and popularly assigned to technology in schools, which prevents the implementation of an alternative narrative of the possibilities of a school with technology. The qualitative narrative research is launched by applying the focus group technique to educational activity, with groups of future education professionals, future teachers, and future educational technologists. Their imaginary of technology is recovered in the type of commercial film that makes them evoke the concept. Three techniques of this nature were performed in as many class groups during courses 18-19 and 19-20, with 73 students, both genres, from a Spanish university. In the analysis, four popular stories about educational technology are collected: humanist. machinist, scientist, and futurist. In the light of these stories that are embodied in various school imaginary, based on the tradition of the school itself and the university, a new humanist narrative that combines scientific and futuristic aspects is revealed, which could help rethink the possibilities of technologies within alternative education."

This creates pressure on instructors, pedagogies, educational technologies to primarily cater to these digital natives. This paper conducts a descriptive study of students of rural AP to see if indeed Indian tier 2-3 students are of this caliber and description. Should the digital natives model be used for rural Indian student profile as well? Findings from our survey based study reveal that of the (N=372) tier 2,3 students only 50% own a PC, only 41% surf the web; and of those who surf, it is mostly consumption behavior with social intent. And finally, while the confidence in learning and skills is high, English comprehension skills is poor. We feel that this profile of students is in contrast to the computer savvy image being projected, and should inform emerging educational technology projects aimed for rural India."

To this end, we retrieved 2665 articles that contained 75674 valid references from the Scopus database for the period between 2001-2021. Several structural and temporal metrics were used to find out the emerging topics proposed by the literature of immersive technology in the field of education. Results recorded 869 clusters entailing 2561 nodes and 3372 links. The major clusters identified in our results were related to virtual reality, augmented reality, and virtual worlds. We found that immersion research was grounded on a robust theoretical framework such as constructivism, experiential learning, and cognitive load theory. We found diversified venues of publication in which the immersion literature appeared in 741 peer-reviewed journals. Our results indicate that seven educational technology journals were the most highly co-cited journals where Computers and Education and British Journal of Educational Technology were the most influential journals in terms of quantity and quality of the published articles, recording the highest h-index. Tips and suggestions for future research projects were also highlighted."

Complexity theory, transdisciplinarity and ecoeducation are addressed as the guiding principles of Creative Schools. Based on qualitative and exploratory research, the study analyzes scientific publications on the proposed topic. The reviewed publications show that technologies are necessary and urgent in the inclusive process and are pollinators of creative and ecoeducational projects. In this vein, the pursue of a school that, through research, can overcome its weaknesses and envision paths to a new paradigm, supported by creativity and seeking to educate citizens to become critically conscious, invites us to think about the concept of \"science with consciousness\"."

The current paper presents a framework to support design thinking in relation to CI educational technologies. Our framework is grounded in an organismic-contextualist developmental perspective that orients enquiry to the design of increasingly complex and integrated CI systems that support coordinated group problem solving behaviour. We focus on pedagogies and infrastructure and we argue that project-based learning provides a sound basis for CI education, allowing for different forms of CI behaviour to be integrated, including swarm behaviour, stigmergy, and collaborative behaviour. We highlight CI technologies already being used in educational environments while also pointing to opportunities and needs for further creative designs to support the development of CI capabilities across the lifespan. We argue that CI education grounded in dialogue and the application of CI methods across a range of project-based learning challenges can provide a common bridge for diverse transitions into public and private sector jobs and a shared learning experience that supports cooperative public-private partnerships, which can further reinforce advanced human capabilities in system design."

In this new scenario, the Chair of Educational Technology in the School of Humanities and Education of the Universidad Nacional de La Plata adjusted its approach to these new conditions mainly by using a virtual classroom and a videoconference system. In this article we analyze the tensions we have been experiencing during this year because of these new teaching conditions. These tensions have become opportunities since we were able to capitalize on our prior experience of working together: the reaffirmation of the teaching model centered on the student, the visibility of all pedagogical interventions, an increase in educational experiences using digital technologies, the irreducible tension between agents and tools (as expressed by Vigotsky), among others. First, we start this document with the description of the Educational Technology Chair, then we present the principal aspects of our teaching model in order for the readers to be able to identify the tensions and challenges in this situation. Last, we offer some preliminary ideas on the objectives achieved in the course during the first part of this year."

The article sheds light on the OECD as an arena for the pooling and channelling of ideas relating to the uses of school computers. It, therefore, not only fills a gap in the history of educational technology, but also demonstrates how knowledge was catalysed and disseminated by this international governmental organisation.

        "During the coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) outbreak, many education systems were forced to shut down and move learning and instruction online. The future of learning is here before we know it. While the combination of distance learning and educational technology presents a timely solution combating adverse consequences of school disruptions, there is a real risk of channeling learning opportunities through already-existing forms of digital disparity, especially for marginalized populations. China, as one of the first education systems to experience system-wide school closures due to COVID-19, faces critical challenges of digital divide. To examine pandemic ramifications and effective policy strategies taken to mitigate its unintended consequences, this study leverages an original student learning experience survey collected during the pandemic, and documents national and provincial-level COVID-19 education policy responses in China since the initial outbreak. The study uncovers saliency of access to distance learning and educational technology in shaping student learning experiences, and identifies three compelling policy takeaways from the \"Disrupted Classes, Undisrupted Learning\" initiative, and discuss emerging lessons drawn for crafting an undivided future for remote distance learning."

        "When educators provide students with opportunities to interact with educational technology such as floor-robots, it may: (a) increase students' awareness of new educational tools, and (b) enhance students' use and engagement with new technologies. This case study provided upper-elementary, Hispanic students with opportunities to engage in structured and unstructured activities with floor-robots, with direct support from researchers and the cooperating teacher. These educational robots were introduced to student-participants on multiple occasions during regular instructional class time in a Title I school on the U.S.-Mexico border to determine: (a) students' interest in continued use of floor-robots; and (b) students' perceptions of ease-of-use of floor-robots. Floor-robots were selected largely because researchers had access to two types: a Roamer floor-robot and a Thymio floor-robot. For students from underserved populations, it is important that educators strengthen students' self-efficacy in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) areas (Mau & Li, 2018), as well as increase students' awareness and use of newer educational technologies, which is a growing field and includes floor-robots. However, in-service teachers may need guidance, support, and professional development when selecting and using new educational technologies such as floor-robots. Student-participants' post-study surveys and interviews provided researchers with insight into elementary students': (a) interest in floor-robots and robotics, (b) perceived ease-of-use, (c) preferred type of floor-robot in this particular study, and, (d) opinions on the potential uses and downsides of floor-robots."

        "Elementary, middle, and high school students need opportunities to engage with educational technology. This is particularly essential for those students who may not have access to new technologies at home and/or school. The socioeconomic status continues to increase the digital divide and equity in education in terms of access to technology; and as new and advanced technology becomes more available for some, others are falling further behind. A key component in ensuring all K-12 students receive opportunities to engage with technology is to prepare preservice teachers to be proficient at using new educational technologies in their classrooms. Virtual Reality (VR) environments are gaining traction across some environments. However, in the United States, some states limit or exclude VR from elementary and middle grades. In a recent service-learning project, 14 preservice teachers were introduced to two types of floor-robots and one style of a VR headset. Most preservice teachers had not used any of the technology prior to the required course. After learning how to manipulate floor-robots and navigate virtual environments, they taught middle and high school students with exceptionalities how to use technology to enhance comprehension of mathematics and social studies content. Of the 14 preservice teachers in the course, seven agreed to allow their surveys and reflections to be used for data collection and analysis. Results demonstrate that preservice teachers view technology for use in school settings favorably, and they believed that middle and high school students with exceptionalities benefitted from the educational technology instructional experiences. However, there were some concerns about costs."

Since the pedagogical process can be benefited by the use of artifacts to demonstrate concepts, a research was developed to identify which technologies are or may be appropriate for use in the teaching-learning process in the Brazilian Basic Education. This paper presents the results of the research from the perspective of teachers of this phase of education. From these results, it is possible to guide future work related to the development of pedagogical proposals mediated by these technologies, mainly related to the use of demonstration artifacts."

In Participatory Action Research (PAR), teachers, students, or other members of the educational community participate as co-researchers who collaborate with researchers to build understanding and solve problems that are relevant to the school or community. This article describes the purpose, background, characteristics, and potential applications of PAR methods. It employs a meta-synthesis approach to investigate five adult-youth PAR collaborations that implement educational technology to meet needs in diverse educational and community settings. The main questions asked are:How can PAR advance educational technology research?In educational technology research, how can adult and youth collaborations in PAR benefit learning and the community?Results show that PAR collaborations not only provide opportunities to gather and assess information, but can also increase dialogue that leads to meaningful understanding, insightful action, and positive change in the community and digital environments. Findings suggest that, in educational technology research that is focused on improving learning or addressing a community need, combining technology with adult/youth collaborative research relationships can increase insights and understanding while moving community members to actively address the issue."

The methodology is a unique case study, a subject of initial teacher training from three successive academic courses. A portion of the portfolio to class in the community that has been generated in a wiki are analyzed. It includes other ethnographic techniques.

        "There is a tendency to think of the impact of educational technology in a vacuum. However, it is likely that the instructional context in which educational technology is used affects student learning. For instance, outcomes may differ when using educational technology in a classroom versus at home, in a quiet versus noisy environment, or in a context where support is readily available versus not available. The COVID-19 pandemic provided an unexpected opportunity to explore this issue. Intending to explore how providing hints and feedback within a digital learning game (Decimal Point) impacts mathematics learning, we instead found ourselves exploring a new question: How did learning with the game differ between classrooms and at home? After two of five middle schools had participated in our classroom experiment, we switched to at-home use of the Internet-based game for the final three schools due to the pandemic. The different instructional settings led to significantly different completion rates, likely due to students in the classroom (N = 151) being monitored by experimenters and teachers (completion rate of 88.8%), while students at home (N = 126) were not monitored nor strictly required to finish (completion rate of 56.5%). In addition, the two versions of the game, one that provided students with onrequest hints and error feedback (Hint condition) and one that did not (No-Hint condition), led to different classroom versus at-home results. On the delayed posttest, students in the No-Hint condition did significantly better in the classroom, while there was no significant difference between conditions at home. In addition, students in the Hint condition used significantly more hints in the classroom than they did at home. There was also a significant effect of gender in the classroom, with female students out-performing male students on the immediate posttest, but with no effect of gender remotely. We performed post-hoc analyses to better understand students' learning processes and gameplay behaviors. In summary, our study clearly illustrates how educational technology can be sensitive to instructional context, yet just cracks open the door to much more research on this topic."

        "This study investigates how pedagogical, cultural and institutional factors interact with technical knowledge in educational technology integration and how they relate to equitable and effective technology use in low-resource settings. In the context of a one-to-one tablet initiative in rural Kenya, we explore how these factors constrain or support access to technology, instructor's capacity, student's engagement and student's learning, as well as their implications for reducing educational and digital divides. We employ mixed methods, such as a quasi-experimental (prepost, nonequivalent control group) research design that draws the data from classroom observations, teacher's interviews, student's surveys and focus groups and assessments of student's academic performance to generate evidence on classroom practices and student's learning in schools with access to tablets, while also highlighting core challenges to successful technology integration. Our findings contribute to the identification of prerequisites and supporting factors for the successful educational technology integration, as well as policy levers and school-based strategies that are likely to increase equitable access to quality learning experiences in schools in low-resource contexts. Practitioner Notes What is already known about this topic A lack of funding, planning and infrastructure hinder information and communication technology (ICT) integration. Procurement of educational technology and infrastructure improvement efforts have reduced digital divides, but learning divides persist in implementation. Insufficient teacher technology expertise and professional development constrain teacher's effective use of educational technology in classrooms. What this paper adds We employ mixed methods-triangulating the student's assessment data with data from student's surveys and focus groups, teacher's interviews and classroom observations-to identify how pedagogical, cultural and institutional factors interact with technical knowledge in ICT integration in ways that support or constrain student's learning in low-resource contexts. We find that more attention is needed for cultural factors that interact with pedagogical and technical skills to ensure that the classroom instructors' attention is equitability distributed in ways that discourage in-class \"tracking\" and differential access to quality learning experiences, such as some teachers' disregard of \"slow learners\" in the classroom. In low-resource contexts, providing even basic levels of infrastructure (eg, a consistent power source) and access to general technical knowledge requires more creative and concerted efforts from school leadership and instructors, such as the offer of tutorials and reading clubs outside of the class to expand the access and improve the use of devices. Implications for practice and/or policy We find that device sharing can have positive effects on peer-to-peer learning, which suggests that policymakers in Kenya should weigh the benefits of achieving one-to-one device access against the potential advantages of alternative investments, such as expanding professional development on the integration and use of currently available devices. Increasing opportunities for peer-to-peer learning and exchange (among teachers and students) and building shared capacities for ICT integration can help reduce technical issues and lost instructional time."

The process of media education is presented as an integral system in the context of representation of meaningful constructs. The results of the study allow us to state that in the era of digital transformation, media educational technologies are able to act as an effective tool in the professional activities of a teacher of a general education or higher educational institution. This fact is due to a combination of conditions, among which we have identified the following: intensive development of digital technologies; increasing media exposure to the younger generation; expansion of the area of implementation of media education technologies. As our practical experience has shown, the use of the above technologies of media education in the process of analyzing media texts in a school, student audience will allow not only to comprehensively study media works, but to form one's own point of view about it, develop analytical skills and critical autonomy of the individual, which will help increase the level of media literacy. The authors provide a set of effective media education technologies that are integrated in the education of schoolchildren/students; the results of this integration are presented."

Quantitative research methods, namely he survey and correlational (prediction) research designs, were used in the study. The participants of the research are constituted of teachers (n=419) who served at secondary (n=10) and high schools (n=6) in the nearby districts of Diyarbakir, in the spring semester of 20142015 academic year. While no significant differences were found in the ETSSE and all sub-dimension mean scores with regard to level of school teachers serve in, teaching experience and their degree of learning, the scores of ETSSE significantly differentiated in terms of teachers' gender and branches. According to the regression analysis, the attitudes towards using technology in education and level of developing materials for lessons had the most important relation in explaining ETSSE scores (R=.47; Adjusted R-2 =. 22; p=.00). When the views of the teachers are investigated with regard to their ICT usage: in planning and preparation for the course, in designing the course content, in the course of instruction, measurement and evaluation process; ETSSE scores were differentiated in support of the teachers who used ICT in all the process of the lessons than the others who used ICT in one or two different processes."

So under the guidance of teaching theory, mathematics micro-teaching can improve the application of scientific methodology, modern educational technology, micro-economic theory and mathematics classroom activities method. It can practice teaching behavior as teaching strategies level were summarized, also can forming a controlled operable teaching strategies system and scientific training program. Micro-teaching has strong practical research on teaching strategies of training to fill the gaps in macro-teaching theory and mathematics teaching theory research.

To this end, it appropriates bibliographic research, based on the approach of the policy cycle and the theory of the performance of Stephen Ball and collaborators, when they present educational policies in processes of construction and meaning in different cycles. It is understood that the trajectory of the PROINFO educational policy is marked, above all, by the multiple demands, discourses, meanings, interpretations and actions observed from the context of influence, going through the context of text production and the context of school practice. In these contexts, PROINFO is identified as part of a social agenda, in which different groups of power compete for spaces to legitimize their ideas on the fundamentals of this proposal, which is not simply implemented in public schools."

As more and more products become available, school districts face the challenge of identifying and evaluating programs to meet students' needs, while ed-tech providers compete for access to decision makers. The present mixed methods study sought to document the process by which school districts discover, evaluate, and acquire ed-tech products and how vendors market and work through this process with districts. Participants included district stakeholders representing 54 school districts and vendors from 47 ed-tech companies. Results indicated that, in contrast to best practices, needs assessments were rarely, if at all conducted, districts and vendors lack a central source of information for product information and evidence of effectiveness, and decisions are often made on small-scale pilot tryouts, peer references, and less often by examining rigorous evaluation evidence. Based on these findings, we offer recommendations for both district and vendor stakeholders to encourage successful procurement of ed-tech products."

This interest has coincided with the growing marketization of systems of public schooling, especially in the United States, as well as the increased use of educational technologies (or EdTech). This study examines the implications of the growing use of profit-driven educational technologies for the politics and spatial practices of schooling. Specifically, it examines past experiences with market-oriented EdTech systems in Oregon and Michigan to highlight how the combination of market systems of governance and profit-driven EdTech practices depend on the deconstruction of links between schools, communities, and students in order to roll out aspatial and apolitical educational practices that maximize profits. The placeless vision for education embedded in profit-driven EdTech helps promote the reproduction of dominant orders and stifles place-based struggles over educational justice."

This article proposes that research in the field of educational technology would benefit from a sociological framing that pays attention to the understandings and lives of learners. Within a broader study that aimed to investigate students' use and value of technologies guided by Bourdieu's sociological theory, this article reports on qualitative embedded case study data of 12 students in years 9 and 10 from two Australian secondary schools. The article provides detailed accounts of students' experiences with technologies in various contexts with consideration of the milieu in which technology use occurred, illustrating the heterogeneous and complex network of influencing factors on students' technology practices. The findings and discussion augment the application of Bourdieu's concepts of field, habitus and capital as a tool to view and understand students' varied and complex experiences and relationships with technology."

        "Reflecting on 50 years of educational technology research, a content and authorship analysis was conducted of 1777 research article titles and abstracts, published in the British Journal of Educational Technology (BJET) from 1970 to Issue 3, 2018. A text-mining tool (Leximancer) was used to identify key concepts and themes emerging throughout each of the five decades, which were then compared to those found in a previous analysis of Computers & Education, as well as the most cited BJET publications in each decade. The framework of West and Rich (2012) was then used to provide guidance on BJET's rigour, impact and prestige. Common themes in BJET throughout the past 50 years have included the evolution of teaching and learning in distance education, the emergence of instructional design, misunderstanding between practitioners and learning designers, issues of pre and in-service teacher education and technology uptake by educators and students, including the confidence to do so, the technology skills of educators and students, as well as a lack of institutional support to provide space and time for training and integration to occur. The authorship analysis revealed an encouraging increase in international identity over time, with 60% of articles in BJET published by an author outside of the UK over the past 50 years, and 79% in the past decade. Despite this, contributions from South America, the Middle East and Africa are vastly underrepresented, and authors from these regions need further support from the field. Suggested future research areas include finding alternative models of educator professional development, further exploration of the role of theory and policy, as well as the rise of co-authorship and collaborative research."

Although many studies investigated the benefits of service-learning in teacher education, few were conducted in stand-alone educational technology courses. Purpose: This article reported the benefits and difficulties of a service-learning project that connected preservice teachers with authentic technology integration problems in K-12 classrooms. Methodology/Approach: Fifty-four undergraduate preservice teachers participated in this descriptive case study. They were guided to reflect on their learning related to technology integration through weekly problems/concerns survey and a final reflection survey. Semistructured interviews captured the salient aspects of preservice teachers' experiences during the service-learning project. Findings/Conclusions: Preservice teachers valued the authenticity of the service-learning project because they could (a) apply their technology integration knowledge and skills to solve real-world problems and (b) explore resources and ideas relevant to teaching content in their subject areas. Challenges faced by preservice teachers are also discussed. Implications: Service-learning can create an authentic learning experience that connects technology integration with teaching content. Project orientation and feedback for appropriate technology options are the most valuable instructor supports."

In certain countries, such as East Germany (GDR) and Sweden, this meant developing a purpose-built computer centrally to raise pupils' level of competence in informatics. As part of this process, the microcomputer became the epitome of educational technology. In this article, we investigate the process by which the microcomputer became an educational technology in the minds of the politicians and pedagogues involved in the projects. We argue that the national projects that the GDR and Sweden embarked upon express the dominant views of the respective state authorities in relation to the ideal relationship between computer technology, society, and education. Through a historical comparison by contrast of contexts, this article shows the sociotechnical imaginaries that prompted the two countries to initiate a strategy to bring computer technology into schools."

        "A key paradox of education in the 21st century is the simultaneous focus on standards, accountability, and assessments, alongside the call for schools to prepare students for the ever-changing digital world. Educational technology is often touted as the solution to all the problems that supposedly plague education. Teachers, though, often resist educational technologies for good reason, but resistance can lead to student not having opportunities to engage in 21st century literacies. The authors propose that teachers can tap into material technologies-like sticky notes, chart paper, markers, scissors, and tape-and frame those multimodal compositions as 21st century thinking. The chapter offers extensive examples of material, multimodal student compositions, and descriptions of the instructional practices that supported their creation, all from middle and high school classrooms that were under heavy pressure to teach toward success on the state standardized test. The examples are organized around the concepts of self-representation, academic literacies, and artistic expression."

According to these studies, there is a difference in behavior, attitude, learning and emotion. However, most of the studies were conducted for Mathematics and in a well developed ecological setting. In this work, we investigated the Mars and Venus Effect, by measuring together different variables, such as learning performance (in Portuguese and Mathematics), age, location area, and learning technology. The study was a random pre/posttest control group experimental design, on which 191 students from public schools in Brazil participated. The experimental group used an adaptive learning technology (called MeuTutor) for nine months, while the control group did not use any educational technology during the study. The most relevant results are: i) the use of the adaptive learning technology improves student's performance in Mathematics and Portuguese for both male and female students; ii) the improvement of male student's performance is more significant, against female students; iii) when we focus on technology, male students had better performance in mathematics, but no significant difference in Portuguese."

        "The use of educational technology and digital learning environments in secondary education can offer multiple opportunities to go beyond the traditional approach frequently used in history education. This paper provides the result of a three-week intervention in two Spanish public schools with 86 fourth-year compulsory secondary education history students. The study examined the results of the implementation of a digital learning environment about the Spanish transition to democracy, and analyzed the effects of an intervention focused on the development of historical understanding and the use of digitized historical sources in student engagement and knowledge acquisition. Data obtained through the use of questionnaires were examined quantitatively and qualitatively using a mixed methods approach and different categories. Participants reported a positive perception of the methodological approach used during the sessions and high student engagement levels were detected after the intervention, which was supplemented by improvement in knowledge acquisition after the intervention. It is concluded that the intervention allowed students to become more engaged in a traditional discipline such as history by using a disciplinary approach, and that the use of the digital learning environment was useful in promoting historical understanding about the period under examination."

Here, we report on the amount and frequency of usage of an online platform for independent practice used by 58 grade 7 math teachers from seven school districts across multiple U.S. states between August 2019 and July 2021, providing insight into instruction just prior to and during COVID-19 disruptions. Results showed an increased proportion of teachers using the platform at least twice a week over the study period, from 22.2% to 44.1%. Further, platform usage was related to teachers' level of experience and the amount of coach support received, suggesting areas for teacher support during remote instruction."

The purpose of this study was to investigate aspiring school administrators' perceived ability to meet technology standards established by ISTE Standards for Administrators (formerly known as the NETS.A) and to determine which standards they wished to pursue for future professional development. Utilizing the ISTE Standards-A as a framework, a survey was created to decipher how aspiring school administrators perceived their own abilities to become leaders with foundational technology leadership skills. The findings showed that (a) the aspiring school administrators were more likely to indicate a need for professional development in technology utilization to meet the standards than they were to indicate their perceived current competence in meeting the technology standards and effectively utilizing technology in their schools; (b) when interests were examined by race, African American aspiring school administrators were more interested in pursuing professional development to enhance their abilities to perform the tasks than were Caucasian aspiring school administrators; and (c) there was a statistically significant difference between aspiring school administrators' average Perception and Interest scores. It appeared that in general, the participants perceived a greater need for professional development in technology standards than their perceived current ability to perform the standards."

This article presents the findings of a study that explored the use of digital technology during school closures in Australia, drawing on the perspectives of primary school teachers and parents. Data were collected using Facebook groups and semi-structured interviews, and a thematic analysis conducted. The results describe seven themes associated with the teacher and parent experiences of remote learning: learning how to teach and learn remotely; learning to use technology; moving away from technology; hardware and internet access; collaboration and communication; social connection; and technology and engagement. The findings indicate the need to prioritise teachers' technological and pedagogical skills as standard practice; include parents in the development of remote learning skills; and move away from transformative rhetoric around educational technologies to a more realistic and needs-based approach."

        "In many educational jurisdictions, school systems are striving to demonstrate constant improvement. In Australia, the latest iteration of this concern is represented by the recent federal government report, Through growth to achievement. The report offers a number of recommendations to address declining achievement in Australian schooling. Pulling together scholarship on policy and educational technology I provide an analysis of key aspects of this report. This analysis draws attention to three salient features of the report: continuous assessment for continuous improvement; education as personalized learning; and growth mindset as a policy mandate. I explore the implications for schooling in Australia if these features were to be taken up. Analysis indicates that Australia could undergo significant change: teaching would be reconstituted as a process of continuous assessment; processes of personalized learning would lead to algorithmically tethered educative opportunities based upon students' previous achievement and choices; and learners would be reshaped by technologies of persuasion. Given that educational jurisdictions globally are increasingly advocating for these types of educational solutions, this research is valuable as it provides a basis for further critique of such technologies being proffered as a panacea for educational disadvantage."

        "For more than three decades, researchers, policy makers and educationalists have all harboured great expectations towards the use of technology in schools. This belief has received a hard knock after an OECD 2015-report has shown that computers do not improve learner results: Investing heavily in school computers and classroom technology does not improve learners' performance, and frequent use of computers in schools is more likely to be associated with lower results. Frequent use of computers in schools is more likely to be associated with lower results! Learners who use ICT moderately at school have better learning results than learners who use ICT very frequently (and of course better than learners who use ICT rarely). The top-performing countries in digital reading and navigation skills are very cautious about using technology in their classrooms. The demise of traditional schooling has often been predicted based on the assumption that media-related developments will explode it apart and revolutionise thinking about education. The 21st-century student has experienced the shift from the world of writing and the book to the world of images and the screen. Political expectations for the modernisation of schooling through the use of information and communication technology and the allocation of funds in accordance with politically created agendas have led to perceived pressure on school staff to employ information and communication technology as a teaching aid. Many schools are consumed by a race in which they haphazardly adopt the latest technological gadgets, but many educators do not understand how to incorporate these devices into existing instructional methods. In this study one school case is analysed. This school is a former model school in terms of ICT use, although no single trace remains of such ambitions in the school's own presentation of itself. The school was about the millennium at the forefront of ambitious ICT implementation in everyday educational life. This is no longer the case. It is therefore interesting to analyse how and why the school's ICT focus came to an end. The reason is that political expectations regarding the modernisation of schooling through the use of information and communication technology and the allocation of funds in accordance with politically created agendas are not compatible with the situational constraints and operational features within the school organisation. The promise of educational technology was anchored in the dream of increasing educator and learner productivity via learner-centred learning environments based on learner-led projects and constructivist teaching practices. The school case analysed in this study is a former model school in terms of ICT use, although no single trace remains of such ambitions in the school's own presentation of itself. The school was formerly at the forefront of ambitious ICT implementation in everyday educational life. This is no longer the case. It is therefore interesting to analyse how and why the school's ICT focus came to an end. A frustration manifested itself in a tug-of-war between the school administrators and educators. However, the school administrators changed their minds and accommodated the educators' demands. A turn-around operation ensued. One of the lessons learnt is that school administrators and policy-makers should understand the perspectives of educators before planning and implementing bold educational technology plans. The gap between the promise of educational technology and the realities shaped by the technology was induced by the educators' loss of operational control in this school studied."

Through a content analysis, the paper shows the ways in which the need for technology investment is rationalised. It also highlights how the need for educational reform drives much of the discourse in relation to K-12 education whereas, within the higher education sites, alignment with existing practices is emphasised. The analysis of the sites highlights the veiled ways in which digital futures are presented and how the corporations and their products and services are positioned. The paper highlights how educational technology advertising capitalises on new public management practices in education to a target school and university management in the promotion and marketing of educational technology - largely by-passing those working at the coalface of education."

        "Background: Innovative activity is associated with the teacher's willingness to develop and implement pedagogical innovations in the teaching and upbringing process. However, the lack of readiness of teachers to accept and practically implement innovations significantly reduces the effectiveness of innovations introduced into the educational process. The renewed practice of general education makes qualitatively new demands on teachers and educators. Pedagogical education is increasingly under the influence of forces dictating the need for its intensive development. Teachers already today must prepare for the organization of educational systems of the future, and therefore pedagogical universities face problems that they previously did not solve. Methods: The analysis of the works of scientists, educators on information educational technologies examines the problems of pedagogy in the conditions of reforming school education, positive tendencies and constraints, the role of activity in the development of information educational technologies. Study and analysis of scientific literature, materials and documents. Hence, pedagogical technology is a set of rules and corresponding pedagogical methods and methods of influencing the development, education and upbringing of a schoolboy [Pedagogy: Theories, Systems, Technology, 2010]. Findings: Modern information technologies of education are in the stage of dynamic renewal, the impulse to which was, on the one hand, the processes of reforming society as a whole, and, on the other, the logic of the development of the educational system itself. The system of general education develops in the direction of increasing its differentiation, variability, the integration of educational programs, the humanization of education. Recognition of the need for innovative transformations in pedagogical science facilitated the emergence of innovative schools in large numbers, the introduction of new technologies into the pedagogical process. What is pedagogical technology? There are many answers to this question, sometimes not matching each other. This suggests that the theory and practice of pedagogical technology is only being developed. According to S.I.Ozhegov's dictionary: \"technology is a certain set of processes in a certain industry, as well as a scientific description of the methods of production. Technology (from the Greek: \"techne\" - art, skill, skill, \"logos\" - word, teaching) - the totality of methods implemented in any process \"[Ozhegov and Shvedova, 2008]. Improvements: In recent years, a new area of knowledge has become increasingly important: innovative pedagogy or pedagogical innovation. This is the sphere of science that studies new technologies, the development processes of the school, and the new practice of education. The word: \"innovation\" comes from the Latin \"inovatis\" (\"in\" - \"novus\" - new) and in translation means \"renewal, novelty, change\" [Duisenbaev, 2015]. Thus: \"Innovative pedagogy is a branch of pedagogical science that studies the process of updating pedagogical activity, its principles, laws, methods and means (the teaching about the creation of pedagogical innovations, their evaluation and mastering by the pedagogical community, use and application in practice)\" [Education and Science. Encyclopedic Dictionary, 2008]."

        "The relevance of the problem discussed in this article is determined by the existing contradiction between the humanistic orientation of the competent educational paradigm, which determines the personal-oriented organization of the educational process of the military-technical university and the dominance of the technocratic approach, due to its closed nature of military education as well as its profile orientation of the military-technical university. On this basis, this article identifies the place and role of modern educational technologies in the development of personal and professional reflection of military-technical university adjuncts in the process of their psycho-pedagogical training as teachers-researchers. The leading method was the method of studying and summarizing the author's pedagogical experience. The article justifies the essential and phenomenological orientation of the self-development technology of the person, dialogue and interactive technologies in the process of teaching psycho-pedagogical disciplines in the educational practice of adjuncts. The essential focus, in general, is characterized by the development of personal and professional reflection of adjuncts of the military-technical university as a mechanism of their self-development, self-education, self-realization, both in the educational process, and in research, service and social activities. Phenomenological focus is reflected by specific psycho-pedagogical disciplines (\"Psychology and pedagogy of higher school\", \"Methodology and techniques of vocational-oriented teaching\") along with the implementation of dedicated technologies."

        "Purpose Educational technology (\"EdTech\") served a pivotal role in keeping schools functioning during the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Little is known about EdTech leaders' roles in shaping this response. This study explores EdTech leaders' perspectives and backgrounds, their response to the pandemic, how they envision their roles as educators, and their perspectives about how technology facilitates educational innovation.Design/Approach/Methods This study uses a qualitative, phenomenological approach to understand how 11 EdTech leaders experienced the pandemic. Participants were recruited for interviews in summer 2021 via purposive sampling to include diverse backgrounds and perspectives. Data were analyzed inductively.Findings The findings show that a four-category typology can be used to describe EdTech leaders' diverse backgrounds and experiences. Leaders emphasized equity and open collaboration in their pandemic responses, by expanding access to their tools and adapting their products as users' needs evolved. EdTech leaders anticipate streamlined user experiences, improvements in online learning, and increased adoption of artificial intelligence and simulated learning environments.Originality/Value This study addresses a gap in the research concerning EdTech leaders' perspectives on their efforts to support educators and their experiences during the pandemic. We hope this study sparks additional research on EdTech leaders' experiences and roles in education."

        "This study takes place as part of the \"Educational Podcast\" second study project, currently in progress at the Universidad Autonoma de Baja California, School of Engineering (UABC, Mexico). To start a group of five students from the Educational Technology Engineering class were invited to participate. They received Distributed Database and Educational Technology Engineering classes, with which they were able develop a Pedagogical Podcast and be part of a case study. They studied about database horizontal and vertical fragmentation as well as instructional design to combine technology and educational material in their final product, since this was the first time they developed a project like this one. The threefold objectives of the project were to promote (i) learning by doing exercises related to both classes,(ii) learning how to develop Podcasts which in turn will serve as a (iii) learning tool for their peers on future classes. To study this experience, participating students were interviewed before designing their Podcasts, and were observed during and after finishing their work. Since the five students belong to a larger group from the Distributed Database class, their class assessments (grades) on contents used in the Podcast, were compared with students' grades who did not participated in the project. All these in order to find out the impact developing the podcast, had on their course achievements. A qualitative study was performed based on students' observations and quantitative regarding grade comparisons. All these show students learned about Distributed Database fragmentation while preparing the Podcasts. This is an ongoing research so part of the results are presented. Future evaluation will take place after Podcasts are used by students from new semesters in order to find out how students' Distributed Database Podcasts has impacted on those who used them as a learning tool."

        "Background Medical education is continually evolving particularly through the modern implementation of educational technology. Enhancing interactive learning in the classroom or lecture settings is one of the growing uses of educational technology. The role and potential benefits of such technology may not be as evident in developing educational systems like the one in Iraq. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect and perception of the use of an audience response system (ARS) on interactive medical education in Iraq. A mixed quantitative and qualitative research methodology approach was used to study the effects and users' perceptions (both student and tutor) of the ARS. Method The study was conducted in an Iraqi medical school in the Head and Neck course during the spring semester for third-year medical students. The course involved fifteen one-hour lectures over fifteen weeks. Users' perceptions were evaluated by survey and focus group discussions (FGD). Descriptive statistics were used for quantitative measures and thematic analysis for the qualitative data. An ARS system was installed and integrated into the course lectures throughout the course period of three months to enhance interactive learning. Three to five interactive questions were used in each lecture. Anonymous participation and answers were maintained. The appropriate discussion was initiated when pertinent depending on students' answers. Result Most students (77% of survey, 85% of FGD) perceived the use of ARS as impactful on their learning. They found the ARS engaging (70%), motivating (76%), promoting interactions (73%), and augment learning through better understanding and remembering (81%). Through the FGD, students expressed improved focus, enhanced thinking and reflection, and joyful learning. The educator perceived the ARS use as practical, interactive, thinking-stimulator, and reflective of student's understanding. The required technology skills were reasonable; however, it demanded extra non-insignificant time to learn the use. Conclusion The perception of the ARS in this study was overall positive, providing encouragement for wide application of this technology in medical education in the developing world. Further studies are needed to validate and prioritize ARS usage in medical education in Iraq."

This paper conducted a systematic literature review of 101 educational science research articles published in Nature and Science in 1982-2021 based on the Web of Science database and analyzed the current status of research in terms of basic publication characteristics, research themes, and research processes. Five research topics were recognized, namely, education policy evaluation and reform, learning mechanisms and learning interventions, science education, educational technology, and education equity. Content of each topic had a distinctive emphasis. Findings revealed that most studies were dominated by empirical research, involving causal relationships between various educational phenomena, diverse range of research subjects, rigorous scientific randomized experiments, and quantitative analysis. We encourage more research on educational science in the future from four feasible directions, namely, developing active learning approaches to promoting effective learning, extending the research subjects and objectives of science education, conducting long-term, large-scale and practice-oriented research, and introducing new research methods into educational research."

      "AB": [
        "Today's educational system increasingly integrates digital devices such as laptops and tablets in the classroom on the assumption that the use of these technologies will increase student motivation and learning. However, research shows that students often use technologies for distractive purposes like off-task activity and multitasking. Few studies address the processes involved in this activity. This article offers a postphenomenologically informed qualitative study of students' off-task use of technology during class. Building on interviews with students in a Danish business college about their off-task technology use, findings suggest that off-task activity is not always a conscious choice. Because of deeply sedimented bodily habits, students often experience habitual distraction in the form of prereflective attraction towards certain frequently visited websites (e.g., Facebook). Laptops are experienced as endowed with an attractive allure that \"pulls you in\". Students sometimes go as far as closing the lids of their laptops to avoid this habitual distraction. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

Based upon the content analyses of these studies, such as technologies utilized, student sample, biological topics involved, the research purpose, and methodology, the following observations were revealed. Among the different types of technologies, the majority of studies utilized simulations or visualization tools. Genetics and molecular biology were the most popular biological topics. Most studies examined students' conceptual outcomes, fewer studies examined affective outcomes, and a few studies examined higher-order skills. Also a small number of studies observed students' learning processes. Beyond simply the comparison for traditional teaching versus technology-assisted learning, some studies emphasized comparing different technologies or different representations. This review also suggested some future research directions. For example, more studies should use technologies for interdisciplinary training and for fostering problem-solving skills."

        "The purpose of this paper is to explore the implications of the situative perspective in understanding technology acceptance. Briefly, this is the position that holds technology acceptance is influenced by the context of use, which determines the situations and activities in which the technology is employed. Specifically, we review the literature studying the relationship between political engagement and social media use. We examine the link between individuals' political beliefs and political engagement on their acceptance and use of social media extending the core factors of the technology acceptance model. Using a sample drawn from a pre-university college physics program, we test a structural path model, using WarpPLS, and reproduce the oft-reported link between social media use and political engagement and showing that social media use for political engagement influences individuals' perceptions of social media technology. These results are interpreted with respect to the situative perspective, specifically, we employ the ecological psychology notion of affordances to understand how social media technology is disrupting traditional political discourse and creating new forum for public discourse and political engagement. Our study demonstrates the value of considering the social dimension in understanding individuals' technology acceptance decisions and behaviors. Understanding the social dimension pf technology acceptance is necessary for modeling user technology acceptance and key to successful implementation initiatives and life cycle management of educational technologies. Practitioner Notes What is already known about this topic Using social media varies by individual characteristics and by instrumental use, creating different contexts of use, such as online political engagement. What this paper adds Using social media for political engagement influences perceptions of usefulness and ease of use. A fuller account of technology acceptance must include social and affective determinants in addition to cognitive factors. Implications for practice and/or policy Understanding technology acceptance as a social process requires an account of the purposes and functions of technology within spheres of activity. Thus, understanding the social dimension of technology acceptance appears key area of research for educational technologists working on implementation and life-cycle management of educational technologies."

This study specifically examines the barriers facing Secondary school students, providing suggestions for overcoming these barriers, as gathered from educational technology specialists. A mixed methodology was adopted, with interviews first being carried out with four parents and four students to discover details of the barriers that they face. This helped develop an online survey involving 518 respondents to identify the most frequently cited barriers. Curriculum barriers had the most impact in terms of hindering the learning process, followed by teaching, the learning environment, and social barriers. 'These four barriers were significantly greater in public-sector schools, compared to private schools. There were also statistically significant differences between male and female students. Moreover, students with access to digital devices and the Internet experienced more teaching barriers, learning environment barriers, and social barriers than those who did not. The survey results were presented to educational technology experts to suggest solutions to the problems of technology adoption. The above experts agreed on the need for a virtual learning environment (VLE) that would help develop students' self-learning, research, and critical thinking skills."

        "The purpose of this review is to learn from rigorous evaluations of alternative technology applications how features of using technology programs and characteristics of their evaluations affect reading outcomes for students in grades K-12. The review applies consistent inclusion standards to focus on studies that met high methodological standards. A total of 84 qualifying studies based on over 60,000 K-12 participants were included in the final analysis. Consistent with previous reviews of similar focus, the findings suggest that educational technology applications generally produced a positive, though small, effect (ES = +0.16) in comparison to traditional methods. There were differential impacts of various types of educational technology applications. In particular, the types of supplementary computer-assisted instruction programs that have dominated the classroom use of educational technology in the past few decades were not found to produce educationally meaningful effects in reading for K-12 students (ES = +0.11), and the higher the methodological quality of the studies, the lower the effect size. In contrast, innovative technology applications and integrated literacy interventions with the support of extensive professional development showed more promising evidence. Although many more rigorous, especially randomized, studies of newer applications are needed, what unifies the methods found in this review to have great promise is the use of technologies in close connection with teachers' efforts.

        "The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of teachers' individual characteristics and perceptions of environmental factors on the extent of technology integration into EFL (English as a Foreign Language) classrooms. To this end, a national survey examining EFL teachers' perceptions was conducted at Qatari Independent Schools. A total of 263 teachers responded to the survey, which investigated technology availability and support, teachers' value and self-efficacy beliefs, obstacles to technology integration, and formal technology preparation. The analysis of the data included descriptive statistics and multiple linear regression analysis determining the relationship among these factors. Teachers revealed consistent perceptions about obstacles to integration, high levels of confidence in using technology, and consistent beliefs about the importance of using technology as a learning tool. The extent of technology integration was predicted by technology availability, perceived importance, and formal training. The findings can assist with the technology advancement and development efforts in reform communities, similar to the Qatari context, by indicating the areas of strength and areas where additional efforts are needed. The results will lay the foundation for policymakers, teacher educators and professional development providers about current aspects and pending issues determining technology integration, thus enabling them to make better-informed decisions."

The effectiveness of educational technologies is determined through the achievements of high school students shown at the final creative test and their opinions collected from anonymous interviews in Google. docs upon the completion of the course. The profession of the journalist has received a new meaning within modern media space. On the one hand, commercialization of the profession has increased. On the other hand, new technologies are being introduced into media production. Media literacy of the audience is increasing. The youngest segment is immersed in the new digital reality. All these must be taken into account in the educational process. The essence of media education of the younger generation is to prepare them for the life in the information society. It requires the development of skills to creatively use media and interpret their content, the ability to critically analyze media products, understand the nature of the media industry, independently create their own media content. The study proves gaming techniques and the group work as the most effective. Interactive methods allow to simulate real journalistic practice, try on various professional roles. The paper outlines the structure of the training course \"Young Journalism\" as a career-oriented cycle of media education. It describes active and interactive methods of media education applied to train high school students. The final block contains the results of a survey of the course participants."

Many studies focused on users' performance after the implementation of the technology, and less attention was placed on identifying and solving the challenges and issues faced by users during the implementation of these technologies. In order to explore these issues raised and challenges faced during the implementation process of technologies in the classroom, seven professors who are experts in the field of educational technology were interviewed during conferences and events of the IEEE Technical Committee on Learning Technology during 2015-2016. Through the expert's lenses, this paper analyzes the experience shared by these experts in implementing and utilizing new innovative technologies in classrooms, including four recently prevalent innovative concepts and learning environments, i.e., collaborative learning, game-based learning, mobile learning, flipped classroom, and seamless learning. This paper further explores on the potential challenges and issues one would face when integrating new innovative technologies in a classroom from the perspective of different users' groups (i.e., learners, teachers/educators, schools/universities, developers and researchers), along with a discussion on the potential and development of two future learning environments."

Students' achievement was measured by a test covering 5 subject areas. The test was administered to 32,768 students of which 13,095 students came from schools that received the Knowledge Channel package for the 2009, 2010, and 2011 grants. The other 19,673 students were from comparison schools who had not watched the Knowledge Channel shows. Significant findings revealed that students from recipient schools (RS) have significantly higher scores than those from the comparison schools (CS). Highest effects were noted in English (in 2009 and in 2010) and in Math (in 2011). Students from RS performed better across all subjects compared to students from CS."

In this article, we demonstrate how a statistical approach, Latent Class Analysis, can help improve the quality of process evaluations and illustrate its use in an evaluation of an educational technology integration program in a large school district. In this illustration, we were interested in detecting variability in the ways teachers adopted the new program. We defined classes based on a set of innovative teaching strategies associated with educational technology. Results showed five distinct subgroups of teachers, based on level of program adoption. Results also demonstrate that specific school support strategies (professional development and personalized computing devices) facilitated program adoption. These findings can help to inform individualized support for teachers to optimize the ease and quality with which they are able to adopt new skills in the classroom."

        "This article considers the emergence of classroom wall charts as a teaching technology in Swedish elementary schools in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, using Biblical history teaching as an example. There has been some work done internationally on wall charts as an instructional technology, but few studies have looked at their use in Sweden. With a theoretical approach informed by Martin Lawn's understanding of teaching technologies, this article shows that wall charts became both an important teaching object and a means of introducing new pedagogical ideas. A study of the official school inspectors' reports shows that wall charts had spread to most local schools by the end of the nineteenth century, while an analysis of Biblical history textbooks and teaching guidelines shows that visual aids were increasingly integrated into the school curriculum. The wall charts themselves were initially imported, mainly from Germany, but by the end of the nineteenth century they were being produced in Sweden for the domestic market, in keeping with the National Romantic ideals of the day as well as with the new awareness of the importance of adapting images to use in classroom teaching."

However, in the literature, there are not many examples of studies that reveal the opinion of school teachers on this type of educational technology. In this paper, we provide the results of a survey of 82 teachers to know what they expect from the agents. The following research questions will be answered: Q1) Do you know this educational technology? Q2) If so, are teachers used to integrate this type of technology in the classroom? and, P3) If teachers could design the agent, what characteristics do they consider to be the most appropriate? How should the agent react to different situations? From the results gathered, it is expected to provide information to all researchers, designers and teachers who want to integrate this type of educational technology in their classroom."

        "With the development of society, modern educational technology and electronic information technology are more and more closely combined. Auxiliary teaching products based on computer technology, multimedia technology, and network technology emerge one after another. How to combine modern wireless communication technology with modern educational technology to evaluate the teaching effect has become one of the hot topics in the field of modern teaching research. In view of the lack of communication between teachers and students and evaluation methods of the teaching effect in traditional vocal music teaching, this paper designs a method of evaluation of vocal music teaching effect in a wireless communication environment. First, this paper designs a feedback system of vocal music teaching based on wireless communication. Second, due to the influence of vocal music teaching effect, the factors are diverse, and the neural network has the advantages in processing the data with nonlinear strong robustness and dynamic characteristics. And we use BP (back propagation) neural network as a mathematical model to receive teaching feedback information. Then, the simulation results show that the proposed method can not only evaluate the effect of vocal music teaching but also has good feasibility and practicability. Finally, the method proposed in this paper can help improve the teaching level and efficiency of the school and has a great theoretical value and practical potential."

Fine-grained MCA analysis of group interview talk reveals participant students operating as a collectivity to accomplish a sense of shared identity in relation to the iPad. This focus on the ways in which young people's identities are intertwined with digital technology distinguishes this article from the technicist and operational perspectives that dominate the field of educational technology research and demonstrates MCA's potential for illuminating the relationship that young people have with technology. The article contributes to a growing body of research that engages with more nuanced ways of understanding contemporary, technology-mediated learning as a process of producing not only knowledge and skills, but also selfhood-both private and shared."

The article discusses the features of innovative educational technology, \"Edutainment.\" The genesis of the concept of \"edutainment\" is presented. The article is devoted to the review of the educational tools of \"edutainment,\" which can be used in the educational process of university education. The works of foreign and domestic researchers, addressing the concept of technology education are analyzed and systematized. A brief chronological note is given on the emergence and establishment of \"edutainment\" abroad and in Russian didactics. The analysis and generalization of the available domestic and authentic pedagogical literature on this issue are given. The shortcomings of the existing definitions of \"edutainment\" are identified. The authors of the article understand edutainment as an exclusive educational technology, considered as a combination of modern technical and didactic teaching tools, which is based on the concept of learning through entertainment. The main difference between edutainment and the modern paradigm of learning is that the subject takes an active part in the educational process. The result of the interaction of an informatively entertaining object and an active subject in learning is knowledge, skills, individual experience, and subjective emotions. Assignments in the technology of \"edutainment\" should correspond to three pedagogical principles: the connection of theory with practice, consistency, and accessibility. The article proves that edutainment can be attributed to innovative educational technologies."

This research involved the researcher working independently on an in-class research project with 40 third-year undergraduate students. The pre-service science teachers were required to individually create an infographic related to the upper secondary school science curriculum. The findings indicated that the pre-service teachers expressed positive viewpoints about the infographics assignment. When the pre-service teachers were engaged in the learning process, they had a sense of agency and responsibility for their learning. The findings also indicated that this research created a meaningful experience for the pre-service teachers in engaging technology. This research essentially promoted innovations in teaching and learning of the course that encouraged student engagement with technology."

Now, more than ever, teachers are expected to develop 21st century skills, which creates a necessity to understand how urban teachers feel about the role of technology in their teaching practice. In addition, teacher perceptions are necessary to identify better ways to prepare students for success. Utilizing a quantitative approach, this study explored these perceptions among urban K-12 teachers. Results suggested urban teachers lag behind their counterparts related to perceived effectiveness of technology. In addition, respondents indicated technology is not utilized frequently. The results revealed personal trial and error as the most common way of new knowledge and skill acquisition. Participants reported lack of student access to Internet at home as the largest barrier to technology implementation, followed by financial cost. These findings suggest urban teachers may need more guidance and professional development on how to effectively integrate technology into the classroom. Through the development of more thorough understanding of urban teacher usage of technology, administrators may design more effective continued learning opportunities. It is recommended future investigation be conducted across multiple states to investigate technology usage by grade level and content area to best equip urban teachers to effectively implement technology in their teaching practices."

        "The article is devoted to the consideration of technological aspects of increasing the motivation of students in mastering foreign languages at school and university. Motivation in the article is seen as an inner impulse, feeling or strong desire, pushing the individual to a special action. All people have needs or motivations that are to some extent innate, and their intensity is conditioned by the environment. At the heart of the concept of motivation there are six aspirations or human needs relevant to foreign-language education. Accounting for such affective factors allows us to consider the picture of the learning process more holistically. They play a significant role in teaching, manifesting themselves in the choice of materials and tasks that motivate students to work, in finding ways to deal with mistakes that would not create anxiety; in caring for the development of students self-esteem, self-confidence and high self-esteem in class; in the aspiration of the educator to create favorable conditions and thus facilitate the process of mastering a foreign language, in increasing their autonomy, in manifesting the insight into the theory of the styles of learning. Thus, the methodological basis for such an examination of a foreign-language educational process within the framework of this article is the affective approach that involves the design of appropriate teaching technologies. The starting point of the authors' reasoning is the analysis of the concept and structure of educational technology, which was carried out in the logic of the system approach to research. As a result of this analysis, it became possible to represent the vertical and horizontal structure of educational technology. As specific ways of solving the problem of increasing motivation within the framework of this article, criteria related assessment and reflection of educational activity were chosen."

        "The aim of the paper is to introduce some educational technologies of forming writing skills while teaching foreign languages. This is of particular importance at University in the training of bachelors and masters and in the formation of their professional competencies and skills, including competencies related to the ability to present effectively projects in a foreign language in a written form. Also we develop communicative competences that are not conceivable without the ability to carry out oral and written communication in all forms in a foreign language, the ability to annotate and render professional and business texts in the language of study, compile reports, write letters, memos, etc. To respond to the challenges of modern society and adequate solutions to socio-economic, cultural, educational and professional problems we use the methods of professional linguodidactics which become a professionally oriented approach. The teaching of writing is based on the basic didactic principle from simple to complex: students develop their skills from primary to secondary texts. As a result different types of written works which students are supposed to create in higher school are introduced and the criteria for written speech are formulated."

        "This study explores educational technology infusion in the U.S. school district context. We used a complex systems perspective to understand the interactions between the classroom (micro), building (meso), and organization (macro) system levels of a school district, offering insight into how and why certain permutations of tools, content, and practices are effective and impactful. We used comparative case study methods to understand (a) patterns in teachers' implementation of digital technologies in early elementary classrooms and (b) the organizational system that influences those patterns in one small school district serving a mixed suburban/rural community. Data were collected over 12 months, and included: elementary classroom observations, interviews with principals and district leaders, and student performance data. Our findings trace activities within and connections across levels of a district organization undergoing technology infusion. We found that district administration established human-centered leadership practices to facilitate instructional technology integration and principals maintained this leadership ethos in variable ways. Teachers leveraged technology for personalization and collaborative learning, and used robust classroom management routines to anchor complex instruction with young children. The findings highlight key considerations for system leaders, technologists, and policymakers; in particular, establishing a professional culture that offers widespread support for instructional experimentation."

        "Even in the most remote U.S. rural contexts today technology is a part of schooling. This article explores stakeholders' perceptions of educational technology as it relates to schooling in six rural districts in the state of Idaho. Stakeholder descriptions were collected using sondeo style focus groups with seven specific groups (students, parents, teachers, support staff, community members, principals, boards, and superintendents) in each district (n = 42). Stakeholders believe the educational technology in their schooling environments is both necessary and welcome in their districts; however, their assessments indicated that despite a decades-long policy push aimed at increasing educational equity, augmenting schooling facilities with technology presents complex resourcing challenges. The conclusion explores how different experiences and conceptualizations of context shape individuals' understanding and implementation of educational technology. We argue that a more contextualized view of technology-oriented change is needed. One that better positions rural place as something to be protected (as opposed to overcome) in order to leverage the best of both what technology and place have to offer in changing rural communities."

        "As our society advances in technology, it is of paramount importance that the educational realm is aligned with the rest of society. In the classroom, implemented technology must be as current as possible in order to prepare our future generations for the workforce (Cuban, 2001). As women assume a greater role in the workforce, it is imperative that we prepare both male and female students for their future (Canada & Brusca, 1992). For example, training students to effectively utilize a presentation aid, such as PowerPoint, can benefit an adolescent's level of self-efficacy while speaking in front of his or her peers. Bandura (1997) pioneered the field of self-efficacy, relating several of his previously developed and researched theories. Social cognitive theory, observational learning theory, and social learning theory all contribute to the study of self-efficacy in the classroom, especially the sixth grade classroom. In the pre-adolescent stage, all of these theories can be applied to try to comprehend the actions and thoughts of sixth graders. A high level of self-efficacy in learning at this stage can prepare a student for future success in junior high and high school. Sixth grade is a pivotal time in school, as students culminate their elementary school years and anticipate junior high school. At this age, students become more involved in trends, especially technological trends. When students can utilize the same type of technology inside and outside of school, their self-efficacy may increase. Hypothetically, even within an academic setting, a sixth grader's self-efficacy will subconsciously elevate with these familiar tools. This mixed methods study evaluated the link between the use of educational technology in the sixth grade classroom and students' self-efficacy. To facilitate data collection for this study, after parental consent was obtained, students completed an online questionnaire via Survey Monkey on their classroom laptops. At a predetermined date, time, and location, teachers of the participating students met with the researcher in focus groups. Before the meeting date and time, the focus group agenda was emailed to the teachers for their perusal. The results of the questionnaire were analyzed using SPSS, specifically examining links between questions pertaining to technology use and questions resulting in high self-efficacy. The results of the focus groups were analyzed for themes within the teachers' comments and served as essential narrative in the results and conclusion sections of the study. The results of the questionnaire and focus groups produced several implications regarding educational policy and future research. Significant, positive correlations emerged among variables within the established self-efficacy domain and the use of laptops and Smart or Interwrite boards in the classroom, iPods, iPads, and smartphones outside of class, and using educational technology in writing and math during class. No significant differences emerged between boys' and girls' self-efficacy, as corroborated by the teachers' focus group responses. Variables within the self-concept domain emerged as predictors when multiple regression analyses were run with self-efficacy dependent variables. Conclusions that were drawn from this study include the need for educational technology during math instruction, iPads for instruction during class, and further study regarding gender differences in response to technology."

        "Distance-based technologies have been one of the foci of technology-related studies since the pandemic first appeared, but there is still a need for further research to gain a greater understanding of how teachers are using these technologies in the post-pandemic era. Thus, the aim of this study is to determine whether the level of digital competence (DC) and techno-pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK) influence the acceptance, by primary school teachers, of distance-based technologies in their post-pandemic teaching. To achieve this, we integrated two external variables, DC and TPACK, into the predictors of the technology acceptance model (TAM), and introduced an extended version of the TAM. The statistics were collected through an online survey of 459 primary school teachers working in various regions of Turkiye. The analysis employed structural equation modelling. The findings suggest that there are statistically significant direct effects of digital competence and perceived usefulness on primary school teachers' intentions to use distance-based technologies. The extended model explains the connection among the variables, and the findings offer important insights for collaborators in education to better empower teachers to integrate technology favourably and to maintain distance-based technology use in the future."

Despite its importance in facing the challenges of society, QE is not offered to the population equitably and democratically, especially to the most vulnerable people and those living in remote areas. In this regard, the use of Educational Technology (EdTech) has been encouraged to improve the teaching-learning process and promote the achievement of SDG 4. This work proposes a framework containing recommendations for EdTech to contribute to the development of QE. The framework was developed from the systematization of pillars related to the main EdTech categories identified through the content analysis method. The main scientific contribution of this work is the deepening and broadening of the theory that associates EdTech with QE, providing new bases for the further development of research on the subject. This work also contributes to the development and achievement of SDG 4 through the framework with recommendations for democratizing access to education and improving students' academic performance."

        "As the successful establishment of technology supported educational systems requires wide investment in terms of finances and faculty time, this study explores the influencing factors in the adoption of Technology Enhanced Learning (TEL) and the main barriers encountered during the use of TEL in Punjab, Pakistan. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with medical educators and thematic analysis was carried out using Nvivo-10. The study participants were well aware of educational technologies and stated that the influencing factors for adoption of TEL were self-effort, motivation, a personal positive approach and departmental policy. The institutions were well equipped with resources but the main problem was the lack of faculty training and institutional support. The study concludes that pedagogy is the main driver for the use of educational technologies. At the national level, it is suggested that governing bodies can provide definite polices and guidelines for the implementation of TEL. Therefore, it is advocated that recognizing online courses can enhance potential learners' interest to enroll for e-learning programmes. At the institutional level, it is proposed to encourage the establishment of institutional policies and the organization of workshops for faculty training. At an individual level, it is stressed that there is a basic requirement to develop a technology-oriented culture partly by sharing the power and expertise among the department heads and faculty members."

        "IntroductionThe board games is an educational technology that represents an appealing, active and playful pedagogical strategy and may be capable of motivating imprisoned women to learn about Sexually Transmitted Infections.MethodsA methodological study to develop and evaluate a board game, following these stages: 1. Integrative literature review to identify educational technologies on Sexually Transmitted Infections used by imprisoned women; 2. Development of the board game; and 3. Content validation performed by 23 evaluators and semantic evaluation carried out with 10 imprisoned women who were enrolled in a school located within a female prison unit in the city of Recife, state of Pernambuco, Brazil.ResultsThe board game consisted of the following: 01 board; 01 instructions manual; 05 pawns; 52 cards; and 01 dice. A global Content Validity Index of 0.966 was reached in the content validation process performed by health and education professionals. In the validation of the board game content regarding appearance, performed by designers/developers, most of the items obtained a Content Validity Coefficient below 0.85, which resulted in the need for adjustments and a new validation round with these professionals, in which Content Validity Coefficient = 0.917 was obtained. In the semantic evaluation, all the women stated that they improved their knowledge, increased their motivation to attend the class and would like to play the board game again.ConclusionsThe \"Previna\" board game has been validated and can be considered an important pedagogical tool in the construction of knowledge in relation to the prevention, treatment and control of Sexually Transmitted Infections in the female prison context. The quality of this educational technology is directly related to its development based on an appropriate theoretical and methodological framework, in addition to satisfactory feedback from the target audience.Trial registrationNot applicable."

        "The body of academic research on technology-supported learning is growing rapidly, with much of the focus upon student learning effectiveness. This paper addresses the gap in educational technology literature on the examination of instructor characteristics. We shift the focus from student outcomes to instructor input, pedagogy and their strategy of technology selection. In particular, we explore instructors' approaches to blended learning, pedagogical aims and instructional design. Our study of management academics at two UK business schools reveals that blended learning adoption varies greatly. Based on forty semi-structured interviews with management academics, we find that this adoption depends on personal predispositions of academics towards educational technology. Personal understanding and interpretations of the blended learning phenomenon cluster into four distinct groups: traditionalist, pedagogy-centric, techno-centric and cautious, and instructional design and delivery preferences vary widely between groups. The findings of this study demonstrate that there is a wide variation in instructor approaches to blended management learning and that manifests itself markedly in the pedagogical strategies and instructional design and delivery of management education.

Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the use of technology by medical students and assess the effect of a newly developed mobile app for the study of human physiology. We used a standardised questionnaire to assess the profile of educational technology use, from which a mobile app (PhysioQuiz) was developed. The effectiveness and user opinion were assessed in a randomised controlled study (n = 110). Of 1022 students enrolled in medical school, 489 (47.9%) participated in the study. Of the respondents, 96.7% used mobile applications, with the main purpose being entertainment (94.7%) and study (81.9%). Only 6.1% reported use of physiology apps. PhysioQuiz use did not yield higher average grades (p = 0.48); however, user opinion demonstrated that it was useful for assisted learning (82.1%) and identification of non-learned content (78.6%) and considered a tool for self-assessment (89.3%). Mobile app use is widespread among medical students but there is a lack of human physiology education apps. A newly developed app for the study of human physiology was useful for assisted learning and considered a tool for self-assessment."

Ten chronic disease areas consume disproportionate percentages of healthcare resources. Adult education programs have become essential components of strategies to reduce education gaps and prepare unemployed or under-employed adults for college and career readiness. Consequently, in many countries these two populations of learners are critical to economic stability and sustained growth in technology-oriented careers. Ongoing research provided a model that combines emerging educational technologies and courseware in ways that allow customization of instructional strategies yet accommodate training in diverse content and skills. In this paper, we present the model and suggest a set of recommendations to improve educational support of adults with chronic diseases as well as to improve educational frameworks for adults preparing for college and career readiness."

Twelve grade two English teachers and their students from six schools were randomly divided in half: an experimental group (N=180) where ABRA was part of their English Language instruction and a control group (N=174) where regular instruction was used. After the pretest student data were collected, a three-day initial training and planning session were held for the experimental teachers on how to use ABRA to teach literacy. Every week each experimental class was bussed to a computer lab with full access to ABRA for one 90-min lesson. Teacher support included the alignment of ABRA lesson plans with the Kenyan English Language norms, weekly web conferences with the trainer, as well as technical and pedagogical help from staff at the lab site. After the 13-week intervention, significant and substantial gains in reading comprehension were found for ABRA students as measured by GRADE, a standardized test of literacy. In addition, ABRA students outperformed their peers in control classes on the core end-of-year subject exams including English, Mathematics, Science and Social Studies."

I argue that, historically, the Smaky was both a product of and a response to the region's economic crisis in the 1970s and early 1980s. Analytically speaking, I critically reflect on the seemingly contradictory categories of 'global' and 'local'. Although these were politically effective among historical actors, they are of limited use in the historical analysis of digital educational technologies."

Therefore, the final outcome of teacher education should be to achieve a high level of psychological-pedagogical knowledge and didactic competencies required for work in school and outside school. The course curricula and teaching content described in this paper are defined according to this guideline. The goal is to prepare students for a competitive labor market in our country and in the world, to integrate all levels of music education - from kindergarten to university, and to popularize music art. In order to determine the relationship between traditional teaching methods and lectures with the use of multimedia, research was conducted that showed that music students positively evaluated the use of multimedia in lessons. They perceive such lessons as effective, useful, understandable, interesting, dynamic, instructive and of high-quality, because they help save time and they correspond to contemporary teacher discourse."

The European Commission has included math in the Key competencies for Lifelong Learning that every EU citizen must acquire for personal fulfilment and development, employment, and active citizenship. Very often lacks math skills are due to the method used to teach math since childhood. Currently, different educational technologies have been implied to improve the learning process, making it more engaging and motivating. Serious games (SG) have been proved can be an excellent tool for acquiring and reinforcing math competencies by combining mathematical questions with game challenges. The paper presents a serious game, named Math is magic, designed specifically to address these shortcomings in primary school children. A user test was conducted to assess the effectiveness of the application, the cognitive workload, and user engagement. The data confirms that pupils improve their math skills and that the game approach was engaging and immersive."

A major challenge for anatomy teachers is to replicate the experience of practical exposures. These exposures range from cadaveric dissection to demonstration of bones, museum specimens, and histology slides, where they will have interactive communication with students, and thus help in the enhancement of communication and clinical skills among them. In recent days, anatomy teachers throughout the globe started using various advanced technology to make the teaching-learning session more interesting. In pre-pandemic era, usage of such advancements in information and communication technology was a 'choice'. But pandemic has changed the situation drastically, what was a 'choice' earlier is now an 'obligation.' Presently although infection rate is low, vaccination rate is high, most of the medical schools re-opened for usual offline teaching, still body donation is all time low making the situation 'back to square one'. Keeping such unprecedented situations in mind, we need to incorporate various innovative educational technologies in day-to-day teaching-learning methodologies."

        "This paper argues that the emphasis on orchestration as a metaphor for teaching in technology-enhanced learning (TEL) environments, featured in recent academic discussions, is an opportunity to broaden the scope of the inquiry into educational technology. Drawing on sociological literature and research that investigated the systemic factors that influence the uptake of information and communication technologies in formal and informal learning contexts, the paper contends that a focus on instructional design does insufficient justice to the complexities of actual technology use in classrooms and after-school programs. It is suggested, instead, that orchestration might better be used as a heuristic device to deepen our understandings of the relationships between power, bestowed on teachers or claimed by them through a number of strategies, educational technology, and teaching practices. The paper concludes that to fully understand this relationship and to support teachers, concern should be given equally to the existing political and cultural dynamics of TEL environments. Examples of orchestration as a political, cultural process are provided, illustrating how teachers appropriate technology and innovative' pedagogies to negotiate power."

Nevertheless, school teachers do not generally make effective use of technology in their teaching. This article describes a study designed to exhibit the interplay between two variables: the type of technology, in terms of its complexity of use, and the type of teacher, in terms of attitude towards innovation. The results from this study include: (a) elaboration of a characteristic teacher technology adoption process, based on an existing learning curve for new technology proposed for software development; and (b) presentation of exit points during the technology adoption process. This paper concludes that teachers who are early technology adopters and commit a significant portion of their time to incorporating educational technology into their teaching are more likely to adopt new technology, regardless of its complexity. However, teachers who are not early technology adopters and commit a small portion of their time to integrating educational technology are less likely to adopt new technology and are prone to abandoning the adoption at identified points in the process.

        "Connected classroom technology (CCT) is a member of a broad class of interactive assessment devices that facilitate communication between students and teachers and allow for the rapid aggregation and display of student learning data. Technology innovations such as CCT have been demonstrated to positively impact student achievement when integrated into a variety of classroom contexts. However, teachers are unlikely to implement a new instructional practice unless they perceive the practical value of the reform. Practicality consists of three constructs: congruence with teacher's values and practice; instrumentality-compatibility with the existing school structures; and cost/benefits-whether the reward is worth the effort. This study uses practicality as a framework for understanding CCT implementation in secondary classrooms. The experiences of three science teachers in their first year implementing CCT are compared with matched-pair mathematics teachers. Findings suggest that despite some differences in specific uses and purposes for CCT, the integration of CCT into regular classroom practice is quite similar in mathematics and science classrooms. These findings highlight important considerations for the implementation of educational technology."

        "The combination of digital technologies and the focus on student-centred learning, enable the integration of pedagogical methods with the effective use of technology. This integration required educators to meaningfully engage with educational technologies as it is deployed across all aspects of teaching and learning such as teaching techniques, delivery methods and learning solutions. Furthermore, mechanisms are required to establish priority for professional development for educators in order to increase efficacy of teaching and learning design. Therefore, the purpose of this interpretive case study was to identify the key considerations that educators think through in order to achieve computer integrated education design. In addition, to create a development priority and roadmap, the key considerations were mapped to the taxonomy of blended learning design. Data was collected via 13 semi-structured interviews from the case study institution, a private school operating in South Africa. Through an automated analysis process, 30 concepts and 12 themes were identified. The primary areas identified for the case study institution to attend to relate to two taxonomy areas, namely attitudes and beliefs (educator judgement relating to the use of technology by students/learners) and contextual determinants (policy, affordability, skills determinants)."

        "IntroductionBoard games can be used as a playful educational practice in the teaching and learning process, as they constitute an educational technology that can be a source of health knowledge and an aid in decision-making. The objective of this research was to assess the effect of a board game on imprisoned women's knowledge about STIs.MethodsA quasi-experimental study was conducted in 2022 with 64 imprisoned women who were students at a school located in a prison unit from the city of Recife, state of Pernambuco, Brazil. A 32-item instrument was used to assess knowledge about sexually transmitted infections before, immediately after the intervention and at 15 days. The intervention consisted in applying the Previna board game in a classroom. All the analyses were performed in the Stata software, version 16.0, with a 5% significance level.ResultsThe knowledge mean in the pre-test was 23.62 (+/- 3.23) points, whereas it rose to 27.93 (+/- 2,28) in the immediate post-test, dropping to 27.34 (+/- 2.37) (p < 0.001) in post-test 2, which was performed 15 days after the intervention. There was a statistically significant difference in the means obtained between the pre-test and the immediate post-test (p < 0.001), with a difference of 4.241 points, as well as between the pre-test and post-test 2 (p < 0.001), a difference of 3.846 spots.ConclusionsThe Previna board game significantly increased its players' knowledge about STIs, and such increase in knowledge remained significant during the follow-up period."

The project was included in the Finnish government programme and National Information Society Policy of Finland. The aim of the project was to create a national educational technology plan and the vision was that Finnish schools would have practical models and innovative teaching practices for using ICT in all Finnish schools. The project aimed to produce new knowledge and know-how for schools and educational administrators about the latest developments in ICTs, but more importantly to develop the educational use of ICT in multi-dimensional ways. A new Finnish core curriculum reform process for basic education started in 2012 and the final documents were published at the end of 2014. The new curriculum emphasizes 21st century skills, like critical and creative thinking skills and collaborative modes of studying. ICT is seen having an important role in supporting and developing these skills. It is useful tool, which also can expand learning environments and diversify methods of working. This chapter presents some of the background knowledge and strategic guidelines contained in the National Educational Technology Plan and Finnish National Core Curriculum and discusses their implications in schools' everyday lives."

        "The relevance of this research is based on the standpoint of the epistemological methodology focusing on the quality of the profession cognition. Therefore, it is presumed that the quality of vocational education is determined by the variable personality traits of teachers (extraversion, openness towards experience and innovation, consciousness, agreeableness, neuroticism). The research object of the current study is the correlation between the personality traits of university of applied sciences teachers and vocational teachers and the curriculum components. The research aims at identifying the correlation between the motives of vocational school and university of applied sciences teacher activities, educational technologies they use, professional roles and their personality traits, as well as identifying the essential differences of the mentioned variables. The quantitative and qualitative research strategies were employed allowing the researchers to perceive and assess the parameters of the correlation between the professional identity of teachers, meaningfulness in pedagogical work, motivation and educational content. The research results revealed that the social, extrinsic, introjected and identified regulation motivation in vocational schools and universities of applied sciences vary considerably; in universities of applied sciences social and identified regulation motivations manifest themselves, whereas in vocational schools a lot of demotivating factors related to the problems of vocational student identity, career prestige of a vocational teacher and external motivation, are observed. The role of vocational school and university of applied sciences teachers in the didactic process also varies: university of applied sciences lecturers identify themselves in the position of the teacher-andragogue, whereas vocational school teachers see their role as a professional (expert). Moreover, the principles of social constructivism in pedagogy and andragogy are more effective among university of applied sciences lecturers, while vocational school teachers often have to rely on the behaviouristic principles of pedagogy for educational assessment and the enhancement of student motivation."

This paper makes a descriptive review of the most relevant scientific literature of the last ten years focused on the use of educational technology. This revision is essential because is an educational topic in constant evolution and change due to advances related to digital technology. The results show how all the educational cycles have been investigated. Thus, in the case of early childhood education, the design of specific software is detected; In primary school it has been detected that students with certain previous knowledge of music have significantly developed their skills; In secondary school, there is a transversality of learning, despite the fact that some use is detected to reinforce traditional content, wasting the new possibilities, the teacher's use of information and communication technologies (ICT) in their continuing education is also shown; in higher education, online teaching stands out as a new educational business model and a constant attempt to include experiences from outside the classroom within it; in professional education, emphasis has been placed on the use of portfolios as a formative evaluative tool, and in overcoming the unidirectionality of the first proposals; and in educational settings with special needs, greater emphasis is placed on the development of interpersonal and intrapersonal skills."

        "This article discusses the research findings from the start-up phase of an innovative information and communication technology (ICT) project focused on ICT integration as a complex process involving many factors such as leadership, school readiness and organisational culture. Known locally as Hermes, the project's core objective was to provide an improved and trouble-free' ICT infrastructure for schools using thin client technology and a wireless broadband network, which would be managed centrally rather than locally. It was anticipated that this solution would help remove the barriers associated with ICT integration caused by technical issues. Based on an in-depth study of innovation adoption in eight schools involving a survey (n=119 teachers) and interviews (n=60 teachers), the study portrays a picture of the ICT integration patterns prior to and during the Hermes intervention in terms of schools' ICT readiness, leadership and vision. This small scale study can help us understand first- and second-order barriers to ICT integration in schools. In particular, this study informs us about the ecology of schools and ICT-based innovation, innovation scalability and contributes to a critical study of educational technology via a context-rich account of how educational technology is actually being mediated, rather than an idealised account of how technology could be used."

        "The twenty-first century has seen unprecedented investment from governments around the world in educational technologies in schools. This paper investigates Australian teachers' adoption and use of a popular technology that has been extensively supported by governments and school systems: the interactive whiteboard (IWB). The study suggests that a number of the barriers identified in the early days of adoption and use of this technology, such as professional support and access, still remain for many teachers, thereby impeding effective practices. The research also found that primary school teachers were using the technology in diverse ways, in contrast to secondary teachers who were using the IWB mainly for instructionist, presentational purposes. We conclude by considering various ways of reducing the effect of the identified barriers to support implementation of educational technologies in the classroom, especially the next generation of technologies promoted by governments and systems."

        "Background.Keeping high school students engaged and motivated to learn complex scientific concepts can be difficult and challenging; this is especially true if the task feels daunting and unfamiliar to the students. Incorporating educational technology, such as KAHOOT, into the classroom can help students learn scientific material even when it is difficult. Aim. Our objective is to determine the effectiveness of gamification in an Advanced Placement Biology (AP biology) classroom by using the online game 'KAHOOT!' as a supplement to traditional teacher-centered learning. In addition, we determine the use of 'KAHOOT!' in enhancing student engagement and the learning experience for biology. Methods. A presentation on Transcription and Translation was given to a small group of high school AP Biology students (n = 18, 18 women). After the presentation, the students were given 15 questions and twenty seconds to answer each question in the 'KAHOOT!' game. Both the students and the teacher were given a post-activity survey to assess their interest in the activity. Results. Based on the responses in the Students' Survey, 'KAHOOT!' can be used as a gamified assessment tool to help students learn the topic of 'Transcription and Translation' by actively engaging them in a fun and exciting manner. Conclusion. The overall activity had a positive impact on the students and teacher as the students enjoyed learning Transcription and Translation through the use of 'KAHOOT!'."

        "Prior research has shown negative relations between math anxiety and math performance. We posit that one potential pathway through which math anxiety influences performance of math equivalencies is through help seeking behavior during learning. Here, we examine whether middle school students' behavior, specifically the frequency of hint requests, within educational technologies mediates the association between math anxiety and performance of math equivalence. Students completed a pretest measuring their performance of math equivalence and math anxiety prior to the intervention, and a posttest measuring their performance of math equivalence. We examine mediation in two online math learning technologies: From Here to There (FH2T) and ASSISTments. In both FH2T and ASSISTments, students can request hints that provide just-in-time support during problem solving. We examined whether the frequency of hint requests mediates the effects of math anxiety on performance in both conditions. Using multi-group mediation analyses, we found that math anxiety was not a predictor of hint usage in either condition when controlling for pretest performance. Further, we found that students with lower performance at the pretest used more hints in the problem set condition, and using more hints was associated with lower performance of math equivalence at the posttest. This relation was not significant in the FH2T condition, suggesting a fundamental difference in hint usage between the two technologies. These findings have implications for designing educational technologies that simultaneously promote math performance and productive help seeking behaviors in middle school students."

Augmented reality is generating new opportunities for the development of ubiquity within educational environments. The objective of this study was to analyze the impact that the integration of ubiquitous game approaches with augmented reality has on learning. A quasi-experimental study was carried out with 91 sixth-grade primary school students; the learning scenario was designed and the augmented reality application \"WallaMe\" was selected for use in five sessions of a didactic unit in Art Education. Through pretest and posttest procedures, academic performance and information search skills were evaluated, and, a Likert scale analyzed the motivation and collaboration variables among the students. The results showed that the experimental group obtained statistically significant improvements in the academic performance of the subject, motivation, in the search for, and analysis of, information, level of fun and collaboration. The conclusion is that the dynamic activities managed in the intervention, which made use of augmented reality and localization, benefit teaching-learning processes, and encourage innovation and improvement through educational technology."

The authors justify the cultural-linguistic content of the program by the compliance with the modern scientific and methodological trends in studying and teaching Russian as a foreign language: forming the linguistic, communicative and cultural-linguistic competence through addressing notions such as national cultural code, national mentality, cross-cultural dialogue etc. The materials of the study include the results of the questionnaire taken by the potential students in the open education course within the program \"In Search of the National Russian Code: Educational Paths\". The article features the analysis of 165 questionnaires by respondents from different student groups: postgraduate students, university and college teachers and schoolteachers in the Republic of Kazakhstan. The authors analyze the answers in three content blocks: motivation for education; the most relevant questions that should be included in the courses; the most efficient ways of presenting material, that is, educational technologies, forms and techniques based on which the interaction between the subjects of open courses should be built. The results of the study allow authors to make conclusions about the potential students' preferences and interests and round up the most relevant issues and popular educational technologies. Based on the study, the authors have designed the content and methodological solutions of the educational module \"Man and the world as mirror of the Russian word\" within the curriculum of open education courses."

Specifically, it seeks to examine how this integration influences the acquisition of concepts and the development of scientific thinking skills. The study population included all secondary school biology teachers in four educational regions. A simple random sample was used, based on the records of the Ministry of Education in Iraq. The data from this research was analysed using SPSS 21, a statistical package commonly used in the social sciences. The study revealed a significant impact on students' acquisition of scientific concepts and thinking because of using educational technology tools. This study's findings are anticipated to make a valuable contribution to the ongoing discussion on pedagogical practices. By emphasising the correlation between the utilisation of technological resources and students' grasp of concepts and scientific thinking skills, educators and policymakers can make well-informed choices regarding the incorporation of technology into biology classrooms. The involvement of teachers and students in this study will not only contribute to their knowledge but also serve as inspiration for future research and educational initiatives focused on using technology to improve science education.

Some foresee dramatic, revolutionary change while others speculate that growth in educational technology will be buffeted both by modest expansion and unevenness. To this debate we contribute evidence from four groups across six countries on four continents: college and university educators (n = 281), students (n = 4243), senior administrators (n = 15), and instructional design specialists (n = 43). Our focus is on the future of digital learning after the pandemic-induced pivot to emergency remote instruction. Using data from interviews and self-administered questionnaires, our findings reveal a high degree of congruency between respondent groups, with most envisioning more blended/hybrid instruction post-pandemic and some modest increases in fully online courses. Student opinion is more sceptical about future change than within the other groups. Among respondents in all groups there is little expectation for a full-blown, revolutionary change in online or digital learning."

        "The integration of digital technologies in the classroom is a complex and multidimensional process with different dynamics including, among others, those related to: the digital culture of the center, the competency of teachers and students, the support of families and innovation within educational programs. This paper presents a systematic literature review (SLR) to analyze how the curricular integration of educational technology in classroom practice has been developed at non-university levels in recent years. The PRISMA 2020 standards have been applied. For the selection of articles, the ERIC database was used, taking as a reference, key concepts from its Thesaurus, related to the objective of the research, performing a temporal search of scientific articles from 2018 up to the present day. After screening according to the inclusion criteria established by consensus among researchers, a total of 88 articles were obtained (n = 88). The main results point to several variables that should be strengthened to promote the integration of digital technologies in the classroom, among which teacher training stands out as a determining factor, with special emphasis on initial training. This opens a debate about the training that future teachers receive in relation to the integration of digital technologies in the teaching process.Systematic review registration[]."

        "Despite the enthusiasm for technology in school education, the importance attributed to it by policymakers, educators, students and parents, and the extensive impact of the changes in practices and provision related to the adoption of digital technologies, research has provided little evidence that the adoption of digital technologies has led to improved outcomes for learners. Given the significant, ongoing investment in technology and research evidence that technology has potential to improve learning outcomes, it is timely for education systems and schools to have access to tools and frameworks that can support effective use of technology in education. This paper introduces the Education Technology Value Evaluation Tool, a set of frameworks designed to help teachers and school leaders focus on the ways in which educational technology can be used to address student learning needs and drive learning improvement. This tool was developed based on a review of the literature on effective use of technology and evidence from practice from ACER system and school reviews in Australia. It provides a simple, structured approach to highlighting learning related goals for technology adoptions, defining metrics for success and establishing criteria for ongoing evaluation. It is envisaged that this framework will support schools to focus their resources and efforts in using technology to drive improved outcomes for all students."

In this paper, which is based on one of the largest ICT studies in secondary schools in Norway, we explore the relationship between upper secondary school teachers' digital competence analysed by demographic, personal and professional characteristics. The implications of this study are that demographic, personal and professional characteristics, such as a teacher's age, work experience, gender, screen time and ICT education, predict teachers' high or low digital competence in upper secondary school to a certain degree. Further research is recommended in order to validate these preliminary findings."

The article suggests that although India is considered a global leader in digital technology, its primary and secondary school system suffers from digital poverty with associated tensions for school leadership. The paper explores the nature of teaching and learning in a selection of girls' schools in India during Covid-19. In the context of the pandemic, school leaders have had to respond quickly to remote learning, supporting teachers to facilitate the use of educational technology. Our research examined the experience of leadership in a cross section of schools from different geographical and socio-economic backgrounds. The respondents reflected on their engagement with digital literacy and remote teaching methodologies, and how the pandemic changed the classroom experience with little or no lead in time to adapt. The article examines how Indian women in positions of educational leadership perceive digital power or poverty and how it affects change and challenge in their leadership responsibility. Conclusions are drawn regarding educational practices operational at present and anticipate considerations which must be acknowledged to support virtual learning into the future."

        "This article is a descriptive and reflective piece on the strategic adaptations that facilitated and enabled the teaching of anatomy and related basic medical sciences to medical students in an African medical school that never shut down during the COVID-19 induced lockdown of the year 2020. The article considers the roles of educational technology, innovations, media and how these were used to achieve learning objectives with optimal outcomes during the lockdown. Specific technologies and innovations including the Anatomage Table, Complete 3D Anatomy software, and the use of High-Fidelity Mannequin were deployed to facilitate effective teaching of anatomy and related basic medical sciences. This was aided by the robust use of a learning management system Canvas, as well as internet facility for connection, videoconferencing, online sessions and online-based assessment in a strategically organised manner. This system was dynamic enough to respond to changes in COVID-19 related government policies including the lockdown and social distancing-related adjustments in the physical settings. The outcome was that the teaching of medical students did not stop, and optimal results were achieved. The article considers the roles of educational technology and innovations as well as the media and how these were used to achieve learning objectives with optimal outcomes during the lockdown. It is believed that this experiential piece would inspire and inform other medical schools on the benefit of building robustly dynamic medical school systems as well as the use of innovations in times of challenges. The article also considers both the limitations and benefits of technology in teaching anatomy. Very importantly, specific tools, innovations, and technologies were considered as used, and the information provided might be a guide for other potential users. Ultimately, the lesson learned would be of use to us and we believe we could also benefit many others."

        "A major step forward in educational technology is the application of Data Science additionally Artificial Intelligence (AI) into undergraduate English courses. Improving teaching approaches and student involvement in the context of English language acquisition is an important issue that this study seeks to address. Even though there have been great strides in educational technology, conventional English classes still have a hard time meeting the demands of their different student bodies and offering individualized lessons. This is a major problem that prevents English language training from being effective, according to the material that is already available. In this study, we provide an approach to this issue called English Smart Classroom Teaching with the Internet of Things (ESCT-IoT). Utilizing data science techniques, artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms, and Internet of Things (IoT) sensors, ESCT-IoT intends to provide a personalized learning environment that is both immersive and adaptable. The fuzzy hierarchical evaluation technique is used to determine the assessment's final result, which measures the smart classroom's instructional impact. To overcome the limitations of conventional education, ESCT-IoT gathers and analyses data in real time to give adaptive material, individualized feedback, and learning suggestions. There are noticeable benefits as compared to traditional methods of instruction when it comes to evaluation metrics like student engagement, learning outcomes, and teacher satisfaction. Furthermore, ESCT-IoT is excellent in encouraging active learning, improving language fluency, and boosting overall academic achievement, according to qualitative comments from both students and teachers."

Thus, development of students' technology skills is an on-going and persistent issue. Standards from the Partnership for 21st Century Skills and the International Society for Technology in Education encourage educators to teach skills that help students adapt to changing working environments. These skills resemble the National Association for Gifted Children's program and teacher preparation standards. Descriptive research about what is already occurring in classrooms has been done, but the information is frequently limited to a list of activities. A qualitative multi-case phenomenological study of six Alabama teachers of the gifted examined how they use and shape technology experiences with students, and promote student learning of 21st century skills. The teachers were chosen for the case study due to their reputation as teachers skilled in using technology with students. Lesson plans, interviews, and observations were used to discover themes between the teachers. Findings from the research indicate that educational technology use with students is shaped by factors such as teacher attitudes and expertise, available equipment and support, pedagogical decisions related to working with technology, and the particular student group participating in the technology use."

In the next section the recent domain of educational neuroscience is discussed as a crossroads of educational science, psychology and neuroscience. Thereafter, it is argued that research on mathematics education calls on the contribution of many disciplines such as mathematics, pedagogy, the psychology of cognition and math-related beliefs, and anthropology. The final example focuses on educational technology that requires interaction between educational science, psychology, computer science, economics, etc."

        "Informed by 'critical' approaches to 'educational technology', this paper aims to move away from presenting a 'could' and 'should' explanation of children learning with technology to a more nuanced, context-rich analyses of how information and communication technologies (ICTs) are being used by technologically privileged families at home. Here, a critical approach means locating the findings within a framework, which not only includes reference to the policies and politics of educational technology, but also takes account of uneven, contested, and contradictory uses of ICT in everyday family life. To achieve this, the paper presents accounts of technology use in situ from eight case families. The data reveal that although ICTs were purchased for their perceived educational potential, how parents and children approached and used them in the home for learning was entwined with many other dimensions of social life. The findings suggest that there is a need to move beyond one-dimensional debates, such as access to ICT ensures use, to more nuanced accounts that focus on the 'messy' realities of ICTs usage 'as it happens' in the home. In sum, more explicit empirically based information on ICT practices in the home need to be made available for policymakers and families."

        "This research compared the process of disciplinary literacy acquisition of students who experienced two different pedagogical approaches to learning science, technology, engineering and mathematics through astronomy (STEM-A). The objective of this study was to explore the impact of a digital storytelling (DST) educational technology intervention in a STEM-A context on the process of disciplinary literacy acquisition of students who were learning English as a foreign language (EFL). The research was designed as a type IV case study with a sample of 30 students from Kyrgyzstan aged between 12 and 16 years. Data were collected from written responses to the astronomy diagnostic tests (ADT), which were coded against the structure of the observed learning outcomes (SOLO) and analysed using the analysis of variance (ANOVA) with repeated measures on the occasion of testing. Data from the Australian sample, native speakers of English, (N = 328) were used as a baseline. The results showed a positive effect of the DST intervention on EFL students' astronomy disciplinary literacy acquisition. The research contributes to the body of knowledge on educational technology by exemplifying how the DST teaching intervention could bridge the gap between EFL and non-EFL students' disciplinary literacy acquisition in STEM areas."

        "University and college students are fully immersed in a participatory, interactive, digital culture that permeates every aspect of their lives. Today's educators must find ways to integrate educational technology into their curriculum to fully engage their students in the learning process. The difficulty for educators is vetting educational technologies for pedagogical effectiveness and devoting time to work with them prior to classroom integration. Those responsible for creating faculty professional development training opportunities will find self-directed online learning modules coupled with a virtual learning community an effective training tool. Structured inquiry-based learning, which relies on self-direction, curiosity, and knowledge creation, serves as the framework for such professional development efforts. Faculty and staff from 10, public institutions in New York State created an inquiry-based, self-directed, learning community called Tools of Engagement Project (TOEP). The goal was to help faculty and staff identify and master Web 2.0 tools relevant to their teaching needs for integration into their skill set. Approximately 300 faculty and staff from across these 10 institutions met in a virtual environment during a four-month period to actively engage in a collegial, online community where they were encouraged by mentors and fellow participants to learn about Web 2.0 tools. Results of pre- and post-surveys and participants' comments have shown this self-directed format to be an effective professional development training tool. The pace of TOEP and the differential teaching and learning aspect of the modules have helped faculty and staff who struggle to find the time to integrate these pervasive technologies into their teaching practice."

Educational gamification introduces typical elements of games in the classroom and the use of ICT as a tool to facilitate the teaching-learning process. The aim of this study is to classify, structure, and analyse the gamified systems that teachers display on the Internet through blogs. By means of a descriptive, non-experimental methodological design supported by data obtained from educational blogs, 111 edublogs with gamified experiences related to the educational stages of Secondary Education, Training Cycles, and Baccalaureate are analysed, and they contain at least four of the following game-based components: points, badges, classification tables, progress bars, missions or tasks, medals, rewards for effort or uncertain rewards, feedback, and interaction between players. The homogeneity in the constructs considered indicates that teachers become aware of their own identity as a facilitator of ICT-assisted play systems. The educational technology adopted reveals passive activity on the part of the students, who are the recipients of a system whose educational objectives are built around a change of attitude or an increase in motivation for the subject. An ample use of technological tools necessary to execute an efficient gamified system is detected, as well as the value of their use to motivate learning. Aspects such as the absence of interactions on blogs and the analysis of ICT tools used lead us to consider that the student's role is limited to a mere recipient of rules, points, and badges in exchange for traditional tasks."

The main objective of this work was to design and validate a questionnaire for non-university teachers with the main purpose of identifying the most important factors of their teaching attitude towards the use of emerging technological resources. Taking the Theory of Planned Behaviour and its subsequent development as reference behavioural research models, we developed a questionnaire that interrelatedly combines the following factors: perceived usefulness, perceived self-efficacy, facilitating conditions and the subjective norm. A total of 661 teachers were recruited from public schools in La Rioja (Spain). Content validity, construct validity, internal consistency and reliability of the questionnaire were undertaken as part of the validation process. The results showed good psychometric qualities in the questionnaire and indicated that the instrument is reliable and a valid measure to identify the factors that explain the teaching attitude towards technological resources. The findings have both theoretical and practical implications for the educational administration, management teams and teachers."

        "Providing access to and training in ICTs is seen as key to bridging the digital divide between technology-rich communities and those with poor IT infrastructures. Several projects have focused on providing ICTs for education in developing countries, of which the best known is One Laptop Per Child (OLPC). Although, there has been significant criticism of some of these projects, in particular OLPC, due to its use of a top-down implementation strategy and the limited evidence for its educational benefits, there has been comparatively little analysis of what underlies successful approaches. We aimed to address this deficit by conducting an ethnographic study of community-based projects organised by Blue Sparrow, a small charity that donates refurbished desktop computers to schools in rural Peru, as this organisation has experienced both successes and failures when implementing its educational technology projects. The relative success of Blue Sparrow highlights the benefits of: understanding local contexts; using a bottom up approach; involving stakeholders in setting programme objectives; and empowering communities. We argue that the educational impact of such projects can be improved by: providing teacher training; integrating computers into the wider curriculum; and providing teaching materials and clear objectives for volunteers."

        "Technological progress is a feature of everyday life in society, and school, as an integral part of it, must follow this development with changes in educational practice. School must work towards inclusion and equity of learning for all pupils. In this context, educational technologies appear to be very relevant tools regarding their potential for improving the education of children with learning difficulties. One of these educational technologies is the Scratch platform. The main objective of this study was to understand how the use of the Scratch software can contribute to the learning of mathematical content, specifically the affine function, by two children with learning difficulties. The research consisted of the application of a pre-test, followed by a two-session intervention and concluded with the application of the post-test. The mixed methodology focused on the quantitative analysis of pre- and post-test results and on the qualitative analysis of elements of the students' records, of the elements that they produced in the computer and of the researcher's field notes. The results suggest that the intervention had a significant impact on the overall performance of the two students, although with different relevance. The results also indicate that the work developed in Scratch enabled the students to have a better understanding of concepts, rules and symbols of mathematics. Despite the obvious limitations of this study and the impossibility of generalizing results, the conclusions provide arguments in favour of confirming Scratch as a valid and capable alternative for the promotion of learning, mathematical learning and the development of children with learning difficulties."

In order to propose alternative development methodologies, the research started from the the study of the Critical Theory of Technology and the Participatory Design. As a starting point it is necessary to deeply analyze this context. Through content analysis of teachers and managers' speech from three public schools, it was identified within the scope of the school culture, topics related to infrastructure policies and management of the educational system and to social perceptions related to the TDIC's pedagogic potentialities and the role of teachers in its integration. In the context of the culture of school, statements allowed us to understand the impact of infrastructure in the pedagogical practice; how the school management deals with issues related to TDIC integration; the potentialities of TDIC recognized by the school and the previous experiences of the teachers. Based on this analysis, actions were defined in the scope of creating, training and collective political action."

        "It goes without saying that technology has influenced virtually all spheres of our lives, and teaching English as a foreign language (EFL) is not an exception to this rule. Also, teachers' undeniable and decisive role in the integration of technology into teaching is not to be taken a blind eye on. With this in mind, this study explored Iranian high school EFL teachers' attitudes toward, their perceived competency in, and their actual use of instructional technology in their classrooms. 120 randomly selected junior and senior high school Iranian EFL teachers filled out The Survey of High School EFL Teachers' Attitudes toward Computer Technology. Over 600 junior and senior high school students filled out Students' Questionnaire Surveying the Use of Educational Technology by English Teachers in Classrooms. The results indicated that even though Iranian teachers have an overall positive attitude toward (computer) technology, they are not sufficiently competent to use it in their classes, and this lack of competence may be one of the main barriers to the full use of technology in their classes."

Theoretically grounded in the diffusion of innovations theory and the theory of planned behavior, the current research investigates teachers' psychological resistance to digital innovation, school culture and climate, and moderation of teacher attitudes toward educational technologies. A cross-sectional field survey of 600 business and entrepreneurship school teachers was conducted in Jordan. In this study, partial least square-structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) was used to assess the variables' \"direct and moderating impacts\" using the Smart PLS software 3.0. According to the results, school culture and school innovation climate had a considerable positive impact on teachers' resistance to digital innovation. Additionally, teachers' attitudes toward educational technologies moderated the relationship between study constructs in the framework. The study is a significant advance to the literature related to entrepreneurship, business education, and digital innovation. Several key policy insights and recommendations for further research, as well as theoretical and practical implications, are suggested."

      "AB": [
        "Schools' use of digital technology has so far proved to be a peripheral feature of the Conservative-Liberal education agenda. Through a series of reductions to previously extensive bureaucratic and funding structures, the Coalition administration has presided over a swift but sustained withdrawal of state support for digital technology use in schools. Many commentators have been quick to decry these actions as signalling an ill-informed \"absence of ambition\" for what could be seen as an integral area of twenty-first century educational provision. However, this paper contends that the Coalition's apparent technological indifference instead marks a deliberate \"ambition of absence\". Thus as well as contributing to immediate reductions in central government spending, the apparent shunning of educational technology policy-making has been driven by the Coalition's long-term ambitions for localised and largely privatised forms of public sector governance. With this in mind, the paper considers the intended influence of the Coalition's policy reversals on the future use of digital technology in UK schools. It is suggested that rather than constituting an irreversible crisis, the current withdrawal of state support is perhaps best understood as a continuation of the fluctuating cycle of government (dis) interest in educational technology over the past 30 years."

        "Educational technology (EdTech) designers need to ensure population validity as they attempt to meet the individual needs of all students. EdTech researchers often have access to larger and more diverse samples of student data to test replication across broad demographic contexts as compared to either the small-scale experiments or the larger convenience samples often seen in experimental psychology studies of learning. However, the source of typical EdTech data (i.e., online learning systems) and concerns related to student privacy often limit the opportunity to collect demographic variables from individual students-the sample is diverse, but the researcher does not know how that diversity is realized in individual learners. In order to ensure equitable student outcomes, the EdTech community should make greater efforts to develop new methods for addressing this shortcoming. Recent work has sought to address this issue by investigating publicly-available, school-level differences in demographics, which can be useful when individual-level variation may be difficult or impossible to acquire data for. In this study, we use this approach to better understand the role of social factors in students' self-regulated learning and motivation-related behaviors, behaviors whose effectiveness appears to be highly variable between groups. We demonstrate that school-level demographics can be significantly associated with the relationships between students' help-seeking behavior, motivation, and outcomes (math performance and math self-concept). We do so in the context of reasoning mind, an intelligent tutoring system for elementary mathematics. By studying the conditions under which these relationships vary across different demographic contexts, we challenge implicit assumptions of generalizability and provide an evidence-based commentary on future research practices in the EdTech community surrounding how we consider diversity in our field's investigations."

Students' perception on the intervention as well as the change in students' conceptual understanding after the intervention was explored. Quasi-experimental design was used. The participants in this study, two Grade 9 high school classes, were purposively chosen and were assigned to the treatment and the control groups. Flipped Classroom was implemented in the treatment group while the traditional method was used in the control group. Students' perception on the implementation of the Flipped Classroom was gathered using group interview while conceptual understanding before and after the intervention was measured using EMCS. After the intervention, the students have expressed positive feedbacks on the utilization of technology and provision of various activities in the classroom. It is also revealed that there was a significant improvement on the conceptual understanding of the students in both control and treatment groups. However, it is noted that the student in the treatment group has significantly higher gain scores. Results revealed that Flipped Classroom yielded a positive impact on the students' understanding. Moreover, it improved the teaching practice in general. This research may contribute not only in the area of physics education but on the entire field of education as well. The number of respondents used and time of implementation limits the generalizability of the findings. However, this study can be a basis on the possible impact of active learning and use of educational technology on students understanding and perceptions and attitude towards learning."

The graduate students, who also were the participants in this study, implemented the GIE project by communicating and exchanging information with teachers in other countries. The study participants were provided with twenty questions that they could use as a guide to maintain journals regarding their thoughts and experiences related to their implementation of the GIE project. Because the study participants and teachers in other countries worked with their K-12 students, several such students were involved, albeit indirectly, in the GIE project. Seventeen journals maintained by the study participants were analyzed and the findings of the study are reported in this paper. The overall findings indicate that even though there were some initial issues associated with the GIE project, the project was successfully implemented by a majority of the study participants."

        "This chapter reviews ICT and education policy in the United States and Canada; both countries have populations with diverse cultures, languages, socioeconomics, and ideologies. Generally local school authorities provide education, while state/ territory and national bodies exert influence. Focus areas in this chapter include ICT infrastructure, protections for student data and privacy, data interoperability, personalized learning, online assessment, and updates to national technology standards and frameworks. In addition to evolving infrastructure, issues related to supporting \"future-ready\" learning, perhaps of equal importance, is the ongoing evidence-based evaluation of educational technology and effort to increase the pace and rigor of evidence associated with educational technology purchases and renewals by school districts. Some school systems are moving toward a competency-based education (CBE) model which often requires policy shifts. There is growing interest in exploring new models for teacher preparation and development as well as calls for increased personalization of student learning. Policy debates continue around the degree of equal access to technology that government should require, including whether parity should be required in terms of device age and availability, quality and availability of digital learning materials, and classroom bandwidth and whether the technology is being used actively or passively by students across all socioeconomic groups and across all schools. As policy makers grapple with the displacement of jobs and loss of employment due to advances in technology and continued growth in income inequality, they may turn to policies that encourage better alignment between K-12 education and the skills needed for future careers."

        "Context Challenges in designing digital learning come from the complexity and ever-changing nature of socio-technological systems. Following an autopoietic logic can assist the design of technology-enhanced learning (TEL) systems and their digital learning affordances in education. Problem The lack of self-maintenance and adaptability considerations in educational technology design, to maintain the efficiency and engagement of TEL systems within ever-changing conditions over time. The concept of autopoiesis, and the 4E+ cognition framework can provide a guiding framework for a more adequate type of the design of TEL systems in education. Method I exlplore the philosophical and practical aspects of the concept of autopoiesis and 4E+ cognition in the design of digital learning affordances and TEL systems in education. This is motivated by the apparent potential of autopoiesis principles and ideas to inform the design of efficient and engaging digital learning affordances and TEL systems over time. The 4E+ cognition framework is applied to understand the learners' experience, which in turn informs design principles. Results Following an autopoiesis and 4E+ cognition framework to configure TEL systems and digital learning affordances has the potential, in theory, to increase the ongoing efficiency and learning engagement of TEL systems in education. An increased efficiency of TEL systems, in turn, can improve the learning process and outcomes for learners, by offering them enhanced digital learning affordances over time. Implications Embedding autopoiesis, along with 4E+ cognition, in the design of educational technology can guide educational technologists, designers, researchers and practitioners to design more efficient, engaging and long-lasting TEL systems, while addressing the challenges found today in education. Constructivist content The constructivist content is grounded in the epistemology of the Santiago school of cognition, coming from the work of Humberto Maturana and Francisco Varela."

        "There is no questioning that the way people live, interact, communicate, and conduct business is undergoing a profound, rapid change. This change is often referred to as the \"digital revolution,\" which is the advancement of technology from analog, electronic and mechanical tools to the digital tools available today. Moreover, technology has begun to change education, affecting how students acquire the skill sets needed to prepare for college and a career and how educators integrate digital technological instructional strategies to teach. Numerous studies have been published discussing the barriers of integrating technology, the estimated amount of investment that is needed in order to fully support educational technology, and, of course, the effectiveness of technology in the classroom. As such, this article presents a critical review of the transitions that technology integration has made over the years; the amount of resources and funding that has been allocated to immerse school with technology; and the conflicting results presented on effectiveness of using is technology in education. Through synthesis of selected themes, we found a plethora of technological instructional strategies being used to integrate technology into K-12 classrooms. Also, though there have been large investments made to integrate technology into K-12 classrooms to equip students with the skills needed to prepare for college and a career, the practical use of this investment has not been impressive. Lastly, several meta-analyses showed promising results of effectiveness of technology in the classroom. However, several inherent methodological and study design issues dampen the amount of variance that technology accounts for."

        "The use of educational technologies in schools is being reshaped by a new kind of intermediary organization that brokers relations between schools, academia, governance, and industry. In this article we define and examine 'edtech brokers' as organizations that operate between the edtech industry, public schools, research centers and governments, guiding schools in the procurement and pedagogical use of edtech. Edtech brokers have remained mostly unexplored despite their potential to redraw the boundaries between public education and the global edtech market. We claim that edtech brokers have become increasingly relevant in the past years, embedding new types of professionalities into education, and taking an active role in co-creating and updating schools' digital infrastructures, the evidence-making mechanisms around edtech, and the pedagogical practices around edtech. The article proposes three distinct categories of edtech brokers - ambassador, search engine, and data brokers - and explores their practices of mediation. By doing so, we outline the potential effects that brokers can have on schools and edtech markets, and we disentangle their specific imaginaries of the future of education they promote, often aligned with wider policy desires for reform."

        "Continued innovation in networked digital technologies brings both opportunities and challenges to educators, educational system designers, and policy makers. This situation is exacerbated in developing countries where there is marked disparity of educational opportunities and achievements compared with developed countries. With a global population having one out of five children out-of-school, UNESCO's agenda of quality 'Education for All' demands attention to a deteriorating situation. Advancements in learning technologies continue to be seen as key to solving the disparities with increasing diversity in the design, development and implementation of educational technology initiatives. This paper proposes a framework for underprivileged communities in Pakistan who do not have access to good schools, teachers and libraries. Contextualizing adaptable learning support, scalability of initiatives, and development of sustainable policies, however, is a continuous challenge. In reviewing relevant 'stand out' initiatives during the last two decades and socio-technological impacts on the communities they served, we discuss a range of issues and stakeholder perspectives framed by challenges arising from technological, pedagogical and localized perspectives. Principles are identified that might assist contextualized learning support models for remote and underprivileged communities, and a way forward is proposed in terms of a sustainable, scalable and adaptable teaching and learning model."

        "Educational Information and Communication Technology (ICT) can be an appropriate tool for creating flexible learning environments. ICT can contribute to flexibility through its potential to keep content up-to-date and to address personal learning needs. ICT could, thus, make learning more accessible to a wider group of students. However, doing this requires that educational tools and the ways they are used in the classroom are experienced as challenging and attractive and, most important, inclusive to the students using them. In order to support the learning of all users, differences between students should be taken into account. In four schools for secondary education in the Netherlands, the relationship between social scripts in educational tools and the inclusiveness of the use of these tools in classroom practice has been studied. Our analysis shows that educational tools indeed differ in the extent of inclusiveness for different groups of students, particularly in their instructional structure. Teachers appeared to reinforce the inclusiveness of the more inclusive tools, but, generally, did not affect the inclusiveness of the less inclusive tools. When more inclusive educational tools were used, students participated more actively - they read the texts better, they asked fewer questions and they collaborated more. This is particularly the case for girls and students from minority groups."

        "This non-experimental quantitative study investigated medical school faculty members' behavioral intention to use and actual usage behavior of technology in inquiry-based learning activities in medical schools in the United States by applying the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT). In medical education, situational problems for students to solve typically incorporate instructive clinical cases to guide problem-solving and prepare them for their professional lives as clinicians. Technology-infused inquiry-based learning pedagogy can require significant paradigm shifts for both students and instructors. It can impact the level of responsibility students take upon themselves for their own learning, and use of a pedagogy instructors may find unfamiliar, to deliver content. Major findings demonstrated performance expectancy, effort expectancy, and social influence had a significant relationship with behavioral intention to use technology for teaching medical education inquiry-based activities. Gender and voluntariness of use were both found to have significant effects on the relationship between performance expectancy and behavioral intention to use technology. The results of this study can aid stakeholders in providing support mechanisms for faculty to adopt technology for teaching and learning. This is possibly the first of its kind on the application of this theoretical model to address medical educators' behavioral intention to use and actual usage behavior of educational technologies for the delivery of inquiry-based learning activities."

An online questionnaire was used as a collection tool, in which the data were analyzed with a quantitative approach. It was identified that digital information and communication technology was perceived as a great support in the studies, but there was a high heterogeneity of their appropriation in the studies by freshmen or veterans, and more than half indicated that they rarely or never received an incentive from the teachers to use it. The appropriation of this resource can increase academic performance and reduce school dropout."

        "Adopting a differentiated and domain-specific view of educational technology, the present study focuses on the case of school history. It argues that, in this particular context, one of technology's main assets is its ability to support inquiry-based learning activities, during which students interpret the past through historical reasoning. As little is known about how history teachers use technology in the classroom, an exploratory study was carried out with 22 teachers in fourth grade of secondary education in Flanders (Belgium). Semi-structured interviews were used to investigate beliefs about technology, ways in which technology was implemented, and factors influencing the adoption process. The results suggest that most teachers held positive beliefs about technology, and that use of technology was driven by several rationales. Although a significant group of teachers was thoughtful of how their own use of technology could support students' learning, student use remained limited to instances where technology served as a resource for the task, rather than a tool for supporting cognitive or social activity. It appears that teachers were not yet aware of technology's ability to scaffold inquiry activities. Furthermore, limitations in school infrastructure often prevented them from experimenting with more pervasive student uses of technology."

        "A three-phase exploratory sequential mixed-method study was conducted to propose and test a model showing the interrelationships among the contextual factors influencing the science teachers' Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK). Though developing teachers' TPACK is critical for technology integration in education, the contextual factors influencing TPACK were mostly neglected and this study aimed to fill this gap in the literature. The first phase of the study was aimed to determine the contextual factors by interviewing science teachers and educational technology experts. The findings revealed nine common factors involving student influence, teachers' beliefs and attitudes, technological infrastructure, administrative support, technical support, colleague interaction, lack of time, professional development, educational technology experience. In the second phase, a path model was hypothesized based on qualitative study results and related literature. In the third phase, a valid and reliable scale, named Contextual Factors Scale was developed to measure these contextual factors. Then, a questionnaire involving this scale and TPACK was administrated to 348 science teachers. Showing complex interrelationships among contextual factors, the model explained 45% of the variance in science teachers' TPACK, with particular importance placed on professional development, teachers' beliefs and attitudes, administrative support, and student influence. Looking from a holistic perspective, this study provided a valuable model for guiding decision-makers, researchers, and practitioners about how to improve teachers' TPACK and technology integration in the schools. Considering the complex interrelationships in the model, some simultaneous strategies dealing with each factor should be applied to improve teachers' TPACK and technology-related practices in the schools."

        "Background One of the important elements of teachers' technology integration is Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK). Though there are studies on TPACK, limited information exists about its context element. This gap causes context-isolated studies for TPACK-related research. Purpose The aim of this research is to elaborate on science teachers' technology-based lesson practices in terms of contextual factors influencing TPACK. Sample The study participants consisted of 12 science teachers and 7 educational technologists by using snowball sampling. Design and method The case study design method was used in this study within the qualitative research paradigm. The data was collected with semi-structured interviews by following the protocol for strategic performance problems. The interviews were examined employing content analysis to reveal the themes. Results and conclusions The findings of the study indicated that TPACK is not only a stand-alone knowledge and skills, but also it is context-oriented. The multifaceted factors represent components of a multi-layered structure of the context. These factors can be perceived by the teachers at different levels according to school types. Furthermore, sub-themes of the contextual factors showed complex interrelationships. This study contributes to the literature by revealing the sub-themes of the context and in-depth examination of contextual factors suggested for future studies."

Augmented reality offers a wide range of possibilities in teaching -learning processes, not only when presenting and enriching information, but also when creating resources and acquiring certain skills in response to current needs. For this reason, it is important to work on digital skills related to this technology (augmented reality) in future teachers and appreciate their evolution. In this specific case, the objective pursued was to find out the level of knowledge developed by the students (men and women) of the Pedagogy degree at the University of Seville after a training experience that turned them into producers of augmented reality resources. For this, a questionnaire with different types of questions was carried out in which 77 students of the Educational Technology subject participated. The results obtained indicate that the incorporation of augmented reality in the teaching -learning processes is positive, since it promotes motivation, making the student body the creator of their own resources, favors the incorporation of new methodologies and enhances the development of techno-pedagogical knowledge and skills."

Despite their increasing prevalence in schools, most current technological educational environments do not promote creativity in students' interactions or support teachers' ability to detect creative thinking by students. Recent work in AI and Education has begun to bridge this gap from multiple perspectives, such as representations (computational models for describing creativity in technology-based learning environments), inference (algorithms for detecting creative outcomes from students' interactions with these environments), and visualizations (presentations for teachers in a way that aids their understanding of students' interactions and allow them to intervene with this process when deemed necessary). The workshop will provide a platform for researchers from different fields to share findings and discuss new research opportunities for combining AI and creativity in educational technologies. Importantly, we intend to invite a group of experts in creativity theory from the cognitive and psychological sciences to speak in the workshop. A first edition of the workshop in 2021 was very successful in attracting papers and audience."

        "Over the past decade, learning cultures worldwide have been affected differently by the rapid spread of educational technology. During emergency distance learning, teachers had to adapt themselves to a new mode of learning. The purpose of this study was to compare technology-integrated instructional strategies and teacher prototypes in three learning cultures during routine and emergency learning based on the Five Spaces for Design in Education framework (Weiner et al., 2020). The participants were 31 teachers from three regions - Eastern Europe, Western Europe, and Northern America, all integrating the same adaptive digital learning environment in second language instruction. Participants' interviews were coded according to a three level tier of instructional strategies (n = 938) denoting the student's place in the learning process and level of independence, as well as a categorization of four teacher prototypes representing the degree of teacher centrality in the classroom (n = 764): sage, facilitator, guide, and partner. Chi-square tests highlighted the differences in instructional strategies and teacher centrality between the learning cultures in the three regions. The findings of the teacher prototype analysis showed a similar distribution of prototypes among the three regions, both in routine learning and emergency times. Regarding instructional strategies, each culture showed a unique tendency to specific strategies, while in the transition to emergency learning there was a convergence to strategies with the medium level of teacher control over students and a certain degree of student independence."

Design/methodology/approach AARDVARC (Automated Approach to Reviewing and Developing Valuable Assessment Resources for your Curriculum) was created with the core function of standardizing course syllabi through the use of a web-based portal and the ability to query fields within the portal to collect multiple points of data. AARDVARC permits quick and efficient gathering of programmatic, curricular, faculty, teaching, preceptor and financial data to facilitate meaningful change and a shared responsibility of assessment. This software has allowed automatic completion of complex analytics each semester, including coverage of program outcomes, course learning objectives, teaching and assessment methods, course readings, topics covered in the curriculum, faculty teaching hours, experiential activities, coverage of disease states and scheduling of peer observation of teaching. Findings Three years after its initial launch, AARDVARC is now used by 520 faculty, 60 staff, 44 preceptors and over 2,000 students across multiple health profession and science programs. Data analytics through AARDVARC have allowed the School to reimagine how assessment can be conducted and have provided a pathway for making evidence-based programmatic and curricular changes. Originality/value This original software has provided an innovative approach to conduct assessment that combines best practices in curriculum, assessment, data analytics and educational technology while improving the overall quality, speed, and efficiency of academic and business operations."

        "Objective: Chiropractic institutions face the challenging quandary of how to prepare future doctors for entry into a society completely transformed by technology. At an increasing rate, the incoming student profile is representative of a digital generation with a high affinity for technology use. The aim of this study was 2-fold: (1) outline the basic elements of a technology integration program at our institution and (2) determine if a potential relationship exists between ongoing training and acceptance of such a programmatic shift among faculty and students. Methods: At each phase of technology integration, electronic survey instruments were deployed to participating students and faculty members. Survey instruments included question items assessed through Likert-type scales and open-ended questions to provide students and faculty members with a vehicle for providing specific feedback. To ensure anonymity of student and faculty survey respondents, the response collection source was a different department than the deployment of the survey emails. Participants were encouraged, but not required, to complete the surveys. Results: Analysis of survey responses generally found increases in overall participant satisfaction and acceptance of the technology integration with the provision of ongoing support systems. Conclusion: As suggested in similar scholarship in the field, the results of this study underscored the value of support systems for faculty members and students in an academic community. The systems that provided ongoing training and other support mechanisms seemed more accepted when tailored to myriad skill levels. Creating a culture in which faculty members and students felt adequately supported fostered the acceptance necessary for forward momentum of a campus initiative of significant change."

        "Background Augmented reality (AR) has been incorporated in context-aware ubiquitous learning (CAUL) designs to guide learners but few of the designs adopt specific learning theories. Furthermore, there are no CAUL design models that align learning theories to CAUL effectiveness. In addition, CAUL review papers have not documented CAUL developments since AR technology has become normalized. Objectives A phenomenological research method with expert design input was adopted to build theoretically informed CAUL design models and provide guidelines for AR-driven CAUL. Methods The researchers reviewed 38 empirical AR studies in education from 2016 to 2019 in seven high-impact journals of educational technology using a taxonomy based on CAUL learning theories. Seven domain experts reviewed the findings and provided insights into current developments, patterns of variables, and the proposed AR-guided CAUL model. The expert feedback was used to refine the CAUL models. Results and conclusions Research into humanity-related subjects are growing due to the features of AR, and the majority of studies were in primary education as AR corresponds well with lower-level cognitive learning tasks. Many AR functions cooccurred with situated learning theory, inquiry-based learning theory, and collaborative learning theory. A macro-design model and three micro-design models of AR-guided CAUL with specific learning theories was proposed. Major takeaways This study offers a set of AR-guided CAUL design models aligned with established learning theories. The variables in the CAUL studies are linked with learning theories to clearly show how AR guides learning. The models can guide instructors to meet their students' needs."

        "Numerous efforts seek to increase awareness, interest, and participation in scientific and technological fields at the precollege level. Studies have shown these students are at a critical age where exposure to engineering and other related fields such as science, mathematics, and technology greatly impact their career goals. A variety of advanced learning technologies have emerged to enhance learning, promote hands-on experiences, and increase interest in engineering. However, creating and sustaining technology-infused learning environments at the precollege level is a challenging task, as many schools have limited resources and expertise. Moreover, while numerous technology solutions are available to support ambitious engineering-learning goals, choosing the right technology to align to program goals and resources may be a daunting task. In this work, we fill the gap between the applicability of educational implements and suitable teaching methods for precollege engineering. We present an overview of available hardware- and software-based technologies, and characterize these technologies based on criteria such as median price, the type of learning activities fostered, and the required users' expertise levels. In addition, we outline how these technologies align with deductive and inductive teaching methods that emphasize direct-instruction, inquiry-, problem-, and project-based methods, as studies have shown these methods are effective for precollege engineering education."

        "Previous research investigating the use of technology in school has focused mainly on the fre-quency of use of digital tools during lessons rather than investigating how technology is inte-grated with respect to different kinds of learning activities.Since the impact of technology use on learning depends on how it is used and on what activities supported by technology are implemented in lessons, a measurement instrument assessing how technology is integrated into learning activities is necessary to investigate its impact on teaching and learning processes. According to the interactive, constructive, active, and passive (ICAP) framework, which distinguishes four different learning activities based on the level of students' cognitive engagement, we developed the 12-item ICAP Technology Scale (ICAP-TS) that accounts for all four dimensions of technology integration in lessons. We used confirmatory factor analysis to validate the four-factor structure of the ICAP-TS with a sample of 1050 upper-secondary school teachers from Switzerland. We also examined reliability using classical test theory and Rasch model analysis to assess the scale's psychometric characteristics. We then analyzed the associa-tions between the ICAP-TS and a general use frequency measure of 12 educational technologies to test the criterion validity. The results confirmed the four-factor structure of the ICAP-TS and revealed good instrument accuracy. The most difficult items to endorse are those describing the integration of technology into interactive learning activities. Furthermore, all 12 items signifi-cantly correlated with the frequency of use of 12 educational technologies. We recommend the ICAP-TS as a short and reliable measurement scale for assessing how technology is integrated into lessons, considering different learning activities based on the ICAP theoretical model."

        "Curricular hours for anatomical sub-disciplines (gross anatomy, embryology, histology, and neuroanatomy) continue to decline, while medical schools are simultaneously transitioning to systems-based, vertically integrated curricula. This requires students to learn and integrate all basic science content for a learning block prior to the summative assessment. Currently, no educational technology resource exists that integrates the four anatomical sub-disciplines into a single resource to supplement integrated curricula. The objective of this study was to assess a novel integrated anatomical sciences mobile app for medical students. The 4natomy mobile app was developed to integrate the four sub-disciplines for a single topic, the spinal cord. The app was distributed to first-year medical students during the neurological disorders learning. Following the learning block, assessment of the student acceptance and experience with the app was conducted through a technology acceptance model (TAM) framework survey. The results indicated that students found the app to be useful (p < 0.001) and easy to use (p < 0.05), predicting continued future usage of the app. Students requested expanded anatomy content for the entire learning block, as well as more clinical correlations, videos, and animations. The integrated anatomy mobile app developed in this study was useful and easy to use, indicating continued use within an integrated medical curriculum. This was the first study to utilize the TAM as a conceptual framework for technology assessment in medical education, suggesting that future studies that develop new technologies should adapt the TAM for user testing."

From a mixed approach that used quantitative and qualitative methods, data from 963 students were collected and analyzed on the domain and use of the virtual learning environment Redu. Data were collected through student interactions and classified according to eleven classes that were used to identify the level and characteristics of those interactions between students and educators. We also performed interviews with 13 students based on their interaction patterns (highly interact, sporadically interact, rarely interact) to characterize the students' interaction strategies within the virtual learning environment and strategies without the use of the virtual learning environment. It was found that students seek other means to interact and to send requests for help, regularly interact about school content, participate in discussions, and contact peers and teachers. The results can serve as a basis for proposing new functionalities for virtual learning environments."

Methods: Methodological study of 49 adolescents from public schools in Belem (PA) aged between 13 and 18 years comprising three steps: technology assessment; analysis of attributes to measure the degree of representativeness and clarity; and review according to adolescents' understanding. A wordsearch was presented to adolescents, who were asked to follow the reading guidelines, locate the highlighted words and answer the questions using the indicated locations. A Likert-type questionnaire was applied to describe the agreement among adolescents in relation to the attributes: objective, organization, writing style, appearance and relevance of the technology, considering the Content Validity Index with a cutoff point of 0.90. The textual corpus was processed in the R Interface pour les Analyses Multidimensionneles de Textes et de Questionnaires, 0.7 alpha 2. A word cloud graphic resource was used. Numerical data were summarized by the Statistic Package for the Social Sciences, version 22.0. Results: The attributes were satisfactorily evaluated, with an indication of full agreement ranging between 72.8% in writing style and 84.7% in the relevance of technology. The content validity indices obtained were above 0.90, and the texts generated three clouds corresponding to the definition of tuberculosis, disease transmissibility and clinical manifestation. Conclusion: The wordsearch proved to be valid for use with adolescents as a tool in educational actions on tuberculosis, and can contribute to self-care and multiplication of knowledge in their social network."

The methodology will be organized from workshops and conversation circles with educators and the development of a dialogic network in the digital environment in order to articulate teaching and technology. To deal with empirical emergencies, self-narratives and logbooks will contribute to map the processes of intoepistemogenesis of subjects in becoming. As a result, we believe that the development of this dialogical digital learning network may be an innovative action in the school context and enhance the weaving of bonds between teachers-technologies-school."

Along with rigorous coursework, preservice teachers are placed in K-12 environments to ensure they are prepared to address the needs of diverse learners. Preservice teachers: (a) learn content across multiple areas depending on desired level/area of certification; (b) study pedagogical approaches that are effective in addressing K-12 students' needs; (c) employ research-based strategies in K-12 settings; and, (d) take content and pedagogical exams for certification purposes. However, preservice teachers may be unfamiliar with newer educational technology such as floor-robots, a type of robotics that may support content learning, as well as engage K-12 students in critical thinking and/or problem solving. Increasing preservice teachers' awareness of new technologies may benefit their future K-12 students. The purpose of this research was to ascertain whether preservice teachers would accept floor-robots as a useful instructional tool to support learning. During an undergraduate education course, thirty-two Hispanic, preservice teachers were introduced to two types of floor-robots to enhance their awareness/use of an unfamiliar educational technology. Researchers in this study had previous experience introducing floor-robots to approximately 250 fourth and fifth graders across two academic school years. Researchers were interested in gauging preservice teachers' willingness to accept and/or use new technologies as an additional instructional strategy to support K-12 student learning."

We designed a learning environment based on three main design principles: (1) Mathematics as Artistic, where mathematics is used for open artistic creation; (2) Aesthetically rich mathematical experiences, that enable students to appreciate mathematical beauty and aesthetic experiences of wondering, imagining, conjecturing, testing, discovering, making connections, problem posing and solving; (3) Constructionism, where mathematical sense making is interwoven with constructing a personally meaningful digital artefact. Two students of the 11th grade participated in a case study, where they used expressive digital resources for representing, manipulating and exploring periodic functions in order to create an animated artefact based on a piece of music. The collected data fed the formation of a theoretical model for analysing students' aesthetically driven mathematical meaning making, in an attempt to structure existing theoretical concepts around mathematical aesthetics in education. A part of the analysis of students' aesthetic experiences based on this model is presented and further reflectively discussed with respect to the prospect of an aesthetically oriented curriculum reform."

Virtual learning environments (VLEs) are widely used, offering advantages to both students and instructors. Different platforms include various activity modules, within which collaborative learning communities are built, file sharing and grade handling are facilitated, and navigation log statistics are provided. These logs shed light on the daily use of the platform. The resulting information creates an overview of users' online navigation characteristics and preferences. Through the analysis of these navigation logs, relevant information can be extracted that may help in understanding the teaching-learning processes within VLEs. In this study, the navigation logs of students enrolled in a course offered at a School of Engineering were analyzed. The objective of this project was to analyze the characteristics of the students' navigation by identifying, summarizing and characterizing the way in which they interact with the platform. Based on the results, it is inferred that students apply different learning strategies and follow individualized navigation paths."

        "This response is about the role of \"orchestration\" as a useful metaphor to assist the investigation of technology-enhanced learning (TEL) settings. The paper argues that current positions on orchestration are based on a technologically-orientated viewpoint on the issue of technological under-usage in schools. The paper suggests that this is a form of circular reasoning, and a distraction from the actual, socially shaped dynamics at play. The paper's main contention is that orchestration is an opportunity to incorporate a more 'sociological' angle in TEL scholarship. Orchestration - as often used in the English language to signify 'political work' - is indeed a welcome addition to the field. Insofar as the metaphor allows teachers and researchers to recognise the complex interplay of influences, pressures, and expectations that surround the use of technologies. In other words, insofar as orchestration allows us to appreciate the 'political' nature of educational technology and the impacts of implementation. As such, orchestration can help us move away from an idealised understanding of teaching as a neutral practice, that is, the idea that teachers act always rationally, positively planning and executing their work to maximise learning for students.

        "Most K-12 outreach programs worldwide within materials science and beyond rely on scientists visiting K-12 classrooms and assisting teachers with instruction and development of classroom materials, as well as developing on-site professional development workshops. Due to the limited time materials scientists and teachers have available for participating in K-12 outreach programs, more creative approaches are necessary to accommodate the needs of a broader spectrum of teachers and students. Incorporating technology into K-12 outreach programs is one approach that can be used to overcome some of the obstacles currently faced. This article discusses different manners in which technology can be included in K-12 materials science outreach programs, such as K-12 educational software and tools as well as online professional development programs. This article also draws on broader educational technology research to identify known challenges of incorporating technology into outreach programs and possible ways to overcome such challenges."

Assessment is a cornerstone in modern and formal education and is particularly necessary for tracking progress, measuring knowledge or achievement, and planning future educational steps. This study investigates the effects of using an online game-based learning (GBL) approach in students' assessment in terms of their performance and self-efficacy in English as a foreign language (EFL) learning. A quasi-experiment was conducted on intermediate school-level students, who were divided into two groups, namely control and experimental. Each group underwent an English language test conducted through a Google Form and a role-playing game developed to mimic the functionality of an assessment tool. The results indicate that the performance of the experiment group was neither affected positively nor negatively using the GBL assessment tool. On the other hand, the results also show that using such a tool has positively affected students' self-efficacy levels."

Subjects involved technology directors and instructional technology specialists from school districts, and data collection involved interviews and a written questionnaire. Three broad philosophy of technology views were widely held by participants, including an instrumental view of technology, technological optimism, and a technological determinist perspective that sees technological change as inevitable. Technology leaders were guided by two main approaches to technology decision making in cognitive dissonance with each other, represented by the categories Educational goals and curriculum should drive technology, and Keep up with Technology (or be left behind). The researcher concluded that as leaders deal with their perceived experience of the inevitability of technological change, and their concern for preparing students for a technological future, the core category Keep up with technology (or be left behind) is given the greater weight in technology decision making. A risk is that this can on occasion mean a quickness to adopt technology for the sake of technology, without aligning the technology implementation with educational goals."

The findings for this study were generated from interviews and observations of high school principals. This qualitative research study revealed that administrators are apprehensive about social media in the classroom and that they need to become more familiar with it to better implement technology effectively in the classroom. To ease their apprehension, principals need to change their ways of thinking about social media's use. Professional development in technology skills needs to be more available and flexible for principals to become a more visionary technology leader in the 21st digital educational environment."

        "Mobile devices, especially the integration and adoption of iPads in school classrooms, is gaining emphasis across the research and development forums of academic, policy, organizational, political, and public spheres. In April 2012, the Danish government announced that they would allocate DKK 500 million to develop the use of IT in elementary schools in Denmark. Since then, many municipalities have purchased iPads for schools for large sums. The existing literature, however, says very little about how these IT resources are being used or should be used in teaching. This paper contributes to the knowledge of how teachers and students use iPads in school contexts. During fall 2013, three elementary schools' second and sixth graders were observed, and their subject teachers were interviewed. The researchers applied a social constructivist perspective and a qualitative research design, using grounded theory methodology. The relevant factors identified were available knowledge and adoptable practice (including innovation evaluation, subject culture, learning activity design, and teachers' and students' skill level with iPads); advantages (including mobility, multimodality, access to information, startup time, and differentiated learning environments); and adoption barriers (including accessibility, training, and economy) as seen in relation to technology, pedagogy, and content. The paper concludes that the identified nature of knowledge, practices, and barriers are similar to the trend of integrating and adopting desktop computers and other educational technologies. However, there are some unique advantages that iPad and other mobile devices can enable through apps, readiness, etc. Policies and strategies should be adopted to combine training and maintenance along with ensuring access to iPads."

To enable educational technology researchers and school teachers to thoroughly know the research foci and applications of concept maps in technology-supported learning environments for K-12 education (CM-K12), the present study conducted a systematic review of studies published in seven SSCI (Social Science Citation Index) journals of educational technology by referring to the technology-based learning model. The review results showed that concept maps mostly played the role of a personal Mindtool and a collaborative Mindtool, and were mainly applied in elementary schools. The majority of elementary school teachers employed concept maps as a collaborative Mindtool (for a learning group), a personal Mindtool (for individual students), and a learning design tool. As for secondary school teachers, concept maps were mostly adopted as an assessment and evaluation tool, personal Mindtools, and collaborative Mindtools. In terms of application issues, the most adopted medium was desk-top computers, and the most adopted application domains were science, engineering, and language. The research focus explored the most in CM-K12 research was cognition, followed by affect and learning behavior. Based on the findings, several recommendations are proposed."

        "Teachers often consider modern active teaching methods to be better suited for students who are good at learning or even for gifted students, as they assume that students with learning disabilities have underdeveloped metacognitive and social learning skills, that they require more time to grasp the techniques of the more advanced, technology aided teaching methods and that they cannot acquire additional knowledge at the same time. Our research focuses on pupils with learning disabilities, their attitude towards learning and teaching with the help of ICT and on motivation that arises from it. The study has shown that students with learning disabilities are confident enough in their computer skills that teachers may freely use modern teaching methods with them in primary school, as even those children are motivated and have a good attitude towards such teaching methods."

        "We have previously proven that educational technology can be used to improve the student performance in mathematics learning significantly. In a two-year study, an educational tool called ViLLE was utilized in elementary school mathematics education by replacing one lesson a week with a ViLLE lesson, where the students solved automatically assessed mathematics exercises and played educational math games. Still, although the results in relation to the student performance and motivation have proven to be very good, we have not previously collected systematic feedback from the teachers utilizing the tool. In this paper, we present an analysis of feedback collected with a comprehensive survey on teachers' opinions and attitudes towards utilizing educational technology in mathematics education is analyzed. More than 50 educators who teach lower level elementary school mathematics and use the ViLLE tool answered the survey. Based on the analysis of the answers, the teachers seem to be very satisfied with the automatically assessed mathematics exercises, and are keen to use them in the future as well. We also analyze teachers' opinions on the effectiveness and usability of the tool, the difficulty level of the exercises and the need for on-classroom support when using the tool. Finally, we present some possible changes to be made on the tool and the exercises based on teachers' feedback and comments."

The COVID-19 lockdown and shift to emergency remote teaching and learning raised a number of questions for architectural education. These relate to access, equity and pedagogical approaches, which emerged through this study. The paper presents the findings of the study carried out in the University of Rwanda, and Uganda Martyrs University, along with the implications of the findings for architectural education. Making use of an online questionnaire distributed via QualtricsXM, the study attracted 70 student participants. The paper concludes with some suggestions for architectural educators as they rethink the embedded pedagogical traditions of architectural education, and how these must adapt for the future in order to cope with future shocks and disruptions."

        "This article gives an account of what is happening nowadays in the intersection of education and technology. It aims to offer an overview that starts not in the present but in the past so that we become aware of how more often than not we are trapped in political rhetoric and capitalistic discourses. Headings in newspapers from 1963 read, \"Crowded schools. Overworked teachers. In today's education turmoil, can your child obtain the personalized teaching that every child, average or advanced, need?\" and for that problem the solution proposed was technological, hence, little has changed in relation to the crowded schools and overworked teachers. I then scrutinise the present through the invasion of platforms and the accompanying Silicon Valley discourse about universal solutions to education concluding that the situation does not look very different than at the beginning of the 20th century. The future is illustrated using my own research giving an account of my sociological oriented approach to educational research in the field. Critical realism and realist social theory are described briefly and proposed as a theoretical framework to think about these issues in a less deterministic way, giving its due importance to the local. It offers a theory-driven approach to a methodology that thinks about how to capture the daily entanglements of students with open and participatory digital tools in the context of their studies looking at uncovering the invisible thus hidden structures that operate as constraints for students' agency in their digital practice."

        "The concept of \"play\" as a powerful agent for learning has been regarded by a wide range of educators as the modern Trojan horse for 21st century schools. Allowed to enter the classroom under the guise of education, does this game playing lead to better teaching and learning or is it a harmful panacea for poor teaching? With the increased use of educational technology components in both face-to-face and virtual classrooms, this discussion has recently focused on the role of interactive multimedia learning environments as settings of \"play.\" At Sultan Qaboos University in Oman, a Master's level course offered by the Instructional and Learning Technologies Department in the College of Education began using games to explore play learning and its potential educational value. For this course, students were provided with theories of gaming and play with respect to education. The discussion naturally extended to consider the wider context of Omani society and the potential relationship with traditional values. The students were supplied with free, user-friendly, online tools to \"get their feet wet\" as users and then were provided more complex, interactive game experiences. During this time, students also produced their own designed webquest games incorporating game play practices into the product. This work-in-progress investigation explores the construct of play through a pilot study integrating games-based learning into an existing Masters students' course curriculum during the spring semester of 2014. The audience is invited to share in these experiences with the respectful attention to culture and tradition. The presentation concludes with some initial patterns beginning to emerge from the analysis and thoughts on the intrinsic value of play and potential opportunities for future developments of games to meet a global audience."

        "With the change of the international situation, international exchanges are increasingly close. Not only the political, economic and cultural exchanges between China and Russia are increasingly frequent, but also the educational cooperation between China and Russia is increasingly close. Information technology is a communication and multimedia technology composed of computer, data, network and other tools. With the continuous development of the times, human beings have entered the information age. Educational informationization is the inevitable trend of educational development, which will bring about great changes in educational models and methods. Objectives: in today's highly developed information exchange, within the framework of China's \"belt and road\" initiative, we should make effective use of the educational information resources of China and Russia, seek cooperation between the two countries in foreign language education in colleges and universities, especially in online education, so as to make better use of modern educational technology and cultivate excellent compound talents with comprehensive language ability for the society, to meet diversified social needs and benefit the society. Results: by comparing and analyzing the educational technology of Chinese and Russian universities, this paper summarizes the advantages of foreign language education of the two countries, and looks for the way of cooperation in foreign language education of the two countries, especially in the field of online education. In terms of foreign language teaching, colleges and universities of the two countries can form a multi-level online education system based on the macro guidance of the government, the operation and development of relevant platforms supported by enterprises and supervision, and the micro support of online education resources provided by colleges and universities."

        "The significance of the outlined direction research is determined by the fact that in modern conditions of postmodern society development, the issues of improving higher education and ensuring the quality of the educational process become relevant. The need for innovative renewal of the educational process of the higher school is determined by the emergence of a number of psychological and pedagogical problems, taking into account the conditions of postmodernity(mismatch between the needs of employers, the existing state of future professionals training and scientific and pedagogical staff's qualifications, lack of mechanisms for selective processing of information, insufficient provision of information and psychological security of the individual, the need to develop an inclusive educational environment in higher education, etc.). The main conceptual principles of the innovative development of the educational environment in postmodern conditions are highlighted (humanization of the educational process, providing developmental learning and personality-oriented approach). The article analyzes the foreign and domestic experience of using innovative educational technologies (individualized, personality-oriented learning, as well as gamification of the future training professionals' process), identifies their advantages and disadvantages. Peculiarities of their introduction into the practice of higher education in postmodern conditions are outlined. Prospects for further research are the development of practical recommendations for the introduction of innovative educational technologies in the future professionals training in higher education."

In addition, computers and related software are used in all professional fields of the workplace; therefore, students should acquire related essential abilities before they enter the workforce. Teachers should devote attention to designing and implementing appropriate online teaching methods and guiding their students to adopt suitable learning strategies to develop related abilities and improve their learning effectiveness. Thus, in this study, two innovative teaching methods, namely self-organized learning (SOL) and learners-as-designers (LaD), were integrated with educational technology and ubiquitous learning (u-learning) to develop students' computing skills, academic motivation, and engagement in a blended course. A quasi-experiment was conducted to examine the effects of ubiquitous SOL and LaD. The experiment used a 2 (SOL vs. non-SOL) x 2 (LaD vs. non-LaD) factorial pretest-posttest design. First-year students from four classes who were taking a one-semester university course titled \"Applied Information Technology: Data Processing\" were the participants in the empirical study. The results revealed that students who received the ubiquitous LaD intervention exhibited significantly improved computing skills compared with those of students who did not receive the intervention. However, the ubiquitous SOL intervention did not enhance students' computing skills, academic motivation, or engagement. The study results may be used as references for online educators when designing an online, cloud, or ubiquitous course for their students."

        "The studies about literacy have pointed to the necessity of reconsidering the ontology and paradigms that are related to the comprehension of several literacy practices, their relationship with the subject in the contemporary society as in the case of the practice that involve technologies and digital resources in scholar environments. Thus, aiming to investigate how the digital literacy has been introduced in the teaching of languages, in the scope of basic education, a survey in a public school was conducted. Such survey was a case study in which the relationship between different conditional contexts of digital literacy insertion was evaluated like, for example, the prescriptive and directive; the infrastructure; the teacher background and, at the end, the practices themselves. The theoretical foundation to conduct this survey relied on the novel studies on literacy ( PAHL & ROWSELL, 2012), the presumptive literacy as social practice ( STREET, 1984, 2003; LANKSHEAR & KNOBEL, 2006, 2011) and the pedagogic proposal of multi- literacy ( CAZDEN et al., 1996; ROJO, 2009, 2012), especially in relation to the conception of digital literacy ( MARTIN, 2008). Summarily, in our present work, we examined two of these cited contexts, namely, the prescriptive/ directive and the practices, from which the analysis has allowed the following aspects to be observed: lack of consonance between these contexts; minimal insertion of the digital literacy in the scholar curriculum; incipient and very punctual insertion of these literacy practices; additionally, these contexts did not take into account the socio- discursive and interactive experiences from the students outside the school."

These proto-ideas are non-formal and informal education and theories of deschooling. These terms recieve a precise treatment in the article, and immediately after that, their relation with the concept and the practices of expanded education are explored. The conclusion reached is that expanded education is different from non-formal and informal education. However, the criticism of schooling can still play a role in it."

        "Introducing educational technology (EdTech) into school classrooms constitutes one of the strongest educational reforms of recent decades worldwide, and as a discursive or ideological background of it, there has been the optimistic consensus on the use of EdTech among the global education community. In this context, this study highlights the dark side of EdTech and provides an opportunity for critical self-reflection of its current use through a series of quantitative analyses on a longitudinal dataset of children in K-3 American classrooms collected during the first half of the 2010s (ECLS-K:2011). In this process, two adverse effects of EdTech on young children's learning achievement are identified: the negative effect and the gap-widening effect. These findings convey the crucial message that the education community's approaches to EdTech should be more prudent than the current optimistic consensus. These findings do not lead us to any extreme or rigid conclusion such as techno-determinism or neo-Luddism, but rather call for a balanced and realistic deliberation on the benefits and risks of technology. This point is particularly worth clarifying in the recent situation, where schools' dependence on EdTech has inevitably increased in response to the COVID-19 pandemic."

There is a lot we know about how people learn, yet very few faculty members are learning experts. There is good evidence that adaptive or personalized learning environments help more students be successful, but these are hard to implement in traditional settings. The use of a competency-based education model can facilitate the use of these new learning environments to benefit students."

        "A major challenge in teaching medicine in a rural setting is that long geographical distances separate students, instructors, and educational resources. Clinical schools within the University of Sydney Medical Program are geographically dispersed and face similar challenges. As a result, a virtual ophthalmology clinic (VOC) was developed (Succar et al., 2013) and it is being delivered online to enable equitable access and consistency in the foundations of ophthalmology education for rural-based students. The program allows students to sharpen their clinical reasoning skills by formulating a diagnosis and treatment plan on virtual patients with simulated conditions. To evaluate the educational effectiveness of VOC, a randomized controlled trial was conducted with the University of Sydney medical students (n = 188). The pre- and post-test and student satisfaction questionnaire were administered. Twelve months later, a follow-up test was conducted to determine the long-term retention rate of graduates. On the basis of a statistically significant improvement in academic performance and highly positive student feedback, it became clear that the online delivery of VOC can serve as a model for higher education institutions creating an all-inclusive learning environment experienced by rural students and staff regardless of location and distance, while making a positive impact on learning."

The overarching research question was: How has the participation of an ETL master's candidate in an e-portfolio process contributed to the implementation of e-portfolio practices with PK-12 students? A mixed methods, explanatory sequential design, sometimes referred to as a two-phase model [1], was the methodology selected for this study. The researchers captured quantitative survey data via Survey Monkey T from 289 ETL Master's graduates in the first phase, and then qualitative data in the second phase which included examining 60 masters' graduate electronic portfolios. The graduates' writing and e-portfolio elements were analyzed to obtain individual viewpoints and perceptions about Web 2.0 tools as a component of an e-portfolio. Also, qualitative data was collected from open-ended questions through feedback sessions with ETL graduates about early implementation of electronic portfolios in PK-12 school settings. The quantitative survey data results indicated the research population supported the use of digital portfolios for assessment. The qualitative data analysis revealed that candidates value the use of electronic portfolios to support learning and assessment. The identified stages of implementation and barriers described by Barrett [2] were evident in candidates' responses."

        "Educators have recommended that the affordances provided by ICTs should be used to promote student-centered constructivist learning. While the actual use of ICT in education has increased, not much change has occurred in terms of the pedagogical practices followed. Information transmission models of teaching are still being followed, albeit with the use of ICT. Efforts at the school level attempt to address this problem via teacher education programs that emphasize ICT integration with constructivist practices. In higher education settings, there are fewer reported studies on ICT integration at a systemic level, and most decisions related to the use of ICTs are left to the instructor. In this paper, we describe the design, implementation and evaluation of ET4ET, a large-scale faculty professional development program (1138 participants) on effective integration of educational technology for engineering college instructors in India. Guided by the Attain-Align-Integrate (A2I) model, the ET4ET program prepares instructors to implement ICT supported student-centric teaching strategies. To ensure engagement and learning of the participants, active learning strategies are implemented throughout the ET4ET program. This paper traces the development of ET4ET, from a small-scale face-to-face implementation to a large-scale mode mediated by technology, and suggests guidelines for similar training programs."

However, to date the majority of studies in the context of education have predominantly focused on University students. This paper explores how gamifieation could potentially benefit a specific student population, children with dyslexia who are transitioning from primary to secondary school. Two teachers from specialist dyslexia teaching centres used classDojo, a gamification platform, during their teaching sessions for one term. We detail how the teachers appropriated the platfomi in different ways and how the students discussed classDojo in terms of motivation. These findings have subsequently informed a set of provisional implications for gamification distilling opportunities for future pedagogical uses, gamification design for special education and methodological approaches to how gamification is studied."

        "In the post-pandemic era, one of the significant challenges for anatomy teachers is to reciprocate the experience of practical exposure while teaching the subject to undergraduates. These challenges span from conducting cadaveric dissections to handling real human bones, museum specimens, and tissue sections in the histology lab. Such exposures help the instructors to develop interactive communication with their fellow students and thus help to enhance communication skills among them. Recently, anatomy teachers all over the world started using cutting-edge educational technologies to make teaching-learning experiences for students more engaging, interesting, and interactive. Utilizing such cutting-edge educational technologies was an \"option\" prior to the pandemic, but the pandemic has significantly altered the situation. What was previously an \"option\" is now a \"compulsion.\" Despite the fact that the majority of medical schools have resumed their regular on-campus classes, body donation and the availability of cadavers remain extremely limited, resulting in a deadlock. Anatomy teachers must incorporate cutting-edge educational technologies into their teaching and learning activities to make the subject more visual. In this chapter, we have attempted to discuss various new technologies which can provide a near-realistic perception of anatomical structures as a complementary tool for dissection/cadaver, various visualization techniques currently available and explore their importance as a pedagogic alternative in learning anatomy. We also discussed the recent advancement in visualization techniques and the pros and cons of technology-based visualization. This chapter identifies the limitations of technology-based visualization as a supplement and discusses effective utilization as an adjunct to the conventional pedagogical approaches to undergraduate anatomy education."

        "Purpose The purpose of this study is to examine a week-long science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) project-based learning (PBL) activity that integrates a new educational technology and the engineering design process to teach middle and high school students the concepts involved in rotational physics. The technology and teaching method described in this paper can be applied to a wide variety of STEM content areas. Design/methodology/approach As an educational technology, the dynamic and interactive mathematical expressions (DIME) map system automatically generates an interactive, connected concept map of mathematically based concepts extracted from a portable document format textbook chapter. Over five days, students used DIME maps to engage in meaningful self-guided learning within the engineering design process and STEM PBL. Findings Using DIME maps within a STEM PBL activity, students explored the physics behind spinning objects, proposed multiple creative designs and built a variety of spinners to meet specified criteria and constraints. Practical implications STEM teachers can use DIME maps and STEM PBL to support their students in making connections between what they learn in the classroom and real-world scenarios. Social implications For any classroom with computers, tablets or phones and an internet connection, DIME maps are an accessible educational technology that provides an alternative representation of knowledge for learners who are underserved by traditional methods of instruction. Originality/value For STEM teachers and education researchers, the activity described in this paper uses advances in technology (DIME maps and slow-motion video capture on cell phones) and pedagogy (STEM PBL and the engineering design process) to enable students to engage in meaningful learning."

        "The preparation of student teachers to utilise ICT as part of their teaching is a key goal of many teacher education programmes (Valtonen et al, 2015). As Tezci (2011) notes, 'pre-service teachers are the teachers of the future. They are expected to integrate ICT into their future classroom activities' (p. 484). Initiatives targeting ICT adoption have paid particular attention to teachers' attitudes to technology since, as Albirini (2006) reports, a number of studies have shown that positive attitudes towards educational technology are, 'major factors related to both the initial acceptance of computer technology as well as future behaviour regarding computer usage' (p. 374). These studies frequently employ survey instruments to determine these attitudes, however, such approaches do not consider expressed attitudes as acts of compliance or indeed defiance. Neither do they capture the influence of past schooling experiences and issues of power that can influence student teachers' responses. Underpinned by a reflexive understanding of language, this study aimed to explore student teachers' views of educational technology and in doing so examine how student teachers speak about educational technology. Situated within a post-structuralist paradigm and drawing on a discursive psychological framework, this study conducted one-to-one semi-structured interviews with twenty student teachers on entry onto pre-service teacher education master's degree programmes in a Spanish University. The interview explored past ICT schooling experiences, their opinions on educational technology and their future plans to use ICT. The study found that the majority of the student teachers (n=17) experienced some level of ICT usage however this appeared limited almost exclusively to teachers' use in displaying information visually to assist explanations. When subsequently asked about their own views of ICT in teaching and learning most students' expressed a positive attitude, however there were differences in their discourses around it. These discourses ranged from the need to equip students with important life skills, as demanded by an emerging digital society, to those that considered it as a resource to amplify existing teaching practices or enhance student learning. When asked to describe how they planned to use the technology in the future as part of their own teaching, the nature of planned use tended to reflect what they themselves had experienced. The paper argues that the student teachers used the opportunity of the interview to express their allegiance to more traditional teaching practices. We argue that expressing a preference for 'pen and paper' or the 'traditional' blackboard is not necessarily a rejection of ICT but rather a preference for existing practices based on past experiences. As they had only recently enrolled on the programme they did not have the opportunity to explore potential uses of ICT in depth or to have their views of teaching and learning broadened. These interpretations points to the importance of teacher education programmes in both widening their understanding of the ways ICT can be used in education and challenging their initial attitudes towards ICT that they have acquired before entering the programme."

Biesta). My approach to is less optimistic. Instead, it is more in line with Selwyn and Facer's (2013, p. 6) notion of \"critical studies of educational technology,\" where the goal is to \"open the black box of technology\" (p. 10), to expose underlying political and economic logics and dominating narratives where digital technology is used as a \"proxy signifier\" for \"the future\" (p. 11). I carry out a conceptual analysis of digital competence along with its ideological and temporal inclinations. This analysis is influenced by a foucauldian discussion of governance as well as the German historian Reinhart Koselleck's notion of \"conceptual hermeneutics\" and temporal phenomenology, the aim being to decode how the agency of teachers is constructed through a policy-driven and individualistic futurology, based on the neoliberal assumption that educational technology is the solution to current problems in schools (Selwyn, 2016)."

K-12 online course revenue including any digital curriculum increased some 320% and the testing and assessment market, the largest single category, generated $2.5 billion. The New Zealand business organisation EDTechNZ, indicates on its website that educational technology is the fastest growing sector of a global smart education market worth US$100 billion, forecast to grow to US $394 by 2019. The same source indicates that Cloud-based educational technology is accelerating at 20% growth per annum and is forecast to reach US$ 12 billion by 2019. These returns are unequalled by most other economic sectors. Our concern in this article is that the market imperative based on selling has become a driving logic for digital technologies in schools while learning gets lost in the rush for companies to profit from schools, creating de facto privatisation by stealth. Aspects of the New Zealand educational context are used to illustrate our thinking, especially since most educational provision is still state owned and taxpayer funded."

        "This study explores educational technology infusion in the U.S. school district context. We used a complex systems perspective to understand the interactions between the classroom (micro), building (meso), and organization (macro) system levels of a school district, offering insight into how and why certain permutations of tools, content, and practices are effective and impactful. We used comparative case study methods to understand (a) patterns in teachers' implementation of digital technologies in early elementary classrooms and (b) the organizational system that influences those patterns in one small school district serving a mixed suburban/rural community. Data were collected over 12 months, and included: elementary classroom observations, interviews with principals and district leaders, and student performance data. Our findings trace activities within and connections across levels of a district organization undergoing technology infusion. We found that district administration established human-centered leadership practices to facilitate instructional technology integration and principals maintained this leadership ethos in variable ways. Teachers leveraged technology for personalization and collaborative learning, and used robust classroom management routines to anchor complex instruction with young children. The findings highlight key considerations for system leaders, technologists, and policymakers; in particular, establishing a professional culture that offers widespread support for instructional experimentation."

These transformations. with reinvented principles, lead us to draw other training spaces and implement certain technologies, such as Augmented Reality (AR), as resources for higher education. This research on the use of AR in the training processes of university students was carried out in two Spanish universities: the University of Seville, in the subject of Educational Technology of the Degree in Pedagogy; and at the University of Barcelona, in the subjects of Theory and Practice of the Inclusive School and Education, School and Attention to Diversity of the Degree in Primary Education. The objectives were: a) to investigate knowledge about this technology; b) to design and produce digital objects in AR (group and individual) and: c) to assess the usefulness of this technology in higher education. A survey was passed to 186 participating students and four discussion groups were held. The results highlight the innovative, interesting and playful nature of AR as a resource in the teaching and learning processes, where students generate a series of skills and become prosumers rather than consumers of their own digital objects. It also highlights the importance of technological and pedagogical training for future education professionals."

        "Background: Recently, policy makers and school leaders have heavily invested in the promise that educational technology could catalyze systemic school change. Yet some critics note that the conversation surrounding technology in schools is a red herring that has not produced clear, definitive, and equitable results across different school settings. In order to address this concern, prior research has mainly focused on understanding how and why teachers use technology. Still, we argue that an understudied third perspective-examining what types of technology-using teachers exist-could provide innovative and impactful insights to shape research, policy, and practice in instructional technology. Purpose of the Study: We investigate the extent to which there is a typology of teachers who use technology, as well as to what extent school- and teacher-level variables predict membership in the different subgroups in the typology, by an a nationally generalizable sample (2,764 teachers) from the Teachers' Use of Educational Technology in G.S. Public Schools, 2009 Fast Response Survey System dataset, collected by the National Center for Education Statistics. Research Design: We used a three-step, one-level latent class analysis (LCA) with nationally generalizable data that identify significantly different types of technology-using teachers, as well as what covariates predict membership in the identified subgroups. Findings: We find that there are four statistically .significant subgroups of technology-using teachers: Dexterous (24.4%), Evaders (22.2%), Assessors (28.4%), and Presenters (24.8%). We also find that several covariates, such as student socioeconomic status, school type, enrollment, years of teacher experience, and total number of school computers, predicted teachers' membership in these four subgroups of technology using teachers. Conclusions: Our findings reiterate the notion that technology-using teachers are not a monolithic group or are randomly distributed across school settings, finding that low-income schools are more likely to have teachers who use technology in less meaningful ways. As a quantitative phenomenology, this study provides one of the first empirically based, nationally generalizable depictions of technology use in schools, which could inform school leaders and policy makers as they evaluate new digital tools, design professional learning for teachers, and tackle inequalities in technology access, teacher knowledge, and technology-mediated learning experiences and outcomes for students."

        "This article reveals the modern goal of teaching a foreign language in a globalizing multicultural society. The goal is not just mastering the communicative skills of speech activity in a foreign language, but developing the readiness and ability of the learner's personality to interact with representatives of the international community, using a foreign language as a means of communication. The necessity of making adjustments to the organization of teaching a foreign language in higher education and developing new effective educational technologies taking into account the whole complex of factors of the modern socio-cultural and educational situation and the synergy of the language personality, language and environment is substantiated. The main part of the paper is devoted to the description of the author's cognitive-discursive teaching technology and its didactic potential in teaching intercultural communication. The conceptual basis of cognitive-discursive technology is the reliance on the scientific concept of an integrated cognitive-discursive approach to the formation of a foreign-language intercultural competence that represents a set of provisions, each of which determines the essence of educational activity. It manifests itself in the choice of the dominant method of mastering the means of foreign language activity, which changes the nature of instruction: a) enlarged and socioculturally-enriched didactic units are introduced in the content of instruction (discourse, frame, concept); b) new ways of mastering the means of foreign speech activity, contributing to a deep awareness of other cultural phenomena, adequacy of perception, understanding and interpretation of a foreign language communication are implemented; c) strategies for managing cognitive activities are formed; d) interpersonal and intercultural communication is strengthened and developed; e) the reciprocal links in the \"teacher-student-subject of intercultural communication\" system are updated. Conditions are created for the realization of the intercultural orientation, systematic consideration of nature and the essence of language as a means of intercultural communication and the realization of an educational process in which learners disclose for themselves the phenomenon of language in all necessary completeness, depth and sociocultural determination. The teaching method based on cognitive-discursive technology includes a set of tasks and exercises that is consistent with a step-by-step implementation of the cognitive-discursive activity of students and the teacher, contributing to the gradual accumulation of information on foreign-language discourse among students, their awareness of their actions to achieve its understanding and to master intercultural-communicative and cognitive-discursive activity, which determines the ability to intercultural communication. This educational technology developed by the author seems to be an innovative tool of the transformative teacher's activity, contributing to the creation of favorable organizational and methodological conditions in which the learner is involved in active cognitive-discursive activity."

Teacher training study programs at universities of Slovak Republic include subjects that prepare students to master modern learning technologies, and guide them how to use ICT and other digital technologies in teaching practice. At the same time, they not only serve digital devices and effectively use standard didactic software, but learn how to create their own applications and gain practical experience. Not only in the study program of secondary school teacher but also in the study program of students in the field of pre-school and elementary education there are several subjects that are aimed at acquiring theoretical knowledge and practical skills necessary for successful integration of ICT in education. These subjects also prepare future teachers to evaluate the use of each technology tool for the chosen thematic unit, with the learning objectives to be achieved. These subjects create space for students to learn about current trends in educational technologies and thus to complement and expand their knowledge in modern pedagogy. During the course, the future teachers will not only acquire the necessary theoretical knowledge and practical experience in using hardware and software, but will also acquire sufficient skills to create complete didactic applications. In order to correctly determine the content of this subjects, we examined the technical equipment of schools, what kind of didactic software are available to teachers, what kind of educational software teachers generally use and if teachers are able to create their own didactic software applications. We were interested in what resources and environments they use to create educational applications. Exploration, we used questionnaire methods and for the evaluation of the questionnaires we used methods of descriptive statistics."

It is necessary to set up a system of education in accordance with the time and conditions by utilizing the most important tools of development and promotion namely new educational technologies, increasing awareness and improving the human capital capability and training of expert and committed staff and taking steps in the sustainable development, effective modernity and efficiency highway in order to overcome the traditional and old structures, enter the scientific competition field, overcoming the challenges and achieving the optimum ideals of the society but how much has the primary schools of Qavar city been able to play the role of modern technology in its educational system? At first, the research method was library method and then it was a qualitative method. Data were collected by a semi-structured interview and then they were analyzed by theme analysis method. Findings of the first part of this research suggest that use of technology has been effective in changing attitude, acquisition of skills and enhancement of teachers' empowerment and academic achievement, attractive learning and increasing creative thinking of learners. The findings of 9 interviews showed that the following three factors (in order of importance) have significantly reduced the rate of technology utilization in the primary schools of Qavar city. 1 - Unfamiliarity or not having enough teachers' proficiency in technology and its usage in teaching 2 - a large number of students and lack of facilities 3 - bulky textbooks and not having sufficient time."

The second goal was to design workshops to test and analyse the possible educational uses of videogames. The data show that the majority define themselves as videogames users and that there does not appear to be any significant difference between players and non-players. In the second part of the study, we tested four workshops or experiments. The sessions have shown that the electronic games can be interesting support material at the schools, and that the motivation of the students is very high in this kind of proposals."

        "Technology companies are investing billions of dollars in educational technology, but also creating their own alternative schools. This article traces the emergence of four prototypical silicon startup schools' as exemplars of a technocratic mode of corporatized education reform: IBM's P-TECH, part of its Smarter Cities program; AltSchool, a chain of schools based on makerspaces' established by a former Google executive; Kahn Lab School, a new 'experimental' school launched by the founder of the online Kahn Academy; and XQ Super School Project, a 'crowdsourcing' project to redesign American high schools funded philanthropically by the wife of Steve Jobs of Apple. Startup schools are analysed as prototype educational institutions that originate in the culture, discourse and ideals of Silicon Valley venture capital and startup culture, and that are intended to relocate its practices to the whole social, technical, political and economic infrastructure of schooling. These new schools are being designed as scalable technical platforms; funded by commercial 'venture philanthropy' sources; and staffed and managed by executives and engineers from some of Silicon Valley's most successful startups and web companies. Together, they constitute a powerful shared 'algorithmic imaginary' that seeks to 'disrupt' public schooling through the technocratic expertise of Silicon Valley venture philanthropists."

        "The purpose of this oral presentation and paper is to share the process and outcomes of an international collaboration exploring the futurology of educational technology. This multi-phased collaboration centers on envisioning the impacts of future technologies within the classroom and articulating resultant implications for teacher professional development. It leverages interdisciplinary knowledge and expertise from within and beyond educational colleges in partner universities, namely, the Mary Lou Fulton Teachers College in Arizona State University, United States of America, and the Institute of Education in Dublin City University, Ireland. A question at the heart of this collaborative study was how can we prepare the teachers of tomorrow to use technology in the classroom in the most effective way possible? Given the rapid development of technology and the subsequent adoption in formal and informal educational settings, how can we prepare a new generation of educators to adopt, and optimize technologies in their classroom? According to the 2017 New Horizons K-12 Report, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT) will be generally adopted by 2022 [1]. Artificial Intelligence is often thought of the \"next wave\" of technology, but our goal is to move beyond the near future, and look to what will be the \"new\" technology 25 to 30 years from now. Using the forecast of common \"narrow\" AI implementations across classrooms within five years as the baseline for our model, we aim to envision what technologies will have an influence on, and be implemented within, learning ecologies over the next several decades, an era we describe as the 'Diamond Age'. This paper will discuss the need for such a collaborative project, the current development of the multi-phased, multi-year project scope, as well as the future directions and joint-program goals. In many cases, the education sector handles new and emerging technology in a reactionary fashion. One of the aims of this collaborative project is to look at educational technology from a futurist perspective to lay a thought provoking foundational model in order to redefine what education may look like in the \"classroom of tomorrow\". The intended goal of this futurist model of educational technology is to reconceptualize how teacher preparation programs think about preparing future educators."

        "Technological advancement has revolutionized teaching and learning in the twenty-first century. However, the full benefits are yet to be realized and clearly understood due to user experience data paucity, especially in developing countries. This study delves into the issue from both the demand and supply perspectives. The demand-side analysis interrogated students' perceptions of the tonic and toxic facets of using the Sakai/Moodle learning management system, while supply-side analysis explored the perceived roles of university lecturers and university authorities in embedding this new culture in Ghana. Using a mixed-methods approach, two universities in Ghana were selected to serve as focal organizations. Long interviews with graduate students provided the qualitative data, while a survey of under-graduate students yielded the quantitative data. Triangulation revealed that despite nascent challenges, students found LMS to be useful in learning, and that lecturers and school authorities played pivotal roles in routinizing learning management systems (LMS) in Ghana. Mode of study, students' gender, age and perceptions of the advantages and disadvantages of using ICT for teaching and learning as well as the role of lecturers and university authorities in enhancing the quality and sustainable use of LMS for teaching and learning in Ghana were found. The findings suggest that universities stand to benefit from the adoption and use of educational technologies for teaching and learning. Universities ought to consider the varied cognitions, affect and perspectives of students on teaching and learning technologies, when designing relevant policies that support the employment of ICT-enabled educational practice."

        "Due to economic issues, many school budgets are extremely strained by just the basic necessities of an educational institution. These budget limitations inhibit access to educational technologies that may promote engineering principle development within K-12 classrooms. PaperBots is a product that focuses on overcoming budget-driven limitations by utilizing materials like paper, office, and craft supplies already accounted for in a school's budget. By effectively providing activities promoting abstract, design-based thinking and creativity in the classroom like other products in the educational technology marketplace, such as LEGO Mindstorms but at a much lower cost, PaperBots can be utilized by many budget constricted schools. Through combination of those available materials with inexpensive electronics and an Arduino based control unit known as the PaperBots Robotics Kit, students can be challenged with interesting and entertaining engineering activities in the classroom. In October of 2012, a small focus group of fifteen fifth- and sixth-grade students assembled for a workshop utilizing the PaperBots robotics kit. This activity was observed and documented to make a qualitative determination of the effectiveness of this product."

        "Evidence from various domains underlines the key role that human factors, and especially, trust, play in the adoption of technology by practitioners. In the case of Artificial Intelligence (AI) driven learning analytics tools, the issue is even more complex due to practitioners' AI-specific misconceptions, myths, and fears (i.e., mass unemployment and ethical concerns). In recent years, artificial intelligence has been introduced increasingly into K-12 education. However, little research has been conducted on the trust and attitudes of K-12 teachers regarding the use and adoption of AI-based Educational Technology (EdTech). The present study introduces a new instrument to measure teachers' trust in AI-based EdTech, provides evidence of its internal structure validity, and uses it to portray secondary-level school teachers' attitudes toward AI. First, we explain the instrument items creation process based on our preliminary research and review of existing tools in other domains. Second, using Exploratory Factor Analysis we analyze the results from 132 teachers' input. The results reveal eight factors influencing teachers' trust in adopting AI-based EdTech: Perceived Benefits of AI-based EdTech, AI-based EdTech's Lack of Human Characteristics, AI-based EdTech's Perceived Lack of Transparency, Anxieties Related to Using AI-based EdTech, Selfefficacy in Using AI-based EdTech, Required Shift in Pedagogy to Adopt AI-based EdTech, Preferred Means to Increase Trust in AI-based EdTech, and AI-based EdTech vs Human Advice/Recommendation. Finally, we use the instrument to discuss 132 high-school Biology teachers' responses to the survey items and to what extent they align with the findings from the literature in relevant domains. The contribution of this research is twofold. First, it introduces a reliable instrument to investigate the role of teachers' trust in AI-based EdTech and the factors influencing it. Second, the findings from the teachers' survey can guide creators of teacher professional development courses and policymakers on improving teachers' trust in, and in turn their willingness to adopt, AI-based EdTech in K-12 education."

We explore input substitutability in education by employing a novel randomized controlled trial that varies dosage of computer-assisted learning (CAL) as a substitute for traditional learning through homework. Moving from zero to a low level of CAL, we find positive substitutability of CAL for traditional learning. Moving from a lower to a higher level of CAL, substitutability changes and is either neutral or even negative. The estimates suggest that a blended approach of CAL and traditional learning is optimal. The findings have direct implications for the rapidly expanding use of educational technology worldwide prior to, during, and after the pandemic."

        "Research and development of information and communication technology (ICT)-supported learning for people with disabilities has not received adequate attention. It is also difficult to access research findings and developments in this field. Under the ENABLE Network of ICT Supported Learning for Disabled People (2011-2014) project, an emerging European Union reference point portal for end-users will provide this information for a broad audience. In the design phase of the project idea, the authors of this paper conducted a review of papers indexed in Web of Science to provide a needs assessment and a design template for the project objectives. The results of the search clearly showed that ICT-supported learning for people with special educational needs is in the domain of the educational technology journals, with more papers published in the British Journal of Educational Technology than in any other journal. This paper presents the results of a content analysis of all papers published from 1970 to 2011 in seven educational technology journals indexed in Web of Science. More papers were published from 2006 to 2011 (44.7%) than during any other of five periods examined. Findings in terms of ICT intervention, disability groups, groups of study participants by relationship with ICT, and research design, together with trends in published studies in terms of mainstreaming and inclusion, are presented. The main objective of the study was to identify the level of inclusion through analysis of educational context (special schools [30.51%], mainstream schools [28.81%] and general support for life [40.68%]). Based on content analysis, ICT interventions were classified into the two categories of technical intervention in the pedagogical context (62.71% of all papers published) and technical intervention in the wider context (37.29% of all papers published), with nine paper types identified: papers on ICT access, papers on teaching and learning methods, papers on development and testing of ICT solutions, reviews, assessments, papers on inclusion, papers on behavioural and social development, papers on use of information technology and papers on interaction. Papers were also categorised according to types of disability and according to groups of study participants by relationship with ICT. Published papers were divided into four categories by research design: descriptive (49.15%), developmental (26.27%), experimental (17.8%), and developmental and experimental (6.78%). During the period from 1970 to 2000, papers examined design of learning materials with regard to particular categories of disability and particular accessibility needs, while papers published after 2000 also discussed universal design. Based on the review, the authors of this paper have identified a need for application of universal design principles in research and development of learning environments to provide equal accessibility and inclusive education."

        "The present day society is expected to be paralysed in the absence of technology. As a school or a college is a miniature society, the need of technology in educational sector can never be ignored for many genuine reasons. Educational technology has been in active use for a long time especially in most modern educational institutions. But, the emergence of the novel concept of pedagogy forced pedagogues to think on daily basis regarding innovations, modernization and development of learning-teaching scenario. E-learning provides various opportunities to enhance educational development leading to technological sophistication and finally economic uplift. E-learning can play a critical role in preparing modern teachers equipped with sophisticated/learning tools. It has been noticed that effective implementation of e-learning is not possible without teacher's attitude, readiness and appropriate training. The present paper discusses the importance of training in e-learning for teacher's professional development (in this context: e-training) as part of a pedagogic strategy for successful implementation of e-learning/e-resource and academic achievement. The purpose of this paper is to raise and tackle some of the training issues and components for the in-service teachers for effective utilization of e-resource and achievement of educational objectives. The study will equally benefit the future teachers of English in particular in a way that they will prepare themselves in advance to face similar situation if the need arises. (C) 2013 The Authors.

Through a series of in-depth retrospective interviews with key policy actors (n=20) this paper develops a detailed policy historiography' of this period - shedding light on the complex power relations and interests that underpinned these developments. In particular, the paper highlights the origins of these policy interventions in earlier activities, and examines the negotiations and conflicts between and within the two government departments involved in the mass introduction of computing into the UK school system."

        "In this essay, Philip and Garcia argue that visions of mobile devices in the classroom often draw on assumptions about the inherent interests youth have in these devices, the capability of these interests to transfer from out-of-school contexts to the classroom, and the capacity for these new technologies to equalize the educational playing field. These overly optimistic portrayals minimize the pivotal value of effective teaching and are implicitly or explicitly coupled with political agendas that attempt to increasingly control and regiment the work of teachers. Through discussing student interest and issues of educational technology in urban schools and highlighting the affordances and limitations of the texts, tools, and talk that teachers might facilitate with these devices, the authors offer a teacher-focused perspective that is sorely missing in the contemporary debates about using mobile technologies in schools."

This article reports a case study aimed at exploring students' perceptions towards the use of the Serious Game Bethe1Challenge supported with gamified classroom activities, used in a high school during pandemic times. To complement this study, interviews, a pre-test and post-test were implemented and analyzed. Although constraints related to the game were discovered, in the end the tests and interviews revealed that the students perceived Bethe1Challenge as an entertaining, fun, and enjoyable game that motivates and improves English learning."

However, few research in educational technology utilize explainable recommendations. We developed an explanation generator using the parameters from Bayesian knowledge tracing models. We used this educational explainable recommendation system to investigate the effects of explanation on the summer vacation assignment for high school students. Comparing the click counts of recommended quizzes with and without explanations, we found that the number of clicks was significantly higher for quizzes with explanations. Furthermore, system usage pattern mining revealed that students can be divided to three clusters- none, steady and late users. In the cluster of steady users, recommended quizzes with explanations were continuously used. These results suggest the effectiveness of an explainable recommendation system in the field of education."

The present study evaluates two new apps (EYT and eFun) for measuring executive functions in children. The results of this study show that children (aged 5-8) enjoy executive function assessment in the form of games on an iPad. However, only one executive function, EYT working memory, showed significant positive correlations with several types of grades (e.g., English and maths) in primary school students. New, self-assessed, child-friendly executive function measurement tools have the potential to provide future possibilities for teachers to integrate information on cognitive ability into student learning plans."

        "There is strong interest for qualifications in educational technology, a field that investigates how new technologies can be effectively matched to addressing learning needs within educational contexts. Students registering for the University of Cape Town Masters' level course on 'Online Learning Design' come from diverse backgrounds and are employed in schools, universities and in business. Typically their roles in designing educational technology interventions represent a significant yet comparatively small part of their jobs. Over the last four years we have developed and adopted this course to the needs of people who, for the most part, are keen to apply learning design skills in their work contexts. The course thus aims to develop learning design thinking and provide practice with a broad range of pedagogic strategies, theories and technology tools. In keeping with design thinking, we used electronic portfolio assessment rather than formal essays, the conventional form of assessment in Masters' level courses. We draw upon the principles of design-based research (The Design-Based Research Collective, 2003) and Engestrom's Activity Theory (2001) in describing the evolving learning context and our design choices. Using data from the 58 students who have attended the course over the past 4 years, we focus on key tensions that have emerged in the use of electronic portfolios to capture the students' learning design thinking as they develop online learning activities and we endeavour to provide feedback on complex design issues. We distinguish between four student groups, which are permutations of students with and without formal educational and technology backgrounds. Students most closely associated with each of these groups tend to respond differently to the curriculum and learning activities. These varying responses have been instructive in identifying aspects of the course requiring redesign and developing a theoretical account of how students best develop 'learning design thinking'."

        "Student response system which allows bi-directional communication between instruction and students is considered as useful educational technology. It increases learners' attention, engagement, motivation, and achievement through constant interaction and immediate feedback. The purpose of the study is to assess the quantitative results of the previous studies concerning with the effectiveness of SRSs in cognitive and non-cognitive learning outcomes. Therefore, this study applies meta-analysis technique to synthesize the overall result and explains the controversial findings among the previously published studies. During the systematic review procedure, PRISMA checklist has been taken as a guideline. Initial data search yielded 12,605 articles from diverse databases. 142 raw data derived from 68 studies met the inclusion criteria of the meta-analysis; therefore, the analysis has been conducted with 142 independent effect sizes extracted from 68 articles. The meta-analysis yielded that SRS use has statistically significant small effect (i.e., combined effect size: Hedges' g = 0.47, k = 109, p < 0.001) on cognitive learning outcome whereas statistically significant medium effect (i.e., combined effect size: Hedges' g = 0.66, k = 33, p < 0.001) on non-cognitive learning outcome. Further moderator analyses provided evidence for the followings; (1) SRS use in K-12 is more effective than use in higher education, (2) use of SRS in some subject areas is more effective than in others, (3) some SRSs (i.e., Kahoot!) are more effective than others (i.e., Clicker). The meaning of the results was interpreted and discussed within the scope of reviewed literature."

Instructional design is the systematic process of planning and developing learning environments, such as courses, curricula, or educational software. The researcher utilized an Indigenous approach to autoethnography as methodology to establish the community as the norm by which to critique the practices of the instructional designerthe researcher herself. The study findings culminated in the Star Quilt Framework for Culturally Competent Instructional Design, a relational person model for practice that incorporates the role of the instructional designer as an actor in the design process."

Methods: Survey of total 155 medical students about the usage of the electronic devices for studying during the first year of medical school was done. The answers were matched with their exam scores in the first year. Results: Most of students were using a device, as a learning tool and the most important purpose of it was its convenience, especially for taking notes during lectures. However, students who didn't use a device when they learned anatomy or who studied with the printouts showed a tendency of receiving better scores on exams. Conclusion: Utilizing electronic devices for studying tends to be more convenient, but not effective for studying anatomy."

The digital learning path in ViLLE is a pedagogic methodology of utilizing educational technology effectively in classroom: with learning path, one mathematics, language or programming lesson in a week is transformed into digital learning experience. The learning path in ViLLE is already used in one third of Finnish schools. In this article, we present the results of surveying teachers' perceptions about the usage of learning path, it's pedagogic value and their ideas of improving the environment and the learning experience. 280 teachers answered to the survey. Majority of the teachers were very happy with the environment and more than 95 % of them were willing to use it in the future as well. Still, some critique and suggestions for improvement were also presented. In addition to detailed analysis of the results, we also present possible changes into pedagogy based on these suggestions."

        "Background In recent years, the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in education has increased worldwide. The launch of the ChatGPT-3 posed great challenges for higher education, given its popularity among university students. The present study aimed to analyze the attitudes of university students toward the use of ChatGPTs in their academic activities.Method This study was oriented toward a quantitative approach and had a nonexperimental design. An online survey was administered to the 499 participants.Results The findings of this study revealed a significant association between various factors and attitudes toward the use of the ChatGPT. The higher beta coefficients for responsible use (beta=0.806***), the intention to use frequently (beta=0.509***), and acceptance (beta=0.441***) suggested that these are the strongest predictors of a positive attitude toward ChatGPT. The presence of positive emotions (beta=0.418***) also plays a significant role. Conversely, risk (beta=-0.104**) and boredom (beta=-0.145**) demonstrate a negative yet less decisive influence. These results provide an enhanced understanding of how students perceive and utilize ChatGPTs, supporting a unified theory of user behavior in educational technology contexts.Conclusion Ease of use, intention to use frequently, acceptance, and intention to verify information influenced the behavioral intention to use ChatGPT responsibly. On the one hand, this study provides suggestions for HEIs to improve their educational curricula to take advantage of the potential benefits of AI and contribute to AI literacy."

        "The authors discuss the problem of providing a scientific substantiation of the cognitive technology applied for teaching physics; this technology can be applied both to the face-to-face and distant styles of teaching. The research is relevant as physics courses are filled with numerous abstract concepts. Failure in understanding an abstract concept results in the emerging obstacle in perceiving signs, symbols and terms. The authors suggest reducing this obstacle by applying the teaching technology based on (intra-) inter-subject connections and focused on stimulating targeted independent work. However, in-depth preliminary research is required. The authors have reviewed the definitions of cognition, cognitive psychology and science, cognitive technology and cognitive educational technology. Based on their analysis, they have established that interiorization, according to Lev Vygotsky, calls for established connections between information that enters consciousness and anticipative schemes - intellectual structures that emerged from the previous learning. However, the problem of establishing connections has not been raised or discussed before. The authors supplemented the interiorization process with establishment of connections and described the phenomenon of understanding based on this idea. This brought to light the specific features of didactic solutions in the cognitive theory of teaching. Inclusion of the establishing of connections that depends on the level of mental operations development (especially of analysis, synthesis and generalization) calls for a more specific and detailed definition of cognition. The concept of a semantic transfer was introduced; the specific features of defining cognitive technologies were brought to light; a definition of cognitive educational technology was suggested. The authors propose to include in didactic solutions hierarchic semantic structures of (intra-) inter-subject connections built with the method of semantic structures (Tatyana Gnitetskaya). The authors suggest applying cognitive educational technology in accordance with Howard Gardner's specific features of cognitive research: representation, computer, interdisciplinarity, exclusion of vague concepts, and philosophical problems as fundamentals of the universe. The results described in the article show that a project possesses specific features of cognitive research if the participants of the project are involved in targeted independent activities and the project is aimed at revealing inter-subject connections with the help of semantic structures, at interdisciplinarity, at generalizations that allow connecting the research subject to the world view. An enhanced cognitive efficiency of studying physics is achieved without using new neurotechnologies (neurodevices). A cognitive project can be realized in the context of any teaching mode - online or face-to-face; it can be applied at schools and universities. Organizing team contests within projects in physics can engage even low-level students and encourage them to strive for high performance."

        "Background: Learning technologies are becoming universal in health professional education. Despite the potential philosophical and ideological dissonance between CM and technology, the actual use of learning technologies by CM students is currently unknown. As such, there is a need to explore the prevalence and nature of use of educational technologies by CM students. Methods: A cross-sectional survey examining students' behaviours and attitudes to learning technologies at the Endeavour College of Natural Health. Survey items focused on student demographic and educational background, and their use of technology. Chi-square tests were used to examine bivariate relationships and the characteristics of technology use based on respondents' age were determined using a backward stepwise logistic regression. Results: There were 576 responses to the survey. The majority of respondents reported having a mobile phone (96.2%) or a laptop (85.9%), rather than a desktop computer (24.7%). Of those with phones, 92% had a smart phone. Almost all students access their emails every day (84%). Older students (>35 years old) were found to be more likely to have a desktop computer (OR 1.9) and access LinkedIn (OR 2.95), but were less likely to use an eBook reader (OR 2.63) or Facebook (OR 0.21). Discussion: CM educational institutions need to adapt in relation to teaching and learning due to the changing use of and impact of technologies by more non- traditional students. This study points to the need for further research to explore the values, attitudes and use of technology by faculty in complementary medicine institutions. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd."

        "Digital technology in its various forms is a significant component of our working environment and lifestyles. However, there is a broad difference between using digital technologies in everyday life and employing them in formal education. Digital technologies have largely untapped potential for improving education and fostering students' well-being and inclusion at school. To bring this to fruition, systemic and coordinated actions involving the whole school community are called for. To help schools exploit the full range of opportunities digital technologies offer for learning, the European Commission has designed and implemented a self-reflection tool called SELFIE (Self-reflection on Effective Learning by Fostering Innovation through Educational Technology). Based on the DigCompOrg conceptual framework, SELFIE encompasses key aspects for effectively integrating digital technologies in school policies and practices. The present study investigates how SELFIE can also support the school community to self-reflect about students' well-being and inclusion. In Italy, the SELFIE online questionnaire has been completed by 24,715 students, 5,690 teachers, and 1,507 school leaders, for a total of 31,912 users from 201 schools (at primary, lower secondary, and upper secondary levels) located in 10 different regions. The complementary data we have collected regarding student well-being and inclusion highlight significant differences in the perceptions on this issue reported by students, teachers, and school leaders. These findings have important implications for facilitating successful practices within the whole school community in order to promote students' well-being and inclusion using educational technologies, as well as for planning future actions following a systemic approach."

To do so, forty-three asynchronous interviews, based on an open-ended question, were carried out with students undertaking the Bachelor's Degree in Primary Education Teaching at the Universitat de Valencia and specializing in ICT, during strict home confinement. The analysis shows that the participants did not have an instrumental view of technology as providing a series of solutions for the educational difficulties presented by the pandemic. Instead, they took a broad analytical view of the educational issues and the relevance of digital responses to the COVID-19 education crisis. Through the interviews, a series of alternative solutions to emergency remote education were identified and the participants endorsed an integrated vision of the function of teaching based on digital competence as a training requirement."

        "Although the overall research literature on the application of educational technologies to classroom instruction tends to favor their use over their non-use, these results vary considerably depending on what kind of technology is used, who it is used with and, more importantly, under what circumstances and for what instructional purposes it is used. Relatively recent, but well-developed and powerful methodology of systematic reviews, particularly quantitative syntheses (also known as meta-analyses) is especially suitable for addressing questions of that type by systematically summarizing research evidence in given areas of interest in social sciences. This meta-analysis summarizes data from 674 independent primary studies that compared higher degrees of technology use in the experimental condition with less technology in the control condition, in terms of their effects on student learning outcomes in postsecondary education. The result was an overall average weighted effect size of (g) over bar = 0.27 (k = 879, p <.01), indicating low but significant positive effect of technology integration on learning. The follow-up analyses revealed the influence of educational technology used for cognitive support and blended learning instructional settings designed interaction treatments, and technology integration in teacher training, especially when student-centered pedagogical frameworks are used. These findings are of potentially high interest and applied value for educational practitioners, including teachers and school administrators, as well as for instructional designers and developers of educational software."

        "The concept of education in behavioral orientation is to develop those learning environments that should lead to the desired behavior from students, for which they will be rewarded and therefore motivated to continue to learn. Meanwhile, the school environment must be well organized, the class space should represent the world of their problems, the curriculum should be based on behavioral objectives and obtaining knowledge should be based on the use of scientific methods. The teacher becomes the manager of the intellectual and social learning of the students. (Reed and Bergemann, 1992). Although mentioned in the behavioral paradigm, the personalized system of instruction is consistent with the principles of constructivism, being a student-centered. It was initially designed as a training method to improve student performance, replacing the traditional \"punishment\" in education with the use of positive consequences of learning to promote content mastery and increased interpersonal communication (Grant and Spencer, 2003; Fox, 2004). In many respects, this personalized training system based on the learner's pace and focused on deepening content was consistent with well-established educational practices due to changes imposed on them. The teacher is no longer the main actor but he/she is transformed into a manager of learning, planning and organization become more important and the academic progress is determined by student performance and not by the result of a specific calendar (Fox, 2004). The learning material ought to be fragmented into units or modules, each of which having a set of specific behavioral objectives taught in that unit. The five features of the system are represented by (Driscoll, 1994; Grant and Spencer, 2003) emphasizing individual study, knowledge / mastery of the unit requirements, keeping pace individually, using supervisors / tutors to supplement training techniques. Interest in models such as the personalized training system continues to increase in distance education which provides teaching and learning platforms that require such alternatives, and the development of educational technology is another factor that facilitates the implementation of those systems."

Using hierarchical linear modeling to analyze longitudinal survey and achievement data, the authors found that Technology Immersion had a positive effect on students' technology proficiency and the frequency of their technology-based class activities and small-group interactions. Disciplinary actions declined, but treatment students attended school somewhat less regularly than control students. There was no statistically significant immersion effect on students' reading or mathematics achievement, but the direction of predicted effects was consistently positive and was replicated across student cohorts."

        "Laboratory cadaver dissection is essential for three-dimensional understanding of anatomical structures and variability, but there are many challenges to teaching gross anatomy in medical and dental schools, including alack of available space and qualified anatomy faculty. The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy of high-definition audiovisual educational technology in the gross anatomy laboratory in improving dental students' learning outcomes and satisfaction. Exam scores were compared for two classes of first-year students at one U.S. dental school: 2012-13 (no audiovisual technology) and 2013-14 (audiovisual technology), and section exams were used to compare differences between semesters. Additionally, an online survey was used to assess the satisfaction of students who used the technology. All 284 first-year students in the two years (2012-13 N=144; 2013-14 N=140) participated in the exams. Of the 140 students in the 2013-14 class, 63 completed the survey (45% response rate). The results showed that those students who used the technology had higher scores on the laboratory exams than those who did not use it, and students in the winter semester scored higher (90.17 +/- 0.56) than in the fall semester (82.10 +/- 0.68). More than 87% of those surveyed strongly agreed or agreed that the audiovisual devices represented anatomical structures clearly in the gross anatomy laboratory. These students reported an improved experience in learning and understanding anatomical structures, found the laboratory to be less overwhelming, and said they were better able to follow dissection instructions and understand details of anatomical structures with the new technology. Based on these results, the study concluded that the ability to provide the students a clear view of anatomical structures and high-quality imaging had improved their learning experience."

The objective is to analyze how high school students from a state public school in the city of Curitiba, develop the learning of historical knowledge. The teaching and learning process is epistemologically based on Rusen's conception of the construction of historical knowledge (1993, 2001, 2006, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2015). The research methodology is a qualitative approach in which the data were recorded through the research notes. The analyzes contain elements that historical knowledge is elaborated by students in a collaborative and cooperative way, mediated by the context of life, by the teacher's interventions and facilitated by digital technologies. Students understand that the insertion of digital technological resources helps in literacy and in the construction of historical knowledge."

To this specific article, we focus in a reflection starting from a activity which has took place at Escola Estadual Julio de Castilhos in Porto Alegre with students of the first year of high school, connecting History and Patrimonial Education. Debating the school's memories, we noticed that the students distance themselves from the institucion's canonical memories, seeing themselves in a parallel History - that is not inserted in the canonical - and they get close to discourses and to representations that put them as nondisciplined subjects by comparing them to the former school's students, seen as disciplined, actives and politically well-engaged."

        "This article argues that the influx of media technologies into schools between 1900 and 1930 was facilitated by an emergent technoutopian rhetoric in American culture that placed new social value on the acquisition of virtual and worldly experience. Against a backdrop of rising immigration, global visual culture, and American intervention in foreign affairs, the burgeoning educational technology industry-including producers of stereographs, slides, and National Geographic magazine-made inroads into schools by endowing technology with the capacity to \"bring the world to the pupil\" and serve as a substitute for travel. Aligning with progressive reformers, boosters of early educational technology highlighted these products as tools for teaching ambiguous ideals of citizenship that emphasized the simultaneous cultivation of international understanding and loyal patriotism among youth. This article thus provides a critical historical perspective for present-day discussions about the importance of global citizenship and mediated learning in an age of ubiquitous technology and globalization.

The American Association of Colleges of Nursing formed the Faculty Policy Think Tank (FPTT) in 2015, which developed recommendations about health policy curriculum at all levels of nursing education including the DNP. Problem: Prior to the FPTT recommendations, there were no standardized examples of health policy competencies and their evaluation. Approach: A DNP health policy course was redesigned based on the WIT recommendations. Technological capabilities were leveraged to provide an active and experiential learning environment integrating the concepts of cultural competence, health equity, and social awareness. Outcomes: At the conclusion of the course, DNP students are actively engaged in health policy and have increased confidence in their advocacy abilities. Conclusions: Providing DNP students with an experiential, technologically driven learning platform gives students practical tools and applications they can use beyond the classroom to influence health policy."

In this research the use of Facebook is analyzed by university students in relation to learning and university work, and probed whether the student would welcome the inclusion of teachers to that tool in the university classroom. From a quantitative approach, it appears that Facebook is a reality applied to the classroom in Spain as well as activities such groups created with academic goal, sharing links about content of an academic nature or even the answer surveys peers recognized. On the use of Facebook by teachers, most students are favorable."

        "The term \"technology\" is often used to describe our time in the twenty-first century. We can't imagine our lives without technology. Thanks to technological advancements, students no longer have to travel large distances to get education. Almost every business has been impacted by technology, and education is no exception. It's a kind of learning in which a group of people's knowledge, talents, and habits are handed down via teaching, training, and study. The role of educational technology in the classroom has never been more critical than it is now due to the extensive usage of information and communication technologies (ICT). The systematic use of contemporary technology to improve educational results is known as educational technology. Education design, implementation, and evaluation are all facilitated by this technique, which may be used to develop new educational practises or to support the implementation of existing ones. According to earlier descriptions, the research looks at how technology has expanded from a single medium to serve a variety of educational purposes. Increasing numbers of young people are being swayed by the allure of information and communication technologies. Schools have to adapt to suit the needs of today's students since they begin using digital technology at a young age. The use of information technology is now essential in every field. With the help of computers and the Internet, we have unlimited options and resources to improve our work performance. To be successful in today's educational environment, teachers and students alike need the ability to use computers and related technology, which necessitates the acquisition of necessary computer skills and equipment. Instead of resisting change, educators should embrace new technology to enhance the quality of their lessons and make them more interesting to students. Educators and kids alike will benefit from increased reliance on modern technologies. Using and integrating technology in the classroom requires considerable planning on the part of the instructors. The quantity of computers accessible is a major factor in determining how technology may be used in education."

One ICT often cited for its benefits to education is that of the Tablet computer (PC). In this paper we explore the affordances of tablet PCs, as well as the factors which positively contribute to the uptake of tablet PCs within educational settings. Furthermore, we discuss the importance of educator knowledge through the lens of Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) in successfully integrating the use of technology into teaching and learning; research tells us that there can only be meaningful and skilled teaching with technology if pedagogical knowledge, content knowledge and technological knowledge are well defined. As Toyama said, \"there are no technology shortcuts to good education\"."

In the first iterative cycle, this model was validated by 8 experts and implemented by 13 public school teachers from Bogota-Colombia. The second cycle was validated and implemented by 25 teachers. A univariate statistical analysis was used to describe the samples in each cycle as well as content analysis to determine the different components of the model. The model is composed of four conditioning factors: motivation, infrastructure, ICT competencies and perceived usefulness; four principles: teacher reflection, pedagogical flexibility, dialogical communication and roles; two recommendations: temporality of the phases and peer-to-peer work and six phases: initial reflection, context analysis, pedagogical foundation, didactic application, implementation and finally evaluation."

Creative competence empowers people to achieve different solutions to the same problem: in this article an educational activity designed to stimulate creative competence is proposed, in which accessible and low cost technologies are used for custom design of an articulated object, where students can choose between various options for achieving the goal. The results of a pilot project conducted with a group of 44 university students show that activities with digital editing tools and three-dimensional printing are valid for the development of creative competence."

Specifically, learning outcomes and student representation use are compared between eight secondary classrooms utilizing The Connected Chemistry Curriculum and eight secondary chemistry using lecture-based methods. Results from the quasi-experimental intervention indicate that the curriculum and accompanying visualization tool yield only small to modest gains in student achievement on summative assessments. Analysis of student representation use on pre- and post-assessments, however, indicate the students in Connected Chemistry classrooms are significantly more likely to use submicroscopic representations of chemical systems that are consistent with teacher and expert representation use. The affordances of visualization tools in inquiry activities to improve students' representational competence and conceptual understanding of content in the science classroom are discussed.

        "Introduction: Hypertension can cause functional and structural changes in organs such as the brain, heart, blood vessels and kidneys if not treated properly and correctly. In this perspective, the use of educational technologies can be a tool to promote a teaching-learning process through Blended E-Learning (teaching classroom associated with the virtual learning environment \"E-Care of Hipertension\"). Objective: To describe the use of \"E-Care of Hipertension\" in the Blended E-Learning modality to hypertensive patients. Method: A descriptive study composed of 14 patients using the digital educational resource \"E-Care of Hipertension\" every 20 days for 4 months (120 days). At each nursing appointment, blood pressure, weight, waistcircumference and portal access was ratified with the presence of the nurse together with the patient, thus promoting embracement, reflections and contextualization about the content approached. Seven nursing appointments were carried out in each of the 6 modules provided for the \"E-Care of Hipertension\"; each module was assisted by accessing the moodle platform with Sansung10.1 tablet for the use of wi-fi under the guidance of the nurse. At the end of each module the knowledge test was applied with questions referring to the content assisted in each module, and the alternatives for each question were the following statements: \"The answer is right because I already knew it\", \"The answer is right because I have learned it in the appointments\" or \"I do not know why I did not learn it\". The Interactive Learning Objects (ILOs) were made available in HTLM5, configured by the Department of Telemedicine of the School of Medicine of the University of Sao Paulo. The research was conducted from December 2014 to March 2017, approved by the Ethics Committee of Heart Institution of the School of Medicine of Sao Paulo University. Results: The predominant demographic characteristic of this study were male (8 - 57%), black (6 - 42%), Catholic (10 - 72%), married (64%) individuals. Regarding schooling, six patients (43%) had completedhigh school, and the mean age was 53 +/- 10 years. Regarding the data presented for the anthropometric variables (14 patients) at the beginning of the study and at the end of it, 120 days, the population presented statistical difference for waist circumference when comparing the beginning of follow-up and the final study period (99,61 +/- 10 vs. 99.69 +/- 8cm; p = 0.006). Regarding the knowledgetest regarding the use of the \"E-Care of Hypertension\", it can be noted that the overall performance of patients' answers was around 83.78%, which proves that it was satisfactory and as most patients chose the option that contained the expression \"I was right because I have learned it in the appointments\". This new modality of intervention inaugurates a new scenario and perspective for the improvement of therapeutic adherence, and this resource can be used to raise patients' awareness and to promote the improvement of healthy habits. Conclusion: The present study showed that the use of hybrid educational technology promotes improvements and can be an alternative to be improved as an educational technological tool."

The objective of this research was to analyze the potential of a training plan on nutritional education carried out using both educational technology and a gamified methodology. For this, a quasi-experimental design was used in a sample of 237 Spanish students of the third level of Secondary Education. After the training experience on teaching was carried out, data were collected with a questionnaire. The results showed that the teaching of nutritional education through gamification fosters motivation, the relationship among students, autonomy, time perception during classes, and the improvement of marks. It can be concluded that gamification is an effective teaching method for nutritional education for Compulsory Secondary Education students."

The main objective is to analyze the incidence of continuing education as a mandatory requirement for self-perception of teachers regarding their digital competence. For this purpose, an ex post facto design was used with a sample of 1069 pre-school and primary school teachers from all over Spain. The results showed that teachers who had previously received training in educational technology had a higher level of competence than those who had not been trained. In addition, the gender of the teachers was not a significant predictor of their level of digital competence in communicating with other teachers or with families, but it was found to be a significant predictor of their level of competence with their students. Finally, the use of digital resources such as Twitter and blogs increased this competence for teachers who already had previous experience, while for those who did not have this experience, the most significant resources were blogs and WhatsApp."

        "The human-computer interaction (HCI) design of educational technologies influences cognitive behaviour, so it is imperative to assess how different HCI strategies support intended behaviour. We developed a neuroscience-inspired game that trains children's use of \"stopping-and-thinking\" (S&T)-an inhibitory control-related behaviour-in the context of counterintuitive science problems. We tested the efficacy of four HCI features in supporting S&T: (1) a readiness mechanic, (2) motion cues, (3) colour cues, and (4) rewards/penalties. In a randomised eye-tracking trial with 45 7-to-8-year-olds, we found that the readiness mechanic increased S&T duration, that motion and colour cues proved equally effective at promoting S&T, that combining symbolic colour with the readiness mechanic may have a cumulative effect, and that rewards/penalties may have distracted children from S&T. Additionally, S&T duration was related to in-game performance. Our results underscore the importance of interdisciplinary approaches to educational technology research that actively investigates how HCI impacts intended learning behaviours."

        "Purpose The authors tested the efficacy of a team-based instructional leadership intervention designed to increase middle school mathematics and science teachers' use of educational technologies for multiple representations of content to foster students' conceptual understandings. Each school's leadership team comprised an administrator, a technology instructional specialist role, and a mathematics and a science teacher leader. Design/methodology/approach The authors tested the intervention in a quasi-experimental design with five treatment and five matched comparison schools. Participants included 48 leadership team members and 100 grade 6-8 teachers and their students. The authors analyzed data using two-level, nested multiple regressions to determine the effect of treatment on leaders' practices; leaders' practices on teachers' learning and integration; and teachers' learning and integration on students' learning. Leaders and teachers completed monthly self-reports of practices; students completed pre- and post-tests of knowledge in science and math. Findings Significant treatment effects at the leader, teacher and student levels establish the efficacy of this team-based approach to school leadership of an educational technology integration innovation. Leaders at treatment schools participated in a significantly higher total frequency and a wider variety of leadership activities, with large effect sizes. Teachers participated in a significantly wider variety of learning modes focused on technology integration and integrated technology significantly more frequently, with a wider variety of technologies, all with moderate effect sizes. Students in treatment schools significantly outperformed students in comparison schools in terms of science achievement but not in mathematics. Research limitations/implications The overall sample size is small and the approach to participant recruitment did not allow for randomized assignment to the treatment condition. The authors tested the influence of treatment on leader practices, on teacher practices, and on student achievement. Future work is needed to identify the core components of treatment that influence practice and investigate the causal relationships between specific leaders' practices, teacher practices and student achievement. Originality/value This study establishes the efficacy of a replicable approach to developing team-based instructional leaders addressing educational technology. It contributes to the knowledge base about how district leaders and leadership educators might foster school leaders' instructional leadership, and more specifically technology leadership capacity."

        "This article analyses the ways in which traditional media (press, radio, and television) portray the educational use of smartphones in secondary education. The aim of this study is to find out how the traditional media reflect the educational use of mobile phones in secondary education. For the analysis, the media outlets leaders in the audience ratings in Spain where reviewed, as well as the ones that are leaders in the four autonomous regions that are included in the project (C. Madrid, C. Valenciana, Catalonia, and Castilla-La Mancha). A qualitative study of nearly 300 press, radio, and television news items from the last 10 years was carried out, utilizing an emergent labelling process aided by triangulation, which facilitated its refinement and the emergence of categories. The qualitative analysis was complemented by counting and graphing the quantitative data. The results obtained show a large number of news items that use the abuse of mobile phone usage by young people as a pretext to argue the need to forbid or regulate their educational use. Also, important voices are underrepresented in the discourse, such as those from families, young people, and experts in educational technology. Among the conclusions obtained, it is palpable that traditional media generate a state of opinion in which the use of these devices for educational purposes cannot be separated from their general use in daily life. The dissemination of good practices is thus overshadowed by the number of negative traits associated to mobile phone use, resulting in a discouraging narrative that prevents the spread of educational experiences with mobile phones in schools."

        "The subject of chemistry is a generally despised subject by high school students due to its complexity, the accusation, however, is not baseless as chemistry actually requires multiple levels of thinking The topic of reaction rate in high school chemistry is one of the more complicated ones. The current method of delivery for chemistry, in general, is still quite conventional; as such, the conventional approach only delivers knowledge is a one-way approach and lacks conceptual thinking The existence of educational games as educational technology and its versatility shows some potency to improve the status quo. Related to the versatility, the educational game can be adapted with some degree of modification in the form of an algorithm such as dynamic difficulty adjustment. The concept of dynamic difficulty adjustment aligns similarly with the educational concept of instructional scaffolding by adapting students' performance and modify future levels as a form of scaffolding. This study aims to verify the existence of conceptual thinking improvements via an educational game designed with dynamic difficulty adjustment, which to an extent, delivers a form of visual instructional scaffolding. The study results show that educational game, in general, is able to deliver conceptual thinking based on the experiment conducted however the role of the algorithm adapted might not be the only deciding factor in an educational game context. The study also presents the experimental setup used as well as its analysis, its weakness, as well as its limitation, are also thoroughly elaborated."

        "In his State of the Nation address on 7 February 2019, the president of the Republic of South Africa. Mr. Cyril Ramaphosa, stated that the government would provide digital workbooks and textbooks to every school child in South Africa by 2025. (De Villiers, 2019). This announcement begs the question how effective the incorporation of Information and Computer Technology (ICT) is in Education. This study adapted the comprehensive model of educational effectiveness created by Creemers (1994) to explore the relationship between the use of educational technology in mathematics and mathematics achievement in South Africa. The questionnaire responses from Grade 5 students, their mathematics teachers and school principals, participating in TIMSS 2015 research project, have been utilised in this study. Findings from descriptive statistics showed that almost 90% of the students were taught by teachers who did not have computers in their mathematics classrooms. Consequently, only 10% of students were taught by teachers who utilised computers in the classroom. The minority of these teachers used computers 'every, or almost every, day' in order to explore mathematical concepts (8.37%), to search for ideas relating to mathematics (2.14%) or to practice mathematical skills and procedures (6.26%). Hierarchical linear modelling revealed that students that were in mathematical classes with computers generally outperformed those who didn't have computers."

This Comment argues that the previous school search Supreme Court cases offer poor tests for this new generation of school searches, and it propose a new framework based on other seminal Fourth Amendment cases in analogous contexts."

These presentation products offer mobile companion applications (apps) designed to both sync with content on a second screen and add additional tools to navigate and interact with slides. In this paper, we conducted two exploratory studies to investigate the mobile digital presentation needs and current experience of K-12 teachers when using mobile companion apps. We identify that current solutions fall short of addressing these needs and suggest potential design implications to better align with the in-classroom experience. Findings suggest improvements could be made by allowing teachers to capture teachable moments through text and annotations on slides improving these."

The analytical focus is the paradoxes that exist between the normalizing master narratives of Ed-Tech speak and the complexity and polyphony of everyday praxis in terms of participation. By using an educational tablet project conducted in Finnish primary and secondary schools as an empirical example this paper will problematize the promise of participation in the context of the digitalization of education through three different viewpoints: paradoxes of societal participation, paradoxes of participatory pedagogics, and paradoxical politics of participation."

Mobile applications with augmented reality experience mode have the potential to be used in online, blended/hybrid, and in-person teaching, which is particularly important during emergencies. This study's purpose was to determine primary and secondary school students' acceptance of augmented reality content in commercial mobile applications that can be used as a supplement in biology teaching. A total of 188 students (from schools included in this research) completed the online questionnaire. The results showed that the majority of students perceived mobile augmented reality applications as useful and easy to use, had a positive attitude, and expressed intention to use this educational technology if given the opportunity. The importance of prior evaluation regarding educational usability and performance is highlighted since technical quality (of used mobile applications) had a strong positive effect on perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use. There were no statistically significant differences between female and male and primary and secondary students, but students with prior experience with augmented reality rated perceived usefulness higher. Despite positive results, we need to raise our concerns regarding the reliability of using mobile augmented reality in biology education due to the lack of usable free content and the frequent cancellation of authoring tools and applications."

It aims to find answers to the following questions: Do the teachers of all the subjects in teacher training centres view this new technology as really useful and worth implementing? Are the facilities ( rooms, labs) suitable and enough? Do the teachers regard the use of this technology positive? The researcher in this study depended mainly on three data instruments: Questionnaire, interview and classroom observation. The researcher followed the deliberative approach of analysing the questionnaire and previous studies regarding integrating new technology into schools with the aim of highlighting the most important recommendations. One of these questionnaires was directed to schoolteachers. My aims are to see what they think of the implementation of technology and how far they are prepared to utilize its resources, and to find out what kind of training they had in their faculties of education prior to their graduations and whether they had any kind of further training in the use of modern technology. Another questionnaire was directed to school administrators and some administrators in the ministry of education, to find out how far they are ready of enthusiastic to provide such means of encourage teacher to use them. An important finding of the survey was that the courses in educational technology, which the teachers studied in their college, had great impact on their professional performance, particularly in the area of production, use and selection. Despite this fact they demand that the number of these courses be increased and the courses developed. Educational technology labs, studios, rooms, stores, etc... Are not given enough consideration or attention in U.A.E schools, thought the concept of the field itself and its importance appeared here quarter of a century ago. Education technology has been given lip service only. The study concludes that the attitudes of the teachers towards the use of education technology were really positive. They are all convinced with its benefits and happy to make use of it in their teaching. Almost all teachers maintain that it's necessary to have specialists and expert in education technology in schools to help teachers produce their own materials; look after the maintenance of equipment and to keep these resources up-to-date."

We found significant differences regarding the educational stage, gender and the availability of technologies in the students' homes. We concluded that the vast majority of students of Primary and Secondary Education are a generation familiar with digital technology, which is motivated and demands the continued use of ICT in schools, although it maintains a critical vision of the school tasks developed with them and of the degree of digital competence of its teaching staff."

        "In the recent years, big data and learning analytics have been emerging as fast-growing research fields. The application of these emerging research areas is gradually addressing the contemporary challenges of school and university education. Tracing out the information regarding students' misconceptions and dropping-out probabilities from the courses at the right instant of time, development of detectors of a range of educational importance and achieving the highest level of quality in the higher education are becoming more challenging. Moreover, providing well timed and the best suitable solutions to the students at-risk are even more strenuous. In this concept paper, we aim to address these contemporary challenges of school and the university education and their probable solutions by utilizing our research experiences of automated assessment, immediate feedback, learning analytics and the IT technologies. Solving such problems by knowing the history of students' activities, submissions, and the performances data is possible. The identification of students' misconceptions during the learning process, examining behavioral patterns and significant trends by efficiently aggregating and correlating the massive data, improving the state-of-the-art skills in creative thinking and innovation, and detecting the drop-outs on-time are highlighted in this article. We are aiming at extracting such knowledge so that adaptive and personalized learning will become a part of the current education system. Not only the available algorithm of supervised learning methods such as support vector machine, neural network, decision trees, discriminant analysis, and nearest neighborhood method but also new engineering and distillation of relevant data features can be carried out to solve these educational challenges."

        "Teaching aids have always been an inseparable part of the educational process. There are a lot of categories of didactic material resources contributing, on condition of their proper use, to more effective achieving of educational goals, to presentation and demonstration of the curriculum in different ways, to activation of students, to motivation to learn, to rationalization and intensification the work of teachers, and many others. Nowadays, with the continuous development of technology-supported learning environment in the digital age and with increasing demands on technology skills of teachers, it is essential to ensure quality of teaching and learning in connection with the effective and trouble-free integration of teaching aids in education, too. The paper aims to analyze the way of using teaching aids requiring educational technologies (i.e. audio-visual, auditory and electronic teaching aids) based on previous experience of graduates of secondary schools, currently university students. In other words, the exploratory survey is focused on a study of statements of these students about how their secondary school teachers used such teaching aids during the lessons and where, according to them, in the context of these aids their teachers usually made mistakes, it means what must be avoided in the future to ensure the quality of education. The target group consists of undergraduates of bachelor's degree of the Institute of Education and Communication of the Czech University of Life Sciences Prague specializing in Teacher Training who have successfully completed the course focused on the effective use of educational resources in the educational process. Discussions with the undergraduates and a questionnaire are used as tools of the survey."

        "With the rapid advancement of technology, digital literacy has become a key component in educators' professional development. A wide range of assessment tools has been developed to measure teacher digital literacy; however, there has been no previous attempt to systematically synthesize and scrutinize those tools to improve evaluation of this ability among educators. The current study reviews literature on instruments that assess teacher digital literacy with the purposes of ascertaining the main aspects of it that recent researchers focus on in their evaluation, instrument types used for assessment, and the reliability and validity report, as well as the frameworks or models used to design assessment tools. The review selected 33 English-language publications in the field of educational technology from peer-reviewed journals indexed in the Education Resources Information Center (ERIC), Web of Science, and Scopus. The study period spanned from 2011 to 2022 with the objective of reviewing the tools used to assess teacher digital competence. The major findings demonstrate that scholars focus on digital competence in teachers' use of educational technology, teaching and learning, professional development, and support for learners through digital competence. Other researchers emphasize the ability of educators to apply technology to the assessment of learner outcomes or to empower students in using technology to enhance learning. Additionally, self-evaluation instruments are common, whereas a few studies promote subjective evaluation in combination with objective assessment to provide a comprehensive understanding of teacher digital competence. The results form the basis for several recommendations for future research for the further examination of teacher digital literacy."

The aims of this study is to analyse the integration of Tablets in Spanish Schools, taking into account some of the critical aspects of the educational-technological innovation. Results of a test completed by 1778 primary and secondary school students from 31 schools and 6 autonomous communities are provided. In an analysis of the main results, we found that there are no significant changes on teacher's evaluation methods, with respect to the methods used before the introduction of Tablets; the lack of innovation methodologies associated with technology, especially those referred to videogames and on-line collaboration; the high level of coexistence between Tablets and other analogical resources, which points out the existence of a mixt model of technological integration; the receptivity to Tablets shown mainly by students, but also by teachers and parents; and the self-perception of improved academic achievement attributed to the use of Tablets, significantly better in those students with high and medium grades, but scarcely appreciable in those with low grades."

ClassDojo is one of the most popular and successful educational technologies and is used internationally. It is a school-based social media platform that incorporates a gamified behaviour-shaping function, providing school communities with a centralised digital network in which to interact. We argue that ClassDojo's datafying system of school discipline intensifies and normalises the surveillance of students. Furthermore, it creates a culture of performativity and serves as a mechanism for behaviour control."

        "The rapid digitalization following COVID-19 necessitates best-practice knowledge on how to use educational technologies such as immersive virtual reality (IVR). At the same time, to deal with climate change, we require new ways to embed climate change education in formal education. The current study is one of the first to investigate the feasibility of an alternative educational approach to improving waste management in the classroom as part of formal education, utilizing mastery experiences in IVR. We explore the use of a novel IVR simulation on waste management, an example of pro-environmental behavior, for climate change education. A total of 173 high school students participated in a pre-registered intervention investigating the impact of IVR on knowledge and intentions to act pro-environmentally. A 2x2 design was used to compare different design approaches to the IVR simulation based on the instructional design elements of the in-struction sequence (Direct Instruction vs. Productive Failure) and feedback (Corrective Feedback vs. Exaggerated Feedback). The results indicated that IVR was effective for increasing students' knowledge (r/2 = 0.41), intentions (r/2 = 0.10), self-efficacy (r/2 = 0.4), and response efficacy (r/2 = 0.35) and that students found the simulation interesting and enjoyable. Furthermore, self-efficacy was found to predict intentions (B = 0.190, p = .015), supporting the idea that cognitive and affective factors drive the effectiveness of IVR. No significant differences were found in the effectiveness of the instructional design elements. This suggests that IVR can be an effective educational technology for learning through mastery experiences, but that more research on the boundary conditions of how and when to apply different instructional design elements effectively is needed."

It takes the standards set by international organizations and the Spanish Ministry of Education as a basis to define the dimensions of digital competence and the two aspects studied: technical knowledge and educational application. Data was collected through a purpose-built questionnaire. The results show that teachers recognize the contribution that ITC can make to the teaching-learning process, but that, despite an average level of performance for personal use (searching for information, using the most common tools), teachers' application of ITC to education is poor. The results highlight the need to strengthen teachers' initial training and promote continuing education programs to develop competence."

The study highlighted the high school principals' perception of maintaining education quality concerning curriculum, instruction, and assessment. The study focused on the admission process, teaching, and learning performances of the top nine high schools in South and central Somalia. The methodology of this Qualitative study was descriptive phenomenology. The research design and approach were semi-structured open-ended interview protocol that comprised eight interview questions. Purposeful sampling was the sampling method. Nine principals participated in the study and provided the research data regarding the education quality of nine high schools in Somalia. All nine principals in this study maintained their high schools' education quality using a rigorous admission process. They utilized a government-developed official curriculum. Five principals reported that they employed specialist instructors, while six stated that their students actively participated in the learning process during class time. However, all the participants reported that smartphones hindered student learning. A slight majority of five principals (56%) stated that parental interventions were vital to schools' overall learning achievements. Somalia's public schools are far behind in utilizing effective educational technology. The technological literacy of the teachers is vital to effectively employ the accessible educational technology, which encouraged students to incorporate modern technologies in their learning activities successfully. Rigorous admission process, efficient curriculum, instruction, effective instructional materials, employing professional instructors, and active learning are all important components to maintain education quality."

Among other findings, the evidence showed aspects which made technological integration distinct between students during Practicum (e.g. the school's technological background). By including ICTs, there emerged potentialities (e.g., ubiquity of learning) and difficulties (e.g. technological problems) that shed light on the aspects to be considered in the applicability of technological learning to the field of physical activities in the natural environment."

        "Goal five of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals calls for increased female participation in socioeconomic growth and development. Achieving this goal requires promoting females' participation in fields such as science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) which facing a dire shortage of personnel. However, existing efforts to increase female participation in STEM professions in Nigeria are limited in two ways: firstly, they are not focused on young females between the ages of 11 and 18. Secondly, most existing studies are not focused on the affective aspect of learning. Given the claims in existing literature that females' disinterest in STEM professions is affective rather than cognitive, this article employs the attitude-change approach, also known as the persuasion approach, to motivate females to pursue STEM pathways. We conducted an empirical study among young female students, STEM teachers and STEM professionals from Nigeria. Based on the empirical study, a framework indicating the key components that educational technology designers should consider when developing technologies to motivate young females in Nigeria to pursue STEM professions is presented. Transdisciplinary contribution: This study is unique in that it combines strategies from various fields. The framework's persuasive strategies are drawn from the field of psychology, the innovative pedagogies are drawn from the field of education and the design science research approach is drawn from the field of information systems. This implies that increasing female participation in socioeconomic growth requires transdisciplinary research. This also has implications for how other United Nations Sustainable Development Goals can be met through transdisciplinary research."

        "In order to develop 21st-century skills, especially with respect to digital technologies, students are supposed to know how to use digital technologies for learning and problem solving. In recent years, approaches to personalized learning have been considered to be particularly promising in this regard. A clearly defined concept of personalized learning is still lacking, however. Rather, it serves an umbrella term for educational approaches that try to do justice to the individual abilities, knowledge and learning needs of each student. Our study deals with theoretical dimensions of this multilayered concept and investigates the in-school use of digital technologies for personalized learning as reported by students in connection with their self-assessed digital skills and beliefs about the usefulness of ICT in learning. For this purpose, we have analyzed data from a survey of N = 860 students (8th grade) from 31 Swiss schools that have introduced personalized learning concepts. A structural equation model shows that increased reported use of digital technologies in learning environments that are characterized by open teaching methods is an important aspect of personalized learning because it has a positive effect on both self-reported digital skills and self-perceived ICT-related beliefs in learning. At the same time, the experienced freedom of choice in learning activities that include digital technologies, which is often considered a crucial dimension of personalized learning, has no significant effect."

Quantitative results suggest that the profile with professional content was most credible. Credibility ratings were also associated with other twitter use variables, including positive student attitudes about instructors who use Twitter and tweet frequency. Coded qualitative responses indicated that Twitter may be both an asset and an obstacle for instructors."

It compares students working online in pairs with those working alone. We explain why the intervention had some positive effects for struggling writers but few effects for skilled writers. The qualitative analysis of student online writing products, student peer feedback, and teacher interviews indicated that struggling writers in the experimental group wrote more ambitious but less coherent stories than struggling writers in the control group, and that skilled writers in the experimental group received poor-quality feedback and were less inclined to revise than skilled writers in the control group. We provide suggestions for writing instruction and technology support for skilled and struggling writers."

It argues that although significant progress has been made in implementing technologies in schools, ICT is still mainly used by teachers and students outside the school environment. The empirical basis of these findings come from a 2009 online survey with 7,659 primary and secondary school teachers, and from 80 interviews with educational stakeholders. Almost all the teachers surveyed are positive about the potential of ICT for learning and are using the internet as a resource for information and preparing lessons. The use of ICT in the classroom is less widespread. Few of the teachers surveyed recognized the benefits of interactive and collaborative technologies for learning. In addition, digital games and mobile phones are widely underestimated. These findings contrast with the potential of technologies to transform educational practices."

        "Set against the backdrop of a succession of educational technology policies in Ireland, influenced by international discourses, this study aimed to explore how Irish pre-service teachers justify the use of mobile technologies in schools. In order to achieve this, 23 pre-service teachers were presented with a vignette that asked them to justify the use of a one-to-one tablet initiative in school. The research found that pre-service teachers tended to justify the initiative, as they saw the increasing technification of schools and society as an inevitable process. In addition, they presented pragmatic reasons for using the technology rather than highlighting their educational/pedagogic value. This study points to the need to challenge pre-service teachers' innovation-centric and techno-centric attitudes towards technology use. It also highlights the need for teacher educators, as a whole, to take a more active role in addressing this issue in teacher education programmes."

This study developed a questionnaire to understand the status of Emergency Remote Learning (ERL) in nursing education internationally, translated it into 7 languages, and distributed it to 18 countries. A total of 328 nursing educators responded, and the most often used online methods were Social networking technology such as Facebook, Google+ and Video sharing platform such as YouTube. The ERL applied to nursing education was positively evaluated as 3.59 out of 5. The results of the study show that during the two semesters nursing college professors have well adapted to this unprecedent crisis of teaching. The world after COVID-19 has become a completely different place, and nursing education should be prepared for 'untact' education."

The adoption of digital educational technologies and platforms is transforming teaching-learning pro-cesses, adding new complexities in terms of school linkage, rights and equity. While there has been a growing inter-est in children's rights (and the right to privacy in particular) in relation to the use of digital networks and platforms in recent decades, there is still little evidence as to the perceptions of families of the use of these technologies in educational contexts. Therefore, this article presents the design and psychometric validation of an instrument that allows us to delve into the opinions and concerns of families with regard to the presence of technological corpora-tions (BigTech) in schools and the use of digital educational platforms by their children. The instrument was designed after a review of the literature on the subject and interviews with experts in this field of study. The design of the questionnaire was enriched with the comments and recommendations of specialists and families gathered via three validation processes. The instrument was implemented online to a representative sample of families with children enrolled in primary and secondary public schools in Catalonia. The analysis of the results shows the suitability of the proposed dimensions and the reliability of the instrument."

During the COVID-19 pandemic, distance learning has become an urgent necessity, highlighting the importance of digital education, particularly when social distancing is esse ntial for saving lives. However, the inequality in access to educational technologies in Brazil exposes the difficulties face d by many students, demonstrating that simply having access to technology does not guarantee a significant improvement in teaching and learning processes. Given this scenario, it is crucial to promote a debate on strategies that can be used both in online and offline environments, providing educators with a solid foundation to enhance their pedagogical practices. One such strategy is gamification, which involves the use of game elements in non-playful contexts to engage students in the learning process. Gamification holds potential for creating an \"optimal\" learning experience, especially at a time when rethinking the school routine is necessary."

        "Policy changes in response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic at Iowa State University College of Veterinary Medicine (ISU-CVM) included the administrative directive that fourth-year (VM4) clinical rotations immediately transition from in-person to virtual format. This article summarizes the efforts, successes, and challenges experienced by ISU-CVM clinical faculty during this transition. Numerous data sources were reviewed, including college records and announcements, faculty survey results, and student rotation evaluations. Data were explored using quantitative and qualitative methods. Between March and July 2020, 36 faculty from 15 different clinical services invested approximately 5,000 hours in delivering virtual content to 165 VM4 students from ISU-CVM and Caribbean veterinary schools. With departmental, college, and university assistance, faculty effectively used educational technologies (Zoom, Canvas, Echo360) and developed adaptive and innovative methods for virtual content delivery. Virtual VM4 rotations were collectively well received and appreciated by students, and student evaluation scores were statistically equivalent or higher for virtual rotations than for the corresponding in-person rotations in the preceding year. Although certain hands-on skills could not be adequately acquired in a virtual environment, students gained theoretical knowledge and case-based problem-solving skills in the online format. Faculty reported satisfaction with their adaptability and resilience in these challenging circumstances. These findings demonstrate that ISU-CVM clinical faculty invested substantial time and effort to transition in-person clinical rotations to virtual format during the early COVID-19 pandemic. This is particularly noteworthy given that many of these same faculty simultaneously served as essential personnel managing clinical cases in the university's teaching hospital."

        "The flipped classroom is an innovative and increasingly popular pedagogical approach in higher education. It emphasises student learning responsibility, deeper learning, differentiated instruction and more efficient use of class time. However, despite its increasing popularity across disciplines, few studies have elaborated on strategies for implementing a flipped classroom beyond its essential elements. The present study thus proposed a three stage collaborative instructional model (3-CI), an extension of the classic flipped classroom model. A case study approach was adopted to investigate 3-CI's effectiveness through students' perceptions in Research Methods in Educational Technology, with 29 graduate students. Results show that 3-CI increases participants' satisfaction, engagement and collaboration. Furthermore, 3-CI design strategies, which emphasise collaboration and student-centredness, can help college educators to incorporate the flipped approach into their teaching practice."

        "At the contemporary stage of higher education system's development in Ukraine, plenty of ideas in education drift along, find purchase with the right crowd, and as long as they present a more engaging method of learning than traditional schooling, are hailed as innovative. This is a fallacy that stands directly in the way of true innovation in edtech. And another sad fact is that educational products are judged against criteria that are much harder to pin down, so they can often get away with just being different. Teaching practice however shows efficient ed-techs that augment our natural ability to learn and improve students' results. Nowadays blended learning, instructional Internet resources, BYOD (bring your own device) policies etc. are being implemented into the process of the prospective specialists' professionally oriented competence development. These trends are significantly affecting higher education and show the need for technology that improves the quality of teaching via digital and online media. From short-term to long-term, in more and more Ukrainian higher educational establishments a number of different technologies, students will benefit from, are put into practice. And the aim of the given paper is to explore them and highlight all the benefits. Institutions implement different ed-tech, but the purpose is to open up the world as one big global arena. That is why it is of a crucial importance to define the impact of technology on learning process and on quality of higher education in general. In order to find out the efficiency of innovative technologies in educational process, the pilot training was held, the results of which are depicted in the article. As a result, the implementation of instructional internet resources proved its paramount efficiency and flexibility for both teaching and learning."

The purpose of this chapter is to demonstrate potential of Second Lifes as a space for teaching practices of pre-service teachers. The participants were 160 college students who were completing a practicum at Korea National University of Education. These students enrolled in four sections of teaching methods and educational technology, which was one of the requirements for their teaching certificate. The students were placed in groups of three to five students according to their majors. In Second Life, they practiced their teaching and participated in the evaluation of other groups' teaching. They discussed Second Life's potential, such as a space for expanding their teaching experiences and explored possibilities for using it as an environment for teaching practices. The authors believe that readers will find that Second Life can offer a valuable environment to promote pre-teachers' understanding of teaching techniques."

Therefore, this paper evaluates the use of SMARTboard in class, in combination with teacher training, using a randomized field experiment among 199 pre-vocational students in seventh grade in the Netherlands. During 6 weeks, students in the intervention group participated in math classes in which the SMARTboard was used to apply level differentiation. The teachers of these classes received a specific training (Technological Pedagogical and Content Knowledge [TPACK]) in using the SMARTboard in class. Control classes were taught by teachers without the training, who did not use the SMARTboard in class. The results showed that level differentiation in class, which was possible because of the efficient use of the SMARTboard, significantly increased math proficiency with 0.25 points."

        "In a randomized field trial with 2,850 seventh-grade mathematics students, we evaluated whether an educational technology intervention increased mathematics learning. Assigning homework is common yet sometimes controversial. Building on prior research on formative assessment and adaptive teaching, we predicted that combining an online homework tool with teacher training could increase learning. The online tool ASSISTments (a) provides timely feedback and hints to students as they do homework and (b) gives teachers timely, organized information about students 'work. To test this prediction, we analyzed data from 43 schools that participated in a random assignment experiment in Maine, a state that provides every seventh-grade student with a laptop to take home. Results showed that the intervention significantly increased student scores on an end-of-the-year standardized mathematics assessment as compared with a control group that continued with existing homework practices. Students with low prior mathematics achievement benefited most. The intervention has potential for wider adoption."

The simulation is embedded within an inquiry-based technology-mediated science curriculum known as the Web-Based Inquiry Science Environment (WISE). For this research, students from a suburban, diverse, middle school setting were asked to use the simulation as part of a week-long class lesson on global warming and climate change. Using a combination of student interviews, focus groups, and students' conversations while they used the simulation, the authors present evidence of shifts in student motivation, understanding of science content, and ideas about the nature of science, all connected to the use of the simulation. From this data, the authors derived ways that teachers can help students develop deeper understandings of climate science topics through educational technology. Examples of these pedagogical approaches included allowing students to conduct \"extreme testing\" and increasing the time for free exploration of the simulation."

        "The conception of learning is a psychological construct that influences learning outcomes. Therefore, many researchers have explored the concept of learning, especially in higher education. This study aims to identify students' conceptions of learning based on differences in majors. Identifying student learning conceptions is very important for future education to help them understand the nature of learning and help them become a student aware of their duties and responsibilities. Moreover, in the end, they can guide the learning process independently to achieve maximum learning outcomes. A total of 136 voluntary respondents were taken randomly from four majors, namely veterinary education (54 students), biology education (38 students), educational technology (26 students), and educational administration (18 students). The instrument used to measure students' conceptions of learning was adapted from the conception of learning science (CoLS) developed by Lee et al. (2008). The data were analyzed descriptively and multivariately using SPSS 24 for windows at a significance of 5%. From the results of the analysis that has been done, it is concluded that veterinary education students tend to have mixed conceptions of learning (reproductive and constructive), and biology education and educational technology students tend to have constructive learning conceptions. In contrast, educational administration students tend to be quantitative or reproductive profiles. The difference in majors does not affect our participants' learning conceptions. The implications of these results are briefly described in the conclusions, limitations and recommendations."

        "The integration of technology in K-12 education is highlighted in the ISTE Standards, Common Core State Standards Initiative, and Elementary and Secondary Education Act. Preservice teacher education must reevaluate how technology integration is approached, examining preservice teacher attitudes and competencies toward instructional design and technology use. Recent studies indicate that, while preservice teachers demonstrate a high level of understanding of technology tools, they do not integrate those tools naturally into classroom settings for lesson delivery, assessment and classroom management. In a world of rapidly changing technology tools, preservice teacher education must develop an instructional and philosophical approach that identifies challenges and opportunities for technology integration in teaching and learning. This chapter provides an overview of research that explores the integration of educational technology in preservice teacher education. It provides emerging recommendations for design and redesign of those programs."

        "The need to introduce new educational technologies into the educational process is considered a necessary condition for the further development of pedagogical sciences and practice. Social media are one of the educational resources that take into account modern pedagogical approaches and are widely applicable at the level of primary education. The paper presents one of the effective ways of implementing social media in the environment of elementary schools in the Czech Republic with using the methods project-based learning. This method allows the application and interconnection of knowledge from various disciplines, motivates pupils to independent work, searching, discovering, team cooperation and communication; provides enough space for the development of pupils' key competencies. The basic idea of the described activity was to support the process of implementing new technologies in teaching, to strengthen cooperative skills of pupils, to introduce pupils to the cultural heritage of their region and promote the development of cooperation between schools within the partnership. The project also provided opportunities to meet the BYOD model when pupils use their own mobile devices in teaching."

        "Differentiated learning technology has been used for a long time. However, with the introduction of innovative educational technologies, it acquires new features and therefore requires additional research. Higher schools are in the process of searching for elements based on a personality-focused approach and introduce the most effective technologies in this process. The purpose of the article is to discusses the implementation of technologies that provide a single differentiation in the process of preparing students. The characteristic of students' work in differentiated educational conditions is presented. Teaching and training students is arranged in groups. As a result, there is a way to prepare competent students, making them highly qualified professionals. The study shows that there are great opportunities in teaching students of a higher educational institution. The formation of competencies with the help of differentiated learning technology becomes more effective, since individual characteristics of each student are taken into account and their interest and motivation to study a particular course increases. Differentiated tasks allow you to monitor dynamics of the development of students' competence, the systematic implementation of a certain type of tasks that are suitable for certain groups of students.The article presents a study of the level of training of students of the University of the 3rd year of study. The study was conducted in 2018 throughout the school year. Our results are based on data obtained from two groups of students with the same number of subjects. The introduction of differentiated learning technology can improve the quality of training of higher education institutions students. With the help of these technologies, each student, building training in accordance with their personal characteristics and professional needs, achieves success in mastering the material, quickly forms professional competence. The results of the study focused on the quality of training showed that differentiated technologies improve students' performance."

        "Designers of educational technologies often develop products with the best intentions, but only to face the fact that the usage rate is low once the products are released. This suggests that learning, understanding and listening to potential users' ideas and proposals is essential. This research focuses on the study of an online school Live Fairytales aimed at Russian language learners aged 3-5 who live outside of Russia or who grow up in multiethnic areas of the Russian Federation. The team of researchers conducted a study to examine how the newly developed online school material meets the needs of educators who work with very young learners. Online language resources of Live Fairytales were integrated into the regular curriculum of five sites and involved 51 children aged 3-5. Data sources included reports of five educators from research sites. The reports contained information on the group of children (their number, age and gender), the date and time of the pilot version testing, a detailed description of the lessons and their analysis. Each report ended with recommendations for the online school designers. Study results demonstrate that the educators were mostly satisfied with the school concept. What is more, having performed as \"channels\" for providing the researchers with information on the very young students' learning experience, they reported the learners' excitement over interacting with the online school. However, they expressed their desire to adjust the text and audio-visual content of the school by simplifying the language of fairytales and shortening their length, adding songs and additional illustrations, that is to enhance multimodality features of the digital resources. Furthermore, the educators made valuable suggestions about improving the navigation system of the website of the online school. For that reason, users' feedback should be regularly obtained throughout the life cycle of the design and implementation of educational technology: from its initial development to its eventual release."

In India the basic qualification for recruitment of faculty for Engineering and Polytechnic Colleges is post graduation in their respective branch of engineering and mostly they don't have any education or training in pedagogy related aspects of teaching and learning. Therefore, the recruited novice teachers are inducted in the teaching profession by providing them a rigorous training of two weeks induction training programme on pedagogy and educational technology aspects. At the end of two weeks training, each teacher was asked to teach in a simulated teaching setting having a session of 15 minutes duration to demonstrate these teaching skills. Performances of teachers were assessed on different aspects on a five-point rating scale. To ascertain the understanding of teaching-learning process and pedagogy, an assessment test based on 50 multiple-choice questions related to education technology and pedagogy aspects such as domains of learning, learning principles, methods of instruction, student assessment etc were asked. The study was carried out to ascertain the correlation of teacher's performance in their teaching sessions with the response on multiple choice questions. We administered a test of 50 multiple-choice questions to about 80 newly recruited teachers of different engineering disciplines. This paper discusses the correlation between the two kinds of assessments, namely teachers' understanding of the concepts related to effective teaching and their actual teaching performance."

MTS is a non-profit institution located in the countryside of Luziania city, (Brazil), promoting 1st phase of elementary school and youth and adult education. In 2013, offered free and quality educational service for 208 students, among children, teenagers and adults from low-income families in the common and special, under the educational inclusion. About 60 students have some type of disabilities, such as: Down syndrome, autism, mental, physical, auditory deficiencies. The proposal is based on constructivism and educational, technological and social inclusion. Founded in 1994, MTS has worked since its origin with the \"pedagogy of respect for differences\", understanding difference as richness. Stimulates the development of efficiencies instead of highlighting the deficiencies. Luziania is considered the 16th most violent city in Brazil, with few opportunities for young people at social risk. MTS adopts the Brazilian Sign Language as a discipline. Everyone learns LIBRAS, not just the deaf students. In addition, LIBRAS is used as an alternative communication to listeners students with difficulty speech, with great results. MTS has an ecological action with recycled material, promoting sustainable productive chain, avoiding waste, generating income with craft workshops from the transformed objects sale. MTS presented their demands to the group of engineers involved in humanitarian technology, being an NGO-partner of the IEEE-SIGHT-PUCMinas because of the need for accessible and assistive technologies appropriate technologies and innovative teaching methodology."

The ubiquity of computers in schools is creating an environment wherein discussions are less about whether to integrate computers into schools but rather how best should that occur. School leaders must ensure that the integration of technology into schools creates a situation that is better than the one that exists now. Currently this is a condition that is assumed, but not guaranteed if not explicitly designed. I argue that the tenets of design thinking are well suited to serve school leaders in this regard and suggest that school leaders who adopt a \"design attitude,\" as opposed to a commonly used \"decision attitude,\" will be able to create exponential, innovative change in schools."

Driven by expert recommendations for increased teacher preparation focused on addressing this phenomenon, we sought to cultivate preservice teachers' (PSTs') digital equity mindsets in a stand-alone technology integration course. A qualitative analysis of pre- and post-course drawings and written reflections where PSTs indicated their intentions to build digital equity in the curriculum showed a significant evolution of their mindsets in five related dimensions of digital equity. This study provides novel insight into how PSTs' digital equity mindsets can be effectively cultivated, and how doing so might engender more equitable technology integration practices in the K-12 curriculum."

        "This study examined how one-to-one initiatives were conducted in rural public K-12 educational settings in a mid-western US state. Research data were gathered from interview responses from 15 school personnel who were either educational technology directors or school principals at 15 rural public K-12 schools. The study found that when schools decided to embrace one-to-one initiatives, decisions were often made by committees with limited membership and cost was frequently and/or primarily the committees' major consideration. In addition to cost, device management, durability, and ease of use were factors that school committees were interested in, when selecting devices. Two notable discrepancies cited that should be addressed by committees considering implementing one-to-one initiative are: 1. Not preparing teachers and administrators to effectively use those devices prior to the implementation of the initiative. 2. Not evaluating the instructional effectiveness and learning gains after the implementation of the initiative."

An early version of KATE has shown positive, meaningful, and statistically significant effects on five dimensions of student reading comprehension skills in previous rigorous research with diverse samples. As a result, a new rigorous study of KATE is being designed to answer the question, can KATE replicate or improve on the positive effects in previous research at scale in 64 schools, 384 teachers, and 8448 students across multiple districts and states? Accurately answering this question requires thoughtful planning, designing, and recruiting with attention to Evidence Synthesis Clearinghouses review standards. Study results may be reviewed, rated, and publicly disseminated by these Clearinghouses beyond just peer-review journals."

        "Importance: Challenged to teach increasingly complex content to students, occupational therapy educators need effective instructional approaches. The explosion of multimedia and digital resources in college classrooms suggests that solutions to teaching complicated concepts should leverage educational technology. The multimedia principle of pretraining offers one technique for enriching instruction. The principle of pretraining specifies that learning is more effective when the names and characteristics of main terms are introduced before detailed concepts are presented. Objective: To compare the efficacy of three approaches to pretraining for increasing student mastery of complex health care content. Design: Pretest, posttest, delayed posttest (after 2 wk). Setting: University. Participants: First-year occupational therapy students (N = 145) at three West Coast universities. Intervention: One of three 12-min video interventions was administered to participants: traditional enhanced pretraining, static concept map pretraining, or animated concept map pretraining. A subsequent 1-hr live lecture on the complex topic of sensory integration theory expanded on the pretraining foundation and was presented to all students. Outcomes and Measures: Schematic knowledge, which refers to the web of interrelated information built during the learning process, was measured using a structured word association test. Results: Participants benefited from all types of pretraining, yet the greatest gains were seen with the static concept map pretraining approach. Conclusions and Relevance: Pretraining with a static concept map provides effective preparation for complex content learning and preferentially assists learners with low prior knowledge of a topic. Despite its surface sophistication, an animated concept map does not increase pretraining effectiveness and is not recommended. What This Article Adds: As occupational therapy educators are charged with teaching ever more complex content augmented by the use of educational technology, finding practical strategies to enhance student learning is key. Pretraining using a static (onepage or one-screen) concept map introduces new terminology to the learner while simultaneously providing an overview of a topic. Then, when more complex concepts are introduced, exposure to the topic and prior knowledge have already been primed, thus increasing learning potential."

It was also aimed to explore how this particular global crisis and unprecedented times of education have affected teachers' motivation and their perceptions of the teaching profession. Twenty-two teachers working at different levels and types of K-12 schools in different cities in Turkey were interviewed by utilizing a phenomenological qualitative inquiry method. Our analysis showed that the obligatory transition to distance education created new opportunities and challenges for both teachers and students. While the teachers had emotional exhaustion, stress, and professional difficulties; distance education helped them develop new skills to better integrate educational technologies into classroom teaching. The findings also indicated that the COVID-19 crisis reinforced deep-rooted inequities in the Turkish education context. This study offers several implications for policymakers and educators to plan educational recovery from COVID-19."

As for the data analysis, descriptive statistics, and multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) were used to verify the possible influences of gender and student phase on students' styles. The results showed a predominance of the theoretical style among all students. Among the professors, the pragmatic style prevailed. Although the theoretical style was predominant, the other styles were also contemplated. Therefore, the importance of using different technological tools and educational strategies that contemplate the different learning styles of students is visualized."

Among the key findings, it was found that despite the use of technology (projector and computer) most teachers still use the traditional method where the teacher is the transmitter of knowledge and the student is a mere passive recipient. Digital skills include technical and pedagogical use of ICT in education and training teachers with these skills contributes to improve the teaching-learning process."

        "As the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in school closures since early 2020, children have spent more time online through virtual classrooms using educational technology (EdTech) and videoconferencing applications. This increased presence of children online exposes them to more risk of cyber threats. Here, we present a review of the current research and policies to protect children while online. We seek to answer four key questions: what are the online threats against children when learning online, what is known about children's cybersecurity awareness, what government policies and recommendations are implemented and proposed to protect children online, and what are the proposed and existing efforts to teach cybersecurity to children? Our study emphasizes the online risks to children and the importance of protective government policies and educational initiatives that give kids the knowledge and empowerment to protect themselves online."

As a business strategy as to how to handle future economic crises, Parson's model was adapted to the current situation. The authors conclude that government-funded schools will survive the pandemic. Catholic schools and other big schools may do better than religious schools and Muslim schools. It is important to keep an eye on, update, and evaluate financial stability. By evaluating teachers' skills with educational technology, we can make sure they know how to use it to improve their teaching, since students may see this as the \"New Normal\" in school. The results also show how important government assistance programs are, which, despite their flaws, may help make the country's young people friendlier and more nationalistic."

The qualitative data analysis revealed that when instruction on Lego robotics technology is integrated into semester long mathematics methods courses, PSTs are able to improve their TPACK knowledge in regard to the robotics. Overall, the findings suggest instruction of educational technology tools should be incorporated into methods courses over a longer duration of time. and in depth, to better support the development of PSTs' TPACK. To meet the demands of the teacher shortages while simultaneously supporting the needs of school districts, this research provides preliminary evidence of the need to incorporate content-specific technology into all methods courses."

        "This paper looks at the development of an e-assessment prototype as part of the digital transformation for the usual assessment practices among communication lecturers. This prototype is an innovative educational technology that was created for the easy evaluation of student assignments. The e-assessment prototype was developed based on the three levels of digital literacy of communication lecturers. The first level measured the lecturers' digital competency by assessing their Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) through sets of questionnaires. The second level determined the features and requirements of the e-assessment through focus group discussions among lecturers. Finally, in the third level, an e-assessment prototype that meets the features and requirements identified was created. The sample of respondents who participated in this study were lecturers from the School of Communication and Creative Arts in KDU University College, Malaysia. This paper documents how the findings of the three levels of digital literacy were used as the foundation for developing an e-assessment prototype called Operational Metric Assessment and Rubrics (OMAR). This e-assessment prototype, consisting of features and requirements as determined by the sampled lecturers, is useful in evaluating and assessing student work."

To these problems, a time circumstance is added since teachers need enough time to update themselves. In recent years some new trends have been emerging and have taken more strength in innovation, fostering new forms of teaching. Their intention in educational centers is to prepare students for a new type of society, which is the information society. For this reason, this work proposes the use of the design thinking methodology for the development of a mobile application, efficient and usable for teaching kinematics, obtaining a favorable result given to the acceptance of a sample of fifth-year students from a high school."

The work in this chapter aims to contribute to this dialogue in two ways. First, it introduces the Digital Learning Ecosystem as an empirically grounded framework that provides a holistic perspective of the mutually interdependent variables shaping a technology-enabled learning environment. In addition to proposing the Digital Learning Ecosystem, this chapter continues the tradition of identifying and sharing promising research-based practices that are empirically linked to improved learning outcomes by underserved students."

Educational technology has become an indispensable part of teaching-learning. Technologies for Language Learning and Teaching (TLLT) can provide language learners with exposure to authentic and intelligible language usage. EL teachers, consequently, need to have a good command over TLLT and their effective use. Following a multiple case study approach data were collected from ten EL teachers of five SS through classroom observations, face-to-face interviews, and a structured questionnaire The findings showed that most teachers had basic technology skills but they made ineffective pedagogic use of technology. They need to use technology more often in classroom and develop pedagogical understanding of technology use for teaching English."

        "As innovations in instructional methods and educational technology become more prevalent, it becomes increasingly important to understand how research-based learning resources are utilised by students in their education. This qualitative study examines the motivators and barriers impacting students' choices to engage with their class-provided learning resources. Students from two semesters of a core, undergraduate Dynamics course were interviewed regarding their study habits, use of resources, and perceptions of the course environment. Our results centre on availability and relevance: students were motivated to find immediately available, effective resources, and often encountered barriers due to scheduling concerns and doubts regarding the information their resources provided. Our findings expand on previous literature examining students' help seeking choices, giving insight into students' individual needs and concerns within a Blended Learning context. The implications of these findings are discussed, including concrete changes to the existing Dynamics course and insights regarding opportunities for future inquiry."

These classes experienced in-person, virtual, and hybridized anatomy curriculum, respectively. There was not a single instance noted where in-person curriculum produced higher examination scores than virtual or hybridized models. By incorporating virtual or hybridized models of anatomy, medical education programs can effectively reach and educate students far beyond the traditional cadaver laboratory."

Qualitative analysis of texts was made from 1992 to early 2014 in order to identify meanings associated with reusability and its evolution over time. Results show that reusability is not a univocal concept and its meaning has evolved from its early years, especially focusing over the last decade on adaptation processes. Furthermore, the review indicates that reusability has traveled through a complex path from a technological to an educational context and the ideas related to it, in each case, projected different practical implications. A more profound understanding of such ideas is critical to face institutional approaches to create and reuse open educational resources as well as the design and implementation of open educational practices."

        "Contribution: This paper employs the automatic scoring of short essays as a novel way to determine pre-service teachers' knowledge of and attitudes toward computational thinking (CT) from their written reflections. Implications about designing CT courses for pre-service teachers are discussed. Background: CT is an essential 21st-century competency that supports the development of problem-solving skills. Inspired by computing science problem-solving practices, CT should transcend disciplines, but few universities or colleges include CT courses or CT content in their core courses. It is also difficult to know what pre-service teachers think about CT and their role in promoting it. Research Questions: Do pre-service teachers' coding reflections reveal any important information about their knowledge of, skills in, and attitudes toward CT? Methodology: Traditional qualitative techniques based on human raters are impractical in analyzing hundreds of essays. Topic modeling, an unsupervised machine learning modeling technique, was employed to extract topical features from participants' reflections. In one section of an undergraduate Introduction to Educational Technology course offered at a large university in Western Canada, n=139 pre-service teachers wrote a short reflection on their experience following a 20 h Accelerated Intro to Computer Science Code.org course. Topics were identified by analyzing contextual trends in participants' written reflections. Findings: Results showed that pre-service teachers' reflections included CT concepts, practices, and perspectives. Specifically, participants connected the coding activity to prior knowledge and experiences."

        "Educational management and social psychology researchers have frequently suggested that job burnout and even turnover intention of college teachers can be induced by stress, which is an inherent part of fast-changing environments and advanced educational technology. However, studies about the contingency effect remain limited. We articulate the effect of role stress and technostress by integrating organizational behaviour and educational management literature. Particularly, this study tries to investigate the moderating effect of teacher agility and leader-member exchange differentiation on suppressing burnout. According to the job demands-resources model, we proposed that the negative effect of stress on burnout depends on the degree of agility and leader-member change quality (LMXD). A study of 271 samples supports the propositions. Specifically, the adverse effect of role stress on job burnout is strengthened by both employee agility and LMXD. We further elaborate theoretical implications on educational management, social psychology, and job demands-resources model."

Facebook is utilized as a Web 2.0 tool available via mobile phone to create and facilitate a virtual learning environment for pre-service teachers. Facebook is used to connect pre-service teachers with practicing teachers in the field. Through online discussions and postings, pre-service teachers reflect on their learning while observing practicing teachers who reflect on their teaching. The interaction between the groups facilitates an interface between educational technology theory and practice. This enriches both groups by improving both learning and practice. This activity was used in a teacher education course called \"Integrated Media and Technology Education'' (IMTE) at the Windhoek College of Education in Namibia, Africa."

        "There is no consensus regarding a common set of metrics for robot task complexity in associated human-robot interactions. This paper is an attempt to address this issue by proposing a new metric so that the educational potential when using robots can be further developed. Tasks in which students in Japan and UK interact in a 3D virtual space to collaboratively program robots to navigate mazes have resulted in quantitative data of immersion, circuit task complexity and robot task complexity. The data has subsequently been collated to create a proposed new metric for tasks involving robots, which we have termed task fidelity. The paper proposes that task fidelity is a quantitative measure of a set robot task in relation to a learner's solution. By quantifying task fidelity educators utilising robots in schools and in higher education will be able to provide tasks commensurate with the expected successful outcomes achieved by the learners."

Fundamental to this challenge is the fact that formative assessment is inherently a local, concrete instructional practice, as is the work or transforming assessment data into pedagogically responsive action. This paper explores teachers' thinking in their uses of a new data analysis tool to enact evidence-based instructional practices. Furthermore, this paper describes the possible relationships between teachers' existing beliefs, expertise, and routines and their construction of new practices. We show how current theories of assessment do not account for important aspects of formative instruction in practice and discuss the implications for teacher learning."

We believe that this is an especially opportune time to purposely focus on improving the mathematics education of students who have historically been denied access to a high-quality and rigorous mathematics education in the United States, specifically low-income students and students of color (e.g., Kitchen, DePree, Celedon-Pattichis, & Brinkerhoff, 2007; Leonard & Martin, 2013).

The study investigates how teachers' perceptions of their instructional practice shifted as their interactions with students became increasingly mediated by platforms. Findings illuminate how platformization invited digitally mediated surveillance into the classroom and how this surveillance impacted teachers' perceptions of their relationships with students and with content. The authors offer a framework of platformized instruction to guide research on teaching the digital era."

However, to date there has been little reported work that has moved beyond anecdotal accounts of its use within educational situations and studies that have been undertaken in this area have predominantly focused on University students. This paper explores how gamification could potentially benefit a specific student population, children with dyslexia who are transitioning from primary to secondary school. Two teachers from specialist dyslexia teaching centres used classDojo, a gamification platform, during their teaching sessions for one term. We detail how the teachers appropriated the platform in different ways and how this impacted the resulting forms of motivation engendered within the students. These findings have subsequently informed a series of design recommendations presented within the paper regarding how gamification platforms can be optimised for students with dyslexia. We conclude by arguing that our work can serve as a springboard for discussing how gamification platforms could be of use for students with other special educational needs."

The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between children's mathematical literacy at kindergarten entry and preschool attendance, preschool type (i.e., public, private, Head Start, and home-based educational technology providers), and preschool quality. Researchers collected statewide preschool enrollment records and kindergarten-entry mathematical literacy assessment scores for 45,895 public school kindergarten children for one school year. To identify relationships between early mathematical literacy performance and children's preschool attendance, preschool type, and preschool quality, researchers conducted a 2 x 2 Factor ANOVA, independent group means t-tests, and multiple regression analyses. Overall, the results suggested that children from diverse backgrounds experience improved early mathematical literacy when they attended preschool. Therefore, with the limited funding available for preschool, policymakers should consider which children might most benefit from preschool experience and target limited resources to such populations."

For this study, we conducted interviews with both instructional technology administrators in school districts and software developers who build edtech applications to analyze their conceptualization of the term. An open-coding technique was used to analyze the interview data and create subsequent themes from it. We found that the participants' understanding of 'access' varies depending on their industry and professional role. We also found that while there is no standard consensus for what 'access' means, it is clear that its meaning is layered, complex, and contextual. These findings are supported by shifts in research-based definitions of the term - having expanded and narrowed in scope - to include physical possession, supporting infrastructure, and requisite cognition. We conclude with implications for developers to help ensure their products are accessible for adoption by K-12 schools."

In this first article in the issue, we define online learning including its variants, review historical and current contexts, explore its multidimensionality, and assert key issues shaping contemporary online learning. We propose five important lenses: community, engagement, pedagogy, equity, and design-based research, through which scholarly communities are creating knowledge that influences research and practice in online learning contexts. These lenses highlight points of conceptual overlap between the online and psychological learning literatures. The special issue is organized around these lenses and includes an article representing each one, complemented by commentaries that offer critical appraisal and synthesis."

        "The widespread use of educational technology in schools compels teachers to seamlessly integrate technology while developing students' digital competence. As educational technology continually evolves, digital competence becomes a dynamic target. Thus, teacher education must effectively prepare student teachers to teach effectively with technology. Researchers are increasingly examining the concept of teachers' digital competence and how teacher education supports student teachers' acquisition of digital skills for future employability. In Nordic countries like Norway, the term Professional Digital Competence (PDC) frames a teacher's essential knowledge for using digital technology in teaching and learning. Despite this focus, there's limited understanding of how Norwegian teacher education fosters PDC. This scoping review investigates current research on PDC and its implementation within Norwegian teacher education. Findings from numerical and thematic analysis offer insights into the prevalent types of PDC research. Thirty-four peer-reviewed papers were identified and coded along three dimensions: (1) theoretical perspectives, (2) research questions and methods, and (3) application and implementation. The review reveals a predominant focus on student and teacher educator perceptions or self-assessments when measuring digital competence. Our findings show that professional digital competence in teacher education is diverse and multifaceted. However, there are gaps in the current state of knowledge. To address this, we propose a definition and a framework to guide teacher educators. Future research should broaden participant profiles and involve a more diverse group of educators."

In a community college in Hong Kong, two ethics seminars were shifted from face-to-face to face-to-screen mode due to COVID-19 pandemic. They were blended with a popular SRS, Poll Everywhere, to facilitate opinion sharing. Other than verbal discussion, students participated by casting their choices about some ethical dilemmas in real-time through Poll Everywhere. Post-activity survey reflected that the approach of adopting SRS in online ethics learning facilitated participants to express their views, increased participants' engagement and provided participants psychological safety to share opinions. The learning mode contains the nature of both interactivity and sincere sharing, and hence is specifically fit for ethics education."

        "Boys show a stronger preference for digital entertainment games than girls. For this reason, it may be that game-based learning is more acceptable to boys than to girls. Yet game-based learning might improve the performance of both boys and girls, depending upon the instructional design. In a quasi-experimental study with a secret-trail game, effects were examined on students' subject-matter knowledge. Analysis of covariance revealed that both boys and girls of the game intervention group showed a higher test performance, compared to students of the control group. However, different game activities mediated this effect of the secret-trail game on performance: girls seemed to profit more from searching the Internet to complete assignments and boys from competing with others. The performance of both boys and girls was negatively influenced by technical problems. The results are discussed within the framework of gender-inclusive game design."

        "This paper examines the levels of information and communication technology (ICT) literacy among educators at three high schools in Mankweng Circuit where the TV White Spaces Pilot Project has been implemented since July 2013 to promote blended learning. The paper examines survey results among 24 educators in order to demonstrate that the TV White Spaces Pilot Project has not revolutionized teachers' confidence in computer and ICT literacy, e-pedagogies nor digital informatics. Beyond infrastructure resourcing, successful implementation of blended learning is largely dependent upon \"computer and information literacy\" among both students and educators, requiring therefore investments in time and energy for acquisition of instructional methodologies, strategies and skills. For this reason, the ubiquity and inevitability of e-learning in South Africa could potentially underestimate the complexities of establishing pedagogic abilities, skills and confidence in the attendant digital technology informatics among educators, who are challenged to blend digital informatics with conventional didactics."

The objective of this research was to determine to what extent the attitude of first grade high school students about the use of mobile devices in learning can be improved through action research. For this, three phases were carried out: a) diagnosis, b) intervention and c) evaluation. The results revealed that the action research had a positive impact on the opinion of the students regarding the academic use of mobile devices (70 to 80); practical use of social networks (58 to 72); digital identity (39 to 73) and reflective use of ICT (from 73 to 77). This allows to conclude that the application of the research-action methodology can be an effective tool for solving problems in the educational field."

The study surveyed 218 students from a range of disciplines and qualifications. Cluster analysis revealed distinct patterns of engagement with technologies in both personal/social and educational contexts. Some support was found for a connection between personal/social and academic uses of technology. In contrast to the dominant narrative of learners as digitally fluent technology users, the analysis showed the majority of learners were using educational technologies in fairly simplistic ways that satisfy the demands of their course. Significant relationships were found between digital practices in college and subject studied and gender. The discussion draws on the literature of digital literacy practices in order to interpret the findings and inform the planning and development of learning technologies."

Adopting a mixed-methods design, qualitative and quantitative data were collected from focus group interviews, survey and wiki entries. Findings showed that the wiki platform provided educational, technological, and social affordances for the P5 students' collaborative learning. At the same time, constraints were found to be related to technological factors and users' dispositions, which may be counterbalanced by providing scaffolding and selecting wiki variants. Students' attitudes towards the pedagogical value of the wiki were found to be strongly positive after the group project implementation. Overall, this research contributes to the literature on the use of wikis in primary education."

        "Background In 2018, it was found that only a quarter of Grade 3 children in India were reading at grade level. A growing demand for English education has further limited children's literacy achievement. Despite a strong evidence base in favour of using systematic phonics for building English literacy skills, many teachers in India continue to use rote-methods of literacy instruction. Objectives We aimed to examine the efficacy of GraphoLearn (GL) English Rime, a computer-assisted reading intervention, in improving the foundational literacy skills of 1st and 2nd grade students who were attending an English medium school in India. Methods A total of 136 students across 6 classrooms were randomly allocated to play either GL or a control math game over a 5-week intervention period. Students were pre- and post-tested on various English literacy skills using tasks built into the GL software as well as through oral and paper-based tasks. Results and Conclusions Students who played GL showed significantly greater and faster development on in-game measures of letter-sound knowledge, rime unit recognition, and word recognition as compared to students who did not play GL. In addition, GL resulted in greater effects on these measures for students with stronger English literacy skills prior to the start of the intervention. No differences were found between groups on the oral and paper-based tasks. Implications GL was able to quickly and effectively teach critical sub-skills for reading. However, a lack of effects on the out-of-game measures opens the door for further discussion on the successful implementation of such interventions."

The findings shed light on the vital role of vlogging in education over the last decade. This systematic review provides scholars and practitioners in the fields of education and educational technology with valuable information about how to improve learning and teaching through vlogging. The data was collected using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) method. The findings indicated that students and teachers have a positive attitude toward vlogging. Vlogging in higher education is more extensive than in K-12. The main subject in which vlogging is used in K-12 was language, while the main subject in higher education (HE) was found to be reflective practices."

In this paper, we use a state-of-the-art Swedish BERT model to build an automatic concept extractor for the Biology subject using fine-annotated digital textbook data that cover all content for K-12. The model gives a recall measure of 72% and has the potential to be used in real-world settings for use cases that require high recall. Meanwhile, we investigate how input data features influence model performance and provide guidance on howto effectively use text data to achieve the optimal results when building a named entity recognition (NER) model."

These are highly complex, and their apprehension for students is difficult, hence learning content must be developed in a way that reflects the links between science, technology and the surrounding world, in order to achieve great significance as well as greater engagement in the students towards these careers that will contribute to the reduction of dropout rates and school failure. Consequently, students should be given access to educational resources that allow them to effectively manage learning contents, thereby making them meaningful. Educational technologies, in the new models of training centered on the student, the management of knowledge and learning from increasingly developed tools, techniques and methods. Through their high potential for visualization, experimentation and interactivity, they favor the creation of scenarios suitable for this purpose. The objective of the present work was to describe the student's perception of the incorporation of interactive and experimental learning objects (LO-IE) [2] in the teaching and learning process of Discrete Mathematics (MD) subjects, to contribute to the development of content self-management capacity. The study was developed with freshmen of the University of Informatics Sciences (UIS), Cuba. A population of 214 subjects was taken into account, of which 108 conformed the sample, distributed in 4 groups statistically equivalent. They were applied a quasi-experimental design of 4 groups of Solomon [3] with 2 experimental groups and 2 of control, with pretest and posttest. As a quantitative data collection technique, questionnaires measured through the Likert scales were used to determine the students' perception of the use of LO-IE and how they consider themselves to be self-managing content. On the other hand, qualitative observation with an active participation of the teacher, allowed to explore the relationships and interactions that are established during the process. For the analysis of the quantitative results the percentage, mean and standard deviation of the items of the questionnaire were analyzed, with satisfactory results being obtained in most cases. The observation allowed to identify difficulties in the planning of teamwork, communication skills and resistance to change produced by the introduction of treated educational resources."

        "The use of information and communication technologies in education at all types of schools is becoming commonplace nowadays. The generally declared need for the integration of new media and educational technologies in the educational process could represent an important impulse for the development of pedagogical sciences. Some of the modern forms of study in both Czech and foreign schools are altogether based on the use of information and communication technologies. These facts encourage places new demands on teachers who have to be prepared to work with modern ICT and at the same time create appropriate educational materials for such tuition. As a result of this fact, it is necessary to promote new educational techniques and methods derived from them and thus there arises a question whether schools, teachers and teachers-to-be are ready for such a thing.

        "Recently there has been a considerable interest in the Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) framework for effective technology integration (Koehler et al., 2013). Researchers have been measuring how effective their professional development efforts have been for the development of teachers ' TPACK (Graham et al., 2009; Guzey & Roehrig, 2009). So far research is based only on short-term courses, so longitudinal studies are needed to examine the TPACK development of teachers across time (Hoffer & Grandgenett, 2012; Koh & Sing, 2011). A two-year in-service training program of educational technology (60 ECTS), based on the TPACK framework, was developed at Tallinn University Haapsalu College to support in-service teachers to effectively embed ICT into their classroom teaching. The first group of teachers (n=20) enrolled in the program in January 2014. This paper reports some preliminary findings of a longitudinal action research, the main aim of which is to evaluate the impact of the in-service training program of educational technology on teachers' TPACK. The key questions for this research were: how do teachers 'perceptions of their TPACK levels change after participating in the training program for a year; which of the seven knowledge domains of the TPACK framework develop more than others; what is the impact of different knowledge domains on teachers' TPACK perceptions. The TPACK questionnaire developed by Schmidt et al. (2009) was used to measure in-service teachers' self-assessments of their TPACK during the first meeting of the training program and at the end of the first academic year. The research results revealed increase in all the domains of the TPACK framework. There was significant development of the teachers' TK and TPACK, but only limited growth in CK and PK. Strong positive correlations were found between TCK, TPK and TPACK in the post-course survey."

A qualitative study collected information through a semi-structured interview using Zoom. We arrived at the following conclusions after analyzing our findings. The teacher-student interaction has been challenging due to technical difficulties, so motivation with different strategies and work with parents has been an optimal method to face it. Also, further individual challenges have affected the educational process, causing a more significant workload for teachers. Finally, the reflective process has enabled teachers to question their practice and transform it to search for an optimal pedagogical exercise."

        "BackgroundThe coronavirus pandemic has caused a shift in how many teaching, learning and research activities are conducted internationally. Lockdowns compelled all education sectors, including higher education (HE), to adopt a variety of online learning practices at short notice. As these changes in practice have implications beyond the pandemic, more needs to be understood about settings across the globe where the move to online may pose particular challenges. This study brings a focus to how lecturers in a college of education in Nigeria responded to the professional demands of lockdowns and developed strategies for managing educational activities that have relevance during and beyond the pandemic itself.PurposeThe aim of the study reported in this paper was to examine lecturers' perceptions of the management of teaching, learning and research activities during a lockdown, drawing out longer term implications.MethodsData were collected through in-depth, one-to-one interviews with six lecturers from a college of education in Nigeria. Interview data were analysed qualitatively.FindingsDetailed analysis indicated that lecturers' strategies included encouraging students to engage in self-directed learning, as they uploaded learning materials on messaging groups and the college's e-learning platform. However, lecturers felt that the quality of teaching and assessment was compromised by factors including: irregular power supply, poor internet connection, high data costs and some students' limited digital skills. A particular concern was students' lack of interaction on the online platforms, which lecturers perceived to result in a more passive teaching and learning process. Lecturers also experienced difficulties undertaking research activities. A range of strategies and implications for the ongoing management of educational activities was discussed.ConclusionsThe study offers insights into how some of the challenges encountered could be addressed to support sustainable online and blended teaching and learning in the longer term, in settings internationally where there are barriers to accessing online teaching and learning. Crucial aspects include strengthening educational technology training for lecturers and students, enhancing e-learning platforms for teaching practical courses, and enabling lecturers to develop beneficial and valuable online resources."

        "This work aims to inspire, ignite and engage school students to consider STEM at university, by collaborating between a university research group and school students. Learning resources will be co-created with students, based on what they have learnt and their new ideas. These resources will be used to teach future students, in a multiplying effect. We specifically target a widening participation school. Numerous engagement techniques have been used to sustain participation whilst teaching online. Breakout rooms have been used extensively, to provide close interactions between researchers and students. Both male and female researchers deliver the project, to provide role models in particular for the girls amongst the students, who are in the minority. Surveys are being employed before, during and after the project to evaluate the evolution of students' attitudes towards STEM. Given the projected success of this pilot, plans are in place for a national roll-out of virtual co-creation collaborations."

With more frequency applications and programs are developed that allow us to make more things, and in a more efficient way, but in the case of the teaching process this supposes some challenges. The formation of the future professors is among the most significant, and, although they recognize the importance of the technology and their potentials usually they are overwhelmed with the changing dynamics of the digital world. To approach this problem a possibility it is the election of tools with a wide spectrum of capacities to solve problems, like it is the case of MATLAB for the mathematical problems. In this work the potentials of this tool are examined specifically for their use in the subject algorithms, providing methodological recommendations for the work of the future professors."

However, it is unclear whether contingent responsivity from a digital book could provide similar support for children. The effects on story recall and engagement interacting with a digital book that responded contingently on children's vocalizations (contingent book) were investigated, with a focus on the role of individual differences in attention. The study used a within-subject design with 3 experiments from 90 3- to 5-year-old children. Children were presented with a contingent book and 3 noncontingent control conditions: a board book (Experiment 1), a static digital book (Experiment 2), and an animated book (Experiment 3). The use of the contingent book significantly increased children's story recall and was found to be especially useful for children with less developed attention regulation."

Blended learning was the predominant strategy in one course whilst the second course was offered predominantly in the flipped learning mode. Learning outcomes and students' perceptions and preferences were assessed at the end of each module and the results compared. Findings revealed that students preferred flipped learning to blended learning. Also, on the whole, the students performed better (though not significantly) in the flipped course than in the blended course. Implications of these findings for practice and further research are discussed within the context of educational technology implementation in higher education in Ghana particular, and Sub-Saharan Africa in general."

Although much work has been done, effective learning designs that facilitate active learning, conceptual understanding of statistics, and the use of real-data in the classroom are needed. Guided by Merrill's First Principles of Instruction (First Principles), a blended, introductory college-level statistics course that incorporated real data was designed and implemented. A single descriptive case design was used to investigate how the course design facilitated learning and the development of statistical conceptual understanding (i.e., statistical literacy, reasoning, and thinking skills). Results from both quantitative and qualitative data analyses indicated that the course designed using First Principles as a guide was effective in promoting students' conceptual understanding in terms of literacy, reasoning, and thinking statistically. However, students' statistical literacy, specifically, the understanding of statistical terminology did not develop to a satisfactory level as expected."

Using data collected during participant observation and semi-structured interviews with contributors of the firm, we show that this expression lies at the heart of LeWebPeclagogique's marketing strategy and economical model. It also epitomizes its capacity to address teachers and to mobilize them to produce school-proof content displayed on various platforms, playing on the appeal that \"author\" status exerts on teachers. On the other hand, we try to reveal the motivations of teachers who chose to collaborate with LeWebPeclagogique while developing \"proto-communities\" (Baron & Zablot, 2017). Could teachers build specific \"strategies\" (de Certeau, 1980) in order to stage themselves as innovative or \"teaching stars\"? Based on the analysis of semi-structured interviews with teachers occupying the roles of beta-testers, content producers or target audience, we also tried to understand if these collaborations could throw light upon a feeling of deprofessionalization in an institutional context that would lead teachers to work with the private actor."

In Western and secular culture, religious education implies a type of education which is largely separated from academia, and which generally regards religious belief as a fundamental tenet and operating modality, as well as a prerequisite of attendance. Many of the European countries have some kind of religious education. Implemented in school as confessional religious education or non-confessional religious education-as a separate teaching subject or incorporated in other subjects. Aspects - knowledge, creativity, culture of communication with others, teacher evaluation. Like in any education, main determinants and main factors are student, teacher, educational subjects and educational technology. All this in the religious education of 21st century has a specific role in the whole communication process.

Teachers were asked about the kinds of 3D projects they were doing with students and what skills or kn wiedge students were devel Ping by participating in those projects. Participants reported that their students developed a number of skills while working on 3D printing projects, including 3D modeling, creativity, technology literacy, problem-solving, self-directed learning, critical thinking and perseverance Parallels between teacher-identified skills and widely cited lists of 21st-century skills suggest that 3D projects are a promising approach to preparing students for life and work in a digital age."

The analysis took into account both the main bibliometric characteristics of scientific production and the emerging categories. Results: It was observed that most of the scientific production has an empirical nature following three thematic patterns: the current state of Digital Gamification in High School; the benefits that this entails; and the proposals for application and/or improvement. Conclusions: Including Digital Gamification in High School has multiple benefits, but it requires the complicity of all teachers and a broad understanding by students."

        "The recent technologies rise today as a tool of significant importance today, especially in the educational context. In this sense, Augmented Reality (AR) is a technology that is achieving a greater presence in educational centers in the last decade. However, Augmented Reality has not been explored in depth at the Secondary Education stage. Due to this, it is essential to analyze and concentrate the scientific research developed around this educational technology at that stage. Therefore, the aim of this research is to describe the influence that Augmented Reality shows on the motivation and academic performance of students in the Secondary Education stage. In relation to the methodology, a systematic review of the literature has been conducted using the Kitchenham protocol, where several factors have been analyzed, such as subjects, activities, and electronic implementation devices, together with the effects on motivation and student's academic performance. The Scopus and Web of Science (WoS) databases have been used to search for scientific papers, with a total of 344 investigations being analyzed between 2012 and 2022. The methodological stages considered were the formulation of research questions, the choice of data sources, search strategies, inclusion and exclusion criteria and quality assessment, and finally, data extraction and synthesis. The results obtained have shown that the use of AR in the classroom provides higher levels of motivation, reflected by factors such as attention, relevance, confidence, and satisfaction, and reflects better results in the tests carried out on the experimental groups compared to the control groups, which means an improvement in the academic performance of students. These results supply a fundamental theoretical basis, where the different teachers should be supported for the incorporation of AR in the classroom, since how this educational technology has been shown offers great opportunities. Likewise, the development of research in areas not so addressed can further clarify the generality of AR based on its influence on learning. In addition, the fields of natural sciences and logical-mathematical have been the most addressed, managing to implement their contents through object modeling. In short, this research highlights the importance of incorporating Augmented Reality into all areas and educational stages, since it is a significant improvement in the teaching and learning process."

Facilitating conditions, technology complexity, and perceived anxiety were added to the original TAM as extended variables to examine their influence on Chinese EFL teachers' online teaching. Quantitative data were obtained from 158 teachers in Chinese primary and secondary schools and universities. Data were analyzed using structural equation modeling (SEM), and the extended TAM was found to be valid in explaining Chinese EFL teachers' online teaching intentions during quarantine. Teachers' behavioral intentions were significantly associated with their attitudes and perceived usefulness of online teaching. Their perceptions of ease of use significantly influenced usefulness, which was significantly associated with teachers' attitudes. Facilitating conditions have been suggested as an important antecedent to ease of use. Suggestions were provided for teachers and educational administrators to revisit the affordances of online teaching with the aim of coping with emergencies."

The main visible result of the project was published on the social network presenting information the students found. The findings stimulate a discussion to evaluate health effects of excessive salt intake in confrontation with the importance of NaCl for the human body. To assess the affective impact of the project, the IMI tool with 25 items divided in three subscales (enjoyment, value/utility, perceived choice) was used.to . The results suggest the students' slightly positive attitudes towards enjoyment and value of the project and neutral attitudes towards their perceived choice. This allows to consider the project successful."

        "The \"Real Classroom Lab\" (RCL) is an innovative initiative for building teachers' digital competence by inviting companies to try out new educational technologies together with real teachers and students in authentic classroom settings. The project was carried out in Sweden over the past two years and enrolled three schools in the same municipality, from primary to upper secondary school, with a focus on STEM learning. As the project is coming to an end, the purpose of this paper is to provide a researcher's perspective from participating in an on-going evaluation of the full project (Sep. 2017 - Sep. 2019). The overarching challenge has been to develop a systematic approach, or method, for effective collaboration between schools, the edtech industry and the academy (which provided scientific support). The common objective was to create a meeting ground that facilitates knowledge exchange of innovative ICT solutions and how they work with the target users (teachers and students) that ultimately lead to increased digital competence among teachers, and better results in STEM subjects for students on all levels. The schools enrolled in the RCL project opened up as test beds for a variety of companies and products, ranging from AI-based software in math to activity bracelets and microbit computing. The present paper focuses on issues, lessons learned and experiences that can be brought together by some encompassing research questions, such as: How is \"digital competence\" captured and developed by the project? What knowledge needs are made visible as teachers try out new technologies in practice? How can we measure learning from the project activities, such as by pilot studies and test protocols? What is the value of a scientifically based approach and how does research contribute to answering these questions for all parties concerned? Focusing on the last question, this is the first time the results of the RCL project are communicated to a wider community in education."

At the same time, gamification, which uses game mechanics in a non-game context, is an used strategy to engage people in reaching their goals in different contexts. Thus, this paper aims to present software guidelines for the design of gamified educational technologies to patients with this deficit. The requirements were compiled based on the results of a study conducted with parents, psycho-pedagogues, psychologists and speech therapists. Two main guideline categories were found: (i) behavioral strategies and (ii) gamification elements used, the first being composed of 17 strategies and the second by 12 gamification elements. From these categories and data analysis, 16 system requirements were proposed for the development of gamified applications to people with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder."

Then stepwise multiple regression analysis was used to predict the factors influencing m-learning satisfaction (SA). The results showed that gender differences did not have a significant impact on satisfaction, but the differences in grades and parents' education levels did. In addition, it was found that perceived usefulness and behavioral intention can be used as positive predictors of satisfaction with mobile learning. Finally, this paper puts forward some suggestions to improve users' satisfaction with m-learning."

To integrate these technologies, it is necessary to take into account the context and to have teachers trained in teaching digital skills. The aim of this article is to analyse experiences that can be considered as good educational practices supported by advanced technologies in the field of science education and at all levels of formal education. Some selection criteria have been used to guarantee that they are real experiences with digital technologies and that they present evaluation data. The educational level (infant, primary, secondary and university) and the type of technology used (robotics, extended reality, platforms/apps, video games and artificial intelligence) have been chosen as classification categories, highlighting the analysis of the CREATE-Skills project. It is based on the creation of a collaborative platform to promote cooperation between teachers and families in order to implement active teaching of scientific disciplines in primary school. The main conclusion is the evidence of the usefulness and good results of the use of technologies in the field of STEM education and at all stages and levels of the educational system."

        "The enhancing migration processes in various Russia's regions lead to a wider ethnic range of students in educational institutions. Therefore, pedagogues should know special educational technologies associated with the specifics of students' ethnic identity. All this makes the issue under study relevant. The goal of the paper is to reveal the involvement of parents of junior schoolchildren - the representatives of non-indigenous nationalities in school education and the involvement of professional educational technologies in family education. The technology of a consultative dialogue, which enables to reveal the challenges of family education and consider them in a holistic manner as well as to assist in their solution from the perspective of a current theory of education, is the leading method for studying this issue. For this purpose, the authors have created a multi-ethnic child-adult consultative center. The paper shows the problems of training and education of junior schoolchildren - representatives of non-indigenous nationalities revealed during the study. It defines the needs for arranging a consultative dialogue between pedagogues and parents of junior schoolchildren on the issues of their education, socialization, and adaptation in a Russian-speaking region. The paper defines the principles of integration of family and school education on the example of physical education. It gives the topics of consultations on the integration of family and school physical education, which are of most interest for the representatives of non-indigenous nationalities. The paper proves that the implementation of these results will enable to optimize the process of socialization and adaptation of junior schoolchildren of non-indigenous nationalities in a Russian-speaking region and will contribute to the consolidation of schoolchildren. The materials of the paper can be useful for the pedagogues at other levels of education as well as for specialists of further education system in working with multi-ethnic child groups and for social pedagogues in working with migrant families and creating conflict-free educational environment."

A non-probabilistic sample was selected from the students enrolled in a compulsory module of the program (n = 38). The questionnaire was validated and structured in 5 items and 24 sub-items with open and closed questions. The majority of the participants (81.58%) believe that they will use the flipped classroom methodology. On the other hand, lack of training in audio-visual production and of experience in their first years of teaching were the main reasons given by those who affirm that they will not use this methodology with their students. The proposal of flipped classrooms aroused in the participants a greater conviction of the suitability of its use, as well as a greater awareness of their own limitations regarding this method."

        "Lower than expected high-stakes examination scores were being observed in a first-year general psychology class. This research sought an alternate approach that would assist students in preparing for high-stakes examinations. The purpose of this study was to measure the effectiveness of an alternate teaching approach based on the testing effect to address low high-stakes examination scores. This was accomplished through the introduction of an online quizzing application that utilized a game show-like user interface called Kahoot (TM). The results showed a significant difference in high-stakes examination scores for students who utilized Kahoot (TM) versus students who did not. It can be suggested that pedagogical tools like Kahoot (TM) have the potential to enhance and improve high-stakes examination scores at the college and university level. Students that used Kahoot (TM) felt positive about their experience. The results of this study also suggest that creating a fun and engaging environment also supports improved academic performance."

This study proposes a novel predictive modeling method to address the research gaps in existing performance prediction research. The gaps addressed include: the lack of existing research focus on performance prediction rather than identifying key performance factors; the lack of common predictors identified for both K-12 and higher education environments; and the misplaced focus on absolute engagement levels rather than relative engagement levels. Two datasets, one from higher education and the other from a K-12 online school with 13 368 students in more than 300 courses, were applied using the predictive modeling technique. The results showed the newly suggested approach had higher overall accuracy and sensitivity rates than the traditional approach. In addition, two generalizable predictors were identified from instruction-intensive and discussion-intensive courses."

Children in a preschool setting have previously been shown to benefit from playing educational games with the KindSAR robot. The experiment presented here was designed to examine how KindSAR can be used to engage preschool children in constructive learning. The basic principle of constructivist education is that learning occurs when the learner is actively involved in a process of knowledge construction. In this study, storytelling was used as a paradigm of a constructive educational activity. An interactive robot served as a teacher assistant by telling prerecorded stories to small groups of children while incorporating song and motor activities in the process. Our results show that the children enjoyed interacting with the robot and accepted its authority. This study demonstrates the feasibility and expected benefits of incorporating KindSAR in preschool education. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

This two-year case study aimed to find ways to foster the digital competence of young students in the early years of primary school education. The results show that spontaneous problems provided opportunities for students to show their competence and fostered their engagement. In addition, long-lasting changes were associated with learning digital competence at the beginning of primary school. Furthermore, all children were eager in using digital technology for learning, but their commitment in tracking their own development and using digital technology to make their learning transparent to homes varied. This study shows that when fostering young students' evolving digital competence, teachers need to consider digital technology use holistically and in long-term."

This paper presents insights around how teachers currently use physical manipulatives to inform future MR designs in the classroom. Manipulatives are physical objects used for teaching; Examples include, coins, blocks, puzzles markers etc. K-5 teachers have been using physical manipulatives to help illustrate abstract concepts for decades. Physical manipulatives have proven high value for students in the classroom [7] and their high level of adoption by grade school teachers makes them a potential candidate for introducing MR into the classroom. In this research, we use participatory design, journey maps and interviews to identify teacher challenges with current physical manipulatives and explore potential design directions for MR manipulatives in the classroom. Our preliminary findings suggest that MR could help improve autonomy around student learning and increase opportunity for collaboration between peers, as well as between teacher and student."

This work, framed into the European CREATESkills project, has been carried out in the Region of Murcia through a quantitative analysis of the data thrown by the questionnaires applied to teachers and students. The questionnaires included aspects such as the resources and spaces, the methodological strategies followed and the use made of the new technologies. Among its main results, we find that teachers need more resources and request more training to improve STEM teaching, while students say they would like to do more experiments and use new technologies. In conclusion, special attention must be focused on the use of active methodologies, the improvement of the digital teaching competence and the development of practical and experimental activities to strength STEM contents in the Primary classrooms."

Illustrating initial empirical findings from the research project Smart Schools, we analyse how characteristics of CD and PD are challenged or affirmed when unfolding in school practice. Our data show how three key logics substantially challenge ideas of CD and PD in digital school development processes, namely: (1) the idea of digital school development as a set of sequential processes; (2) an understanding of digital and analogue as opposing conditions; and (3) the conceptualisation of knowledge hierarchies between students, teachers, and external stakeholders. Simultaneously, we observe perspectives that affirm both approaches. Consequently, we argue that the notions of critique and participation must be rethought to apply CD and PD in everyday school development processes."

In 2012, the IT department at Lewis & Clark College moved from a pre-determined schedule of training classes to a mix of scheduled workshops and \"TBD\" (To Be Determined) classes scheduled based on interest and availability. This change, along with adding on-demand resources such as screencasts and lynda.com, has enabled us to respond better to the training needs of our campus community and created opportunities for long-term engagement. This paper examines the factors we considered when making these adjustments to our training workshop schedule and the campus response (which has been mostly positive).

Based on the multisource data such as students' learning situation, learning duration, and academic performance, this paper builds a student English learning analysis system that realizes the integration of multisource data, completes the unified processing and analysis of multisource data, and then displays it through the interface. The system helps English teachers to guide students in different degrees according to the students' English learning situation and academic performance, so that English teachers have a clearer and more comprehensive understanding of students' learning and living conditions and timely guide students with incorrect learning attitudes, so as to avoid students' detours."

In the educational background of the \"Internet+\", the traditional classroom teaching mode has been unable to meet the students' personalized and differentiated learning needs unlimited by the time and space. The teaching mode based on the \"Internet+\" is an important part of the modern educational technologies, and it is also a beneficial supplement of the traditional classroom teaching. In this paper, with Xi'an Innovation College of Yan'an University as an example, the author analyzes the current situations of the English teaching models in independent colleges and the new teaching model of the \"Internet plus classrooms\", and puts forward based on the countermeasures to improve the English teaching mode in independent colleges based on the \"Internet+\"."

        "Since the importance of the usage of educational technologies is increasing day by day, teachers need to save the lessons from traditionality and let the students gain their own technological literacy. The aim of this study here is to maintain the thoughts of the teachers, students and school administrators on the issue of using learning technologies based on constructivist approach at the primary school level with comparisons and then trying to improve the educational quality of our country in order to catch up with the world wide reforms done in this field. Interview and observation techniques, as the methods of qualitative research, are used in this study. As a result of this study it is found that the teachers are not capable of using the whole capacity of the learning technologies. That is why there should be an increase in the number of in-house education seminars. Not only the contents of those seminars should be designed for effective usage of technological tools but also there should be exercises for teachers to have active role during those seminars and teachers should be informed with the concept of constructivist education."

To do this, a sample of 319 Primary Education (5th Year) and 246 Secondary Education (2nd Year ESO) activities contained in two state-run publishing houses are quantified and analyzed. The results reflect a small number of tasks that appeal to technological resources in the manuals analyzed, as well as the development of strategies that imply a low level of cognitive resolution. This would confirm that the substitution of textbook format -from analogue to digital support-does not entail a change in the school routines and in the approach of the model of learning activities in school textbooks of Social Sciences."

        "Information technology has entered every aspect of life. The music classroom is no exception for training music talents. The development of information technology has become an inevitable trend of social development. Not only the call of the era of computer multimedia teaching but also the music curriculum standard under the background of quality education has put forward high requirements for today's computers. From this, we can realize that it is crucial to transform teaching concepts, actively practice and explore, and seek new teaching models. As the main auxiliary teaching method, multimedia technology is known and used by most primary and secondary schools, and is widely used in music classroom teaching. This paper deeply analyzes the role and position of multimedia in music teaching in junior high school music classroom teaching, compares multimedia technology with other educational technology means, and explains the advantages and limitations of the implementation of music classroom teaching assisted by multimedia educational technology means. At the same time, this paper turns the cognitive problem of selective attention into the problem of measuring the auditory attractiveness of objectively existing music parts. The specific process is as follows: first, on the CQT spectrum of real music audio, this paper uses the auditory cognitive model based on auditory saliency, and uses the Bayesian inference mechanism of time series to propose the calculation method of quantitative features of auditory saliency. Then, TANN network is used to identify multiple auditory significant subbands as candidate semitones, and a priori knowledge obtained from the generalized chord structure is introduced to standardize the chord like structure at each time in the candidate melody stream, which improves the accuracy of the melody stream's description of the original music. Finally, according to the data analysis of teaching practice, the teaching objectives of \"order\" and \"circulation\" in social and natural life have been well realized through \"rhythm\" insight in this teaching practice unit."
